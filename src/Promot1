Fact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.
In the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. 
When a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.
