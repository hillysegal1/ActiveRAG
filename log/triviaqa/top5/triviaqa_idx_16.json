The viscosity of the magma in composite volcanoes is typically high, allowing gas to build up and create explosive eruptions.

In the context of geology, these terms refer to different types of volcanoes.\n\n2. **Understanding Composite Volcanoes**: Composite volcanoes, also known as stratovolcanoes, are characterized by their steep profiles and are formed from alternating layers of lava flows, ash, and other volcanic debris. They are typically associated with explosive eruptions.\n\n3. **Understanding Shield Volcanoes**: Shield volcanoes have broad, gently sloping sides and are primarily built up by the flow of low-viscosity lava. They tend to produce non-explosive eruptions and cover large areas.\n\n4. **Understanding Cinder Cone Volcanoes**: Cinder cone volcanoes are the simplest type of volcano, formed from the accumulation of volcanic debris around a single vent, resulting in a cone-shaped hill. They are usually small and have steep slopes.\n\n5. **Categorization**: Since all three types\u2014Composite, Shield, and Cinder Cone\u2014are related to volcanic activity and formation, they can be categorized under the classification of volcanoes.\n\n6. **Integration of Additional Knowledge**: The retrieved passages do not directly address the geological context of these terms. However, they provide insights into the use of the term \"composite\" in other fields (e.g., environmental engineering) and mention \"shield\" in a construction context. This indicates that the model may have a broader understanding of the term \"composite\" beyond geology, which could lead to confusion. \n\n7. **Addressing Gaps**: The model should be updated to clarify that while \"composite\" can refer to various materials in engineering, in the context of this question, it specifically refers to composite volcanoes. Additionally, the model should recognize that \"shield\" can refer to both geological formations and construction types, necessitating context for accurate interpretation.\n\n### Answer:\nVolcanoes."}], "question_info": {"question": "Composite, Shield and Cinder Cone are all types of what?", "passages": ["CE is not \"sandbags\". Contained sand (CS) uses sand fill or any fill too dry or with poor cohesion that performs structurally like sandbags. CS must be built with solid-weave fabric bags and have good protection from fabric damage, relying on the strength of the bag fabric for wall strength. CS needs more vertical reinforcement for both shear and out-of-plane strength than CE, or may require a structural skin. Some builders use narrow bags of contained sand as wall infill. \n", "Common shield construction types include:\n", "Composite liners are used in municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills to reduce water pollution. A composite liner is made of a geomembrane along with a geosynthetic clay liner. Composite-liner systems are better at reducing leachate migration into the subsoil than either a clay liner or a single geomembrane layer.\n", "AlSiC composites are suitable replacements for copper-molybdenum (CuMo) and copper-tungsten (CuW) alloys; they have about 1/3 the weight of copper, 1/5 of CuMo, and 1/6 of CuW, making them suitable for weight-sensitive applications; they are also stronger and stiffer than copper. They are stiff, lightweight, and strong. They can be used as heatsinks, substrates for power electronics (e.g. IGBTs and high-power LEDs), heat spreaders, housings for electronics, and lids for chips, e.g. microprocessors and ASICs.
