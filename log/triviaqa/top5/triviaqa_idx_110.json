This proclamation was a formal declaration that established the United States' intention to remain neutral in the conflicts between Britain and France, which were significant at the time.\n\n2. **Contextual Background**: The geopolitical landscape of the late 18th century was marked by the French Revolutionary Wars, where the United States faced pressure from both Britain and France. Washington's decision to issue the Proclamation of Neutrality was influenced by the need to maintain national stability and avoid the pitfalls of foreign alliances, which could lead to military entanglements.\n\n3. **Long-term Policy Implications**: Washington's Proclamation of Neutrality laid the groundwork for a broader policy of non-interventionism that would be echoed in his **Farewell Address** in 1796. In this address, he warned against \"foreign entanglements\" and the dangers of forming permanent alliances, reinforcing the principles established in the Proclamation.\n\n4. **Causal Relationships**: The issuance of the Proclamation of Neutrality can be seen as a direct response to the existing tensions in Europe. This decision not only prevented immediate involvement in foreign conflicts but also influenced American foreign policy for decades, establishing a precedent for future leaders regarding the importance of neutrality.\n\n5. **Political Divisions**: The internal political divisions at the time, with Federalists favoring Britain and Jeffersonian Republicans favoring France, further complicated the situation. Washington's neutral stance was a strategic choice to unify the nation and prevent domestic conflict over foreign alliances.\n\n6. **Historical Significance**: Understanding Washington's decisions in this context enhances our ability to draw parallels between historical and contemporary foreign policy challenges. It illustrates the importance of strategic neutrality and the potential consequences of foreign entanglements.\n\n### Answer:\nThe title of George Washington's pronouncement in 1793 that provided a basis for the USA to avoid any involvement in foreign conflicts is the **Proclamation of Neutrality**. This proclamation established a foundational policy of non-interventionism, which was later reinforced in his **Farewell Address** in 1796, where he warned against the dangers of foreign alliances and entanglements."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nWhat was the title of George Washingtons pronouncement in 1793 that provided a basis for the USA to avoid any involvement in foreign conflicts?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n[\"After Britain and France went to war in 1792, George Washington declared neutrality, with unanimous support of his cabinet, after deciding that the treaty with France of 1778 did not apply.
