The prefix \"zoo-\" comes from the Greek word \"zoon,\" which means \"animal,\" and the suffix \"-phobia\" refers to an irrational fear or aversion. Therefore, combining these two parts, zoophobia generally refers to a fear of animals. \n\nHowever, based on the retrieved passages, we can enhance this understanding by noting that zoophobia specifically refers to the non-sensible fear of dangerous or threatening animals, such as wild dogs (e.g., wolves, dingoes, coyotes), big cats, bears, or venomous snakes. This indicates that while zoophobia can encompass a fear of animals in general, it is particularly associated with those perceived as dangerous.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to recognize that zoophobia can also refer to a broader category of animal phobias, which includes an irrational fear or dislike of any non-human animals. This distinction highlights that zoophobia is not limited to fears of dangerous animals but can also include a general aversion to all animals.\n\nFurthermore, the impact of zoophobia on an individual's daily life is significant, as it can cause distress or dysfunction. This aspect underscores the severity of the phobia and its implications for mental health and daily functioning.\n\nBy integrating these points into the model's knowledge base, we can ensure a more nuanced understanding of zoophobia, distinguishing it from general fears of animals and recognizing its potential impact on individuals.\n\n**Answer:**\nZoophobia is a fear of animals, specifically characterized as a non-sensible fear of dangerous or threatening animals such as wild dogs, big cats, bears, or venomous snakes. It can also refer to a broader irrational fear or dislike of any non-human animals, and it may cause significant distress or dysfunction in an individual's everyday life."}], "question_info": {"question": "What is zoophobia a fear of?", "passages": ["Zoophobia\n", "Zoophobia is the non-sensible fear of dangerous or threatening animals, such as wild dogs (example: wolves, dingoes, and coyotes), big cats, bears or venomous snakes.
