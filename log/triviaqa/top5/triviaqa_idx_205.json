The capital city serves as the location of the central government and is significant in both political and cultural contexts.\n\nFrom the retrieved knowledge, we confirm that:\n\n1. **Taipei is the capital of Taiwan**: This is explicitly stated in multiple authoritative passages, affirming that \"Taipei is the capital and a special municipality of Taiwan (officially known as the Republic of China).\"\n\n2. **Taipei as the \"de facto\" capital**: The information indicates that \"Taipei in Taiwan has been the 'de facto' capital of the Republic of China since 1949.\" This detail is crucial for understanding the historical and political significance of Taipei in relation to the ROC.\n\n3. **Consistency in information**: The passages consistently affirm that the capital is Taipei, with multiple confirmations (\"Capital: Taipei\").\n\n4. **Contradictory information**: The mention of \"State capital: Taiping\" is misleading, as Taiping is not recognized as the capital of Taiwan. This could lead to confusion and should be corrected to maintain factual accuracy.\n\n### Summary of Updates to Model Knowledge:\n- The capital of Taiwan is confirmed to be Taipei, which is a special municipality and has been the \"de facto\" capital since 1949.\n- The reference to Taiping as a state capital is incorrect and should be disregarded to prevent misinformation.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The language model should be updated to reinforce that Taipei is the capital of Taiwan and clarify that Taiping is not the capital. This will help alleviate potential model illusions and ensure accurate information dissemination.\n\n### Answer:\nThe capital of Taiwan is Taipei."}], "question_info": {"question": "What is the capital of Taiwan?", "passages": ["Taipei is the capital and a special municipality of Taiwan (officially known as the Republic of China).\n", "BULLET::::- Taipei in Taiwan has been the \"de facto\" capital of the Republic of China since 1949.\n", "State capital: Taiping\n", "BULLET::::- Capital : Taipei\n", "BULLET::::- Capital : Taipei\n"], "__answers__": ["Taihoku", "Taihoku", "Taipei city", "Taipei", "Taipei", "Taipei City", "T\u00e1ib\u011bi", "Taipeh", "Capital of the Republic of China", "Capital of the Republic of China", "T'ai-pei", "Tai-pak", "taibei city", "taipai", "T'aipei", "t\u00e1ibei", "capital of taiwan", "tai pak", "taipeh", "T\u00e1ibei", "taipi", "TAIPEI", "taipei", "taihoku", "taibei", "t\u00e2i pak", "Taibei City", "tapei", "t ai pei taiwan", "tai pei", "t ai pei", "Taipak", "Taipi", "Tai Pei", "taipei city taiwan", "Tapei", "\u81fa\u5317", "\u53f0\u5317", "Daihoku", "Taibei", "T'ai-Pei", "t\u00e2ipak", "taipei city", "taipet", "\u53f0\u5317\u5e02", "taipei taiwan", "Taipai", "t\u00e1ib\u011bi", "geography of taipei", "T\u00e2i-Pak", "T'ai-pei, Taiwan", "Tai-Pei", "Taipet", "daihoku", "t aipei", "T\u00e2ipak", "Capital of Taiwan", "T\u00e2i-pak", "Taipei, Taiwan", "The Geography of Taipei", "capital of republic of china", "UN/LOCODE:TWTPE", "\u81fa\u5317\u5e02", "un locode twtpe", "taipak", "Tai-Pak", "Taipei City, Taiwan"]}}
