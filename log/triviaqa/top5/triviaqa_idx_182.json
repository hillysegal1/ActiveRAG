This means that the value of the fraction is strictly less than one. For example, in the fraction 3/5, the numerator is 3 and the denominator is 5, satisfying the condition for a proper fraction.\n\n2. **Identifying the Numerator**: The question specifically asks about the numerator of a proper fraction. By definition, the numerator must always be a number that is less than the denominator in a proper fraction. This relationship is crucial for understanding the fraction's value and its classification.\n\n3. **Generalizing the Numerator**: For any proper fraction represented as a/b (where a is the numerator and b is the denominator), the numerator a must satisfy the condition a < b. This general rule applies to all proper fractions, reinforcing the concept that the numerator is inherently less than the denominator.\n\n4. **Examples**: To illustrate this concept, consider the following examples:\n   - In the fraction 1/2, the numerator is 1, which is less than the denominator 2.\n   - In the fraction 3/4, the numerator is 3, which is less than the denominator 4.\n   - In the fraction 5/6, the numerator is 5, which is less than the denominator 6.\n   In each case, the numerator is less than the denominator, confirming that these are proper fractions.\n\n5. **Properties of Proper Fractions**: The absolute value of a proper fraction is strictly less than one, which further emphasizes the relationship between the numerator and denominator.
