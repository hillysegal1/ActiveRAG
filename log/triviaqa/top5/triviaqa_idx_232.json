Initially, Moctezuma welcomed Cort\u00e9s, which reflects a complex interplay of diplomacy and power dynamics.\n\n2. **Capture of Moctezuma II**: On November 14, 1519, Cort\u00e9s seized Moctezuma II, effectively taking him hostage. This act marked a significant power shift, as it symbolized the beginning of Spanish dominance over the Aztecs. The imposition of a Catholic cross on the Templo Mayor further illustrated this shift.\n\n3. **Escalation of Conflict**: While Cort\u00e9s was away dealing with other Spanish forces, his second-in-command, Pedro de Alvarado, executed a preemptive massacre of Aztec nobles during a religious festival. This brutal action incited a strong backlash from the Aztecs, leading to increased hostility towards the Spanish.\n\n4. **Deposition of Moctezuma**: In the wake of the massacre and growing unrest, the ruling council of Tenochtitlan voted to depose Moctezuma. They elected his brother, Cuitlahuac, as the new emperor. This decision indicates a significant shift in loyalty and authority among the Aztecs, directly influenced by the violent actions of the Spanish.\n\n5. **Moctezuma's Death**: Moctezuma was struck by a sling stone during the unrest and died several days later.
