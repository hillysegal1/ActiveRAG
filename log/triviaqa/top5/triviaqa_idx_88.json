The retrieved passages provide limited information, primarily focusing on the dates associated with the title of Lord Tweedsmuir (1875\u20131940) but do not explicitly mention John Buchan's name.\n5. It is important to clarify that the dates in the passages correspond to the lifespan of John Buchan, which reinforces the connection between him and the title of Lord Tweedsmuir.\n6. Therefore, the model should be updated to explicitly include that John Buchan was the writer and politician who became Lord Tweedsmuir, along with the context of his role as Governor General of Canada.\n\nBy integrating this information, the model can enhance its accuracy regarding historical figures and their titles, ensuring that it does not overlook significant details that could lead to factual errors.\n\n**Answer:**\nJohn Buchan"}], "question_info": {"question": "Which writer and politician became Lord Tweedsmuir?", "passages": ["BULLET::::- The Lord Tweedsmuir (1875\u20131940)\n", "BULLET::::- 19451964: The Rt Hon.
