He ran against Carlos Duque, who was backed by the authoritarian regime of Manuel Noriega. Endara won the election decisively, with reports indicating he received nearly three times the votes of Duque. However, the Noriega regime annulled the election results shortly after, on May 10, 1989, claiming \"massive US interference\" as the justification for this action.\n\nThe annulment of the election results led to significant political unrest and international condemnation. Various foreign observers, including the Catholic Church and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, certified Endara's victory despite the regime's allegations of fraud. This situation escalated tensions, prompting the U.S. to increase its military presence in the Canal Zone, reflecting the geopolitical stakes involved.\n\nFollowing the annulment, Endara faced violence from Noriega supporters, which underscored the risks associated with opposing an authoritarian regime. The political crisis culminated in a U.S. invasion of Panama on December 20, 1989. In the aftermath of the invasion, Endara was sworn in as president at a U.S. military installation, and on December 27, 1989, Panama's Electoral Tribunal invalidated Noriega's annulment, confirming Endara's electoral victory.\n\nThis sequence of events illustrates a clear cause-and-effect relationship: Endara's electoral victory led to the annulment by the Noriega regime, which in turn prompted international intervention.
