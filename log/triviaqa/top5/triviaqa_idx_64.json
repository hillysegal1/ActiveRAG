The name 'The Angel of Christian Charity' was created as a Christian reinterpretation of Anteros. However, this name did not resonate with the public, and the statue became more widely recognized by the name \"Eros,\" which refers to the Greek god of sensual love.\n\n2. **Public Reception**: The statue's location in a vibrant and somewhat controversial area (the theatre district) contributed to mixed feelings about its appropriateness as a memorial. Many people found the statue too sensual for its intended purpose, which led to a public debate about its meaning and significance.

Following the unveiling there were numerous complaints. Some felt it was sited in a vulgar part of town (the theatre district), and others felt that it was too sensual as a memorial for a famously sober and respectable Earl. Some of the objections were tempered by renaming the statue as The Angel of Christian Charity, which was the nearest approximation that could be invented in Christian terms for the role Anteros played in the Greek pantheon. However, the name never became widely known and the statue was thence referred to as \"Eros\", the god of sensual love; inappropriate some said in relation to the Earl's commemoration, but hailed by others as an ironic representation of the more carnal side of the neighbourhood, into which Soho had developed.\n", "Liberal Democrat councillor Jonathan Wallace, who opposed constructing the statue missed the decisive council vote having taken a new job. Despite any early opposition The Angel is now considered to be a landmark for North East England.\n", "A statue of Lucian Tapiedi, the one indigenous Papuan among the Anglican martyrs of New Guinea, is installed among the niches with other 20th-century Christian martyrs from the wider Church, over the west door of Westminster Abbey in London.
