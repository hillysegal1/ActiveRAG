Denmark is located in Northern Europe and consists of the Jutland Peninsula and numerous islands. The only land border that Denmark has is with Germany, which is located to the south of the Jutland Peninsula. Other neighboring countries, such as Sweden and Norway, are separated from Denmark by water (the \u00d8resund Strait and the Kattegat, respectively).
