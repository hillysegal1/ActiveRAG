The 1984 Winter Paralympics, held in Innsbruck, Austria, were the first organized by the International Co-ordinating Committee (ICC), indicating a formalization of the event. Additionally, the tradition of holding the Winter Paralympics every four years, initially coinciding with the Summer Paralympics, reflects the growing recognition and support for athletes with disabilities.\n\nThe 1992 Winter Paralympics were particularly noteworthy as they were the first to occur concurrently with the Olympic Games, showcasing the increasing integration of athletes with disabilities into the broader sporting community. This evolution highlights the importance of the Winter Paralympics in promoting inclusivity and changing societal attitudes toward disability in sports.\n\nBy establishing a timeline of events and understanding the causal relationships between them, I can infer that the establishment of the Winter Paralympics in 1976 was a pivotal moment that led to greater recognition and support for athletes with disabilities, influencing the structure and organization of future events.\n\n### Answer:\nThe first Winter Paralympics were held in 1976 in \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, Sweden."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nWhen were the first Winter Paralympics held?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The 1984 Winter Paralympic Games (German: \"Paralympische Winterspiele 1984\") were the third Winter Paralympics.
