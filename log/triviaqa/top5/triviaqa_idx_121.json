A mullet is a star symbol characterized by having straight arms and typically five points. This distinguishes it from other star-like symbols, such as the estoile, which has wavy rays. The term \"mullet\" is derived from the Latin word \"mulus,\" meaning \"a star,\" which emphasizes its celestial connotation.\n\nIn heraldic tradition, the mullet serves multiple purposes. It is often used as an heraldic charge, which is a symbol or emblem displayed on a shield or coat of arms. The mullet is recognized as an ensign of knightly rank, meaning it is associated with nobility and chivalry. This association is significant because it reflects the social hierarchy and the importance of knighthood in historical contexts.\n\nMoreover, the mullet has genealogical implications; it is traditionally used in British heraldry as a mark of cadency for the third son in a family. This means that the presence of a mullet on a coat of arms can indicate the birth order of sons within a noble family, which is crucial for understanding inheritance and lineage.\n\nIn summary, the mullet is not just a decorative element; it carries deep cultural, historical, and genealogical meanings. Its representation as a star can symbolize divine qualities, excellence, or guidance, further enriching its significance in heraldry.\n\n### Answer:\nA 'mullet' on a coat of arms is a heraldic symbol that represents a star with five straight points.
