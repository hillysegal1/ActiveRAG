One of the most notable strategies is the ability to expel a cloud of ink. This ink serves to obscure the vision of the predator, allowing the octopus to escape.

The ink is a dark substance that creates a smokescreen, giving the octopus a chance to hide or flee.\n\nAdditionally, the blanket octopus specifically uses ink to intimidate potential predators, which reinforces the idea that ink spraying is a common defensive behavior among octopuses.

In some cases, the female blanket octopus unfurls her large net-like membranes to increase her apparent size, further enhancing her defensive posture.\n\nThese behaviors collectively illustrate the complexity of octopus defense strategies, emphasizing that while ink spraying is a primary response, other behaviors such as displaying colors and altering body shape also play significant roles in their defense.\n\n**Answer:**\nAn octopus sprays ink when threatened, which serves to obscure the vision of predators and allows the octopus to escape.

He only communicates with the bugs and provides comfort to everyone by spraying water. However, he is only capable of doing so when the hose he is connected to is on.\n", "While octopuses generally avoid humans, attacks have occasionally been verified. For example, a Pacific octopus, said to be nearly perfectly camouflaged, \"lunged\" at a diver and \"wrangled\" over his camera. Another diver recorded the encounter on video.\n", "Avoidance learning in octopuses has been known since 1905. Noxious stimuli, for example electric shocks, have been used as \"negative reinforcers\" for training octpuses, squid and cuttlefish in discrimination studies and other learning paradigms. Repeated exposure to noxious stimuli can have long-term effects on behaviour. It has been shown that in octopuses, electric shocks can be used to develop a passive avoidance response leading to the cessation of attacking a red ball.\n"], "__answers__": ["Ink", "Inks", "Inky (liquid)", "inks", "printing ink", "ink", "inky liquid", "INK", "Printing ink", "Indelible ink", "indelible ink"]}}
