A sequel is defined as a film that continues the story or expands upon the narrative of a previous film.\n\n1. **Understanding Sequels**: Sequels are films that build upon the narrative established in earlier films. Historically, sequels were less common in the Best Picture category, as many films that achieved this honor were standalone stories.\n\n2. **Notable Sequel**: \"The Godfather Part II,\" released in 1974, is a significant sequel that is often cited due to its critical acclaim and success.
