Notable examples are:\n     - **Crataegus sanguinea** (redhaw hawthorn or Siberian hawthorn) produces edible red fruits.\n     - **Crataegus monogyna** (common hawthorn) also yields edible red haws.\n     - **Crataegus erythropoda** has dark purplish-red fruits, which are also referred to as haws.\n\n2. **Fruit Characteristics**: \n   - The fruits of hawthorn trees are typically small, red, and berry-like. They are edible and can be used in various culinary applications, such as jams and jellies. The flavor of haws from **C. monogyna** has been compared to that of over-ripe apples, indicating a specific taste profile that may appeal to culinary uses.\n\n3. **Cultivation and Use**: \n   - Hawthorns are cultivated not only for their ornamental value but also for their fruits. In certain regions, particularly in the southern United States, haws from native species are used to make jellies and are considered a delicacy.
