This is a critical distinction because it affects the timeline of enrollment.\n2. **Enrollment Year**: The original reasoning states that students first enrolled in 1971, which is not supported by the passages provided. The inference drawn from the establishment year should suggest that enrollment likely began in the same year (1969) or the following year (1970).\n\n### Knowledge Enhanced Inference Process\n\nTo enhance the reasoning process, we will clarify the timeline and ensure that the conclusions drawn are consistent with the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Founding and Planning**: The Open University was founded by the Labour government under Prime Minister Harold Wilson, with planning commencing in 1965.
