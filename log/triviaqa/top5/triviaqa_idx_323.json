This relocation was not merely a change of location; it was part of Peter's broader strategy to modernize Russia and align it more closely with Western European ideals. Saint Petersburg was strategically built on the Neva River, designed to serve as a \"window to the West,\" symbolizing a new era for Russia.\n\nHowever, this decision was not permanent.

Initially, in 1712, Tsar Peter the Great moved the capital from Moscow to St. Petersburg. This decision was part of his broader efforts to modernize Russia and create a new cultural and political center that aligned more closely with Western Europe. St. Petersburg was strategically located on the Neva River and was intended to serve as a \"window to the West.\"\n\nHowever, the capital was not permanently established in St. Petersburg. In 1728, the capital was moved back to Moscow under the influence of the Supreme Privy Council. This indicates that the political landscape of Russia was dynamic, and the location of the capital was subject to change based on various influences and considerations.\n\nAdditionally, it is noted that on May 19, 1713 (May 8 in the Julian calendar), the capital was again confirmed to be in St. Petersburg. This specific date is important for historical accuracy and highlights the transitional nature of the capital during this period.\n\nOverall, the capital of Russia changed locations multiple times during the 18th century, reflecting the evolving political and cultural priorities of the Russian state.\n\n**Answer:** St. Petersburg (initially moved there in 1712, but the capital returned to Moscow in 1728)."}], "question_info": {"question": "In the 18th century, the capital of Russia was moved from Moscow to where?", "passages": ["BULLET::::- 1712 \u2013 Russian capital relocated from Moscow to Saint Petersburg.\n", "BULLET::::- 1728 - Russian capital moved back to Moscow under influence of the Supreme Privy Council.\n", "BULLET::::- May 19 (May 8 in the Julian calendar), 1713\u00a0\u2014 the capital of Russia was moved from Moscow to St.\u00a0Petersburg.\n", "BULLET::::- 1728 \u2013 State capital moves to Moscow from St. Petersburg.\n", "Following the success of the Russian Revolution of 1917, Vladimir Lenin, fearing possible foreign invasion, moved the capital from Saint Petersburg back to Moscow on March 12, 1918. \n"], "__answers__": ["St. Petersburg", "St. Petersburg", "Saint Petersburg", "Saint Petersburg", "Petersburg, Russia", "Saint Petersburg, Russia", "Petrograd", "St Petersburg", "Leningrad", "Leningrad", "Pietarissa", "saint peterburg russia", "Saint Peterburg", "Monuments of Saint Petersburg", "St. Petursburg", "\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434", "leningrad russia", "st petersburg russia", "Saint Petersberg", "Saint Petersburgh", "Sankt Petersburg", "St Petersb.", "St. petersburg", "\u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433", "St. petersbourg", "Saint-Petersburg", "Piter, Russia", "st petersberg", "st petersbourg", "petrograd", "RU-SPE", "leningrad soviet union", "\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442 \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433", "lenningrad", "un locode ruled", "st petersb", "\u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434", "leningrad", "Peter, Russia", "Saint-Peterburg", "russia st petersburg", "peterpolis", "peter russia", "ru spe", "Sankt Pieterburg", "saint petersburg russia federation", "St-Petersburg", "landscrona", "saint petersburg city", "leningrad ussr", "monuments of saint petersburg", "St petersbourg", "St. Petersberg", "UN/LOCODE:RULED", "saint petersberg", "saint peterburg", "Sankt-Petersburg", "st petersburgh", "saint petersburgh", "St Petersburg, Russia", "sankt petrburg", "St Petersberg", "Lenningrad", "Leningrad, Russia", "st petersburg", "piter russia", "Peterpolis", "Sankt-Peterburg Federal City, Russia", "pietarissa", "sankt petersburg", "St. Peterburg", "Saint Petersburg, Russia (Federation)", "peterburi", "Saint petersburg", "art pictures st petersburg", "Peterburi", "Peterburg", "Saint Petersburg City", "Sankt-Peterburg", "st petersburg russa", "St. Petersburg, Russa", "St petersburg", "sankt pieterburg", "Saint Peterburg, Russia", "Landscrona", "sankt peterburg federal city russia", "saint petersburg", "Art Pictures St. Petersburg", "St. Petersburg, Russia", "saint petersburg russia", "peterpole", "Leningrad, USSR", "sankt peterburg", "Leningrad, Soviet Union", "Sankt Peterburg", "st peterburg", "st petursburg", "Russia St. Petersburg", "Peterpole", "Saint Petersburg (Russia)", "Sankt Petrburg", "petersburg russia", "St. Petersburgh", "St.Petersburg", "peterburg"]}}
