Ecuador is located on the western side of the continent, bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the west. To the east, it shares a border with Peru, as mentioned in the question. We need to identify if there is another country that shares a border with Ecuador. \n\nLooking at a map of South America, we can see that Ecuador is bordered by Colombia to the north. Therefore, the two countries that share borders with Ecuador are Peru to the south and Colombia to the north.\n\nAnswer: Colombia\nTo update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions. \nI retrieved some knowledge that may update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions\nNote that these passages are retrieved from the most authoritative knowledge repositories, so they are assumed to be correct.\nknowledge:\nBased on the provided passages, the relevant information regarding Ecuador's borders can be extracted as follows:\n\n1. **Ecuador's Borders**: The third passage states, \"Ecuador is a republic in South America, bordered by Colombia on the north, Peru on the east and south, and by the Pacific Ocean to the west.\" This confirms that Ecuador shares a border with Colombia in addition to Peru.\n\n2. **Geographical Context**: The first and second passages focus on the Ecuador-Peru border, but they do not contradict the information about Ecuador's border with Colombia.

Lipski (1994) also considers the dialect of northern coastal Peru as a distinct variety of Spanish, based on phonetic features.\n", "Regional relations remain good despite occasional issues with neighbors, especially regarding spillover from Colombia's armed conflict, including cross-border guerrilla crossings, the flow of refugees, and the spread of drug crops. These issues are of particular concern to the bordering countries of Brazil, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. For example, Ecuador has closed its main border crossing with Colombia every night since August 2002, when evidence emerged that Colombian guerrillas and paramilitaries were asserting control over Ecuador's border communities. On May 1, 2004, Ecuador placed further stringent visa restrictions on Colombians seeking to enter Ecuador. Relations with Nicaragua and Venezuela have been strained over territorial disputes. Bilateral committees are negotiating the dispute with Venezuela over waters in the Gulf of Venezuela. Other issues with Venezuela include the presence of illegal undocumented Colombians in Venezuela, and activities of Colombian narcotics traffickers, and Venezuela's support for the Guerrillas in Colombia.\n"], "__answers__": ["Rep\u00fablica de Colombia", "Colombia", "Colombia", "Colombia", "Republic of Colombia", "rep\u00fablica de colombia", "colombia", "republic of colombia", "Etymology of Colombia", "Republica de Colombia", "colombi\u00e1", "etymology of colombia", "iso 3166 1 co", "Name of Colombia", "name of colombia", "Republic of Columbia", "republica de colombia", "Colombi\u00e1", "republic of columbia", "The Republic of Colombia", "ISO 3166-1:CO"]}}
