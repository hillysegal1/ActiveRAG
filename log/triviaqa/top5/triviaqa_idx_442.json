The model incorrectly states that Hepburn won her second Oscar for \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" (1967) and her first for \"Morning Glory\" (1933). In fact, Hepburn's first Oscar was for \"Morning Glory,\" but her second Oscar was awarded for her performance in \"The Lion in Winter\" (1968), which she shared with Barbra Streisand for \"Funny Girl.\" \n\nTo enhance the reasoning process, we can incorporate the following key points from the retrieved knowledge:\n\n1. **First Oscar Win**: Katharine Hepburn won her first Oscar for \"Morning Glory\" (1933).\n2. **Second Oscar Win**: Hepburn's second Oscar was for \"The Lion in Winter\" (1968), not \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.\" This win was significant as it marked a historical tie for the Best Actress category.\n3. **Context of Wins**: Hepburn's first Oscar win was for \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" (1967), which was the year before her second win. This establishes a clear timeline of her achievements.\n4. **Consecutive Wins**: Hepburn became the second actress to win consecutive Oscars, following Luise Rainer, highlighting her prominence in film history.\n\nBy correcting these inaccuracies and providing a clear timeline, the model can better understand the context and significance of Hepburn's Oscar wins, thus alleviating model illusions.\n\n**Answer:**\nKatharine Hepburn won her second Oscar for \"The Lion in Winter\" (1968)."}], "question_info": {"question": "For which movie did Katharine Hepburn win her second Oscar?", "passages": ["BULLET::::- Katharine Hepburn won four awards, all for Best Actress\n", "The year was notable for the first\u2014and so far, only\u2014tie for Best Actress (or any female acting category).
