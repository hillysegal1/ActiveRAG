The 1936 Summer Olympics were held in Berlin, Germany, during a time when Adolf Hitler was the Chancellor of Germany. His position as the head of state made him the most likely candidate to officially declare the games open, as is customary for the host nation's leader during such ceremonies.\n\n1. **Contextual Background**: The opening ceremony of the Olympics is a ceremonial event where the host nation formally opens the games. This is typically done by a high-ranking official, often the head of state.\n\n2. **Key Figures**: \n   - **Adolf Hitler**: As Chancellor, he played a central role in the organization of the games and was responsible for the opening declaration. Historical records confirm that he declared the games open with the phrase: \"I proclaim open the Olympic Games of Berlin, celebrating the Eleventh Olympiad of the modern era.\"\n   - **President of the German Olympic Committee**: While the passages do not name this individual, it is important to note that his speech preceded Hitler's declaration, establishing a formal context for the opening.\n\n3. **International Olympic Committee (IOC)**: The president of the IOC at that time was **Henri de Baillet-Latour**. While he was involved in the ceremony, the primary declaration of the games was made by Hitler.\n\n4. **Causal Relationships**: The sequence of events is crucial: the president of the German Olympic Committee gave a speech, which set the stage for Hitler's declaration. This illustrates a clear cause-and-effect relationship where one event leads to another, enhancing our understanding of how formal ceremonies are structured.\n\n5. **Historical Implications**: The 1936 Olympics were not just a sporting event; they were heavily influenced by the political climate of the time, particularly under Hitler's regime.

In 1936, Adolf Hitler was the Chancellor of Germany, and he played a prominent role in the organization of the games. Therefore, he would be the one to declare the games open.
