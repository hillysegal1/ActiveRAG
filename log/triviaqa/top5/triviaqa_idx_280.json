The nickname suggests a strong association with engineering, infrastructure, or significant projects that required engineering skills. \n\nOne prominent figure that comes to mind is Herbert Hoover, who served as the 31st President of the United States from 1929 to 1933. Before his presidency, Hoover was known for his work as a mining engineer and his involvement in various engineering projects. He played a crucial role in the development of infrastructure and was involved in humanitarian efforts during and after World War I.\n\nGiven this background, it is reasonable to conclude that Hoover is the president associated with the nickname \"the Great Engineer\" due to his professional background and contributions to engineering and infrastructure.\n\nAnswer:\nHerbert Hoover\nTo update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions. \nI retrieved some knowledge that may update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions\nNote that these passages are retrieved from the most authoritative knowledge repositories, so they are assumed to be correct.\nknowledge:\nBased on the provided passages, the relevant information regarding the nickname \"The Great Engineer\" pertains to Herbert Hoover, the 31st President of the United States.

The nickname implies a strong association with engineering, infrastructure, or notable humanitarian efforts.\n\nHerbert Hoover, the 31st President of the United States (1929-1933), stands out as a prominent figure linked to this nickname. Before his presidency, Hoover was a successful mining engineer and was involved in various engineering projects, which laid the foundation for his reputation in this field. His contributions to infrastructure development and humanitarian efforts during and after World War I further solidified his association with engineering.\n\nThe nickname \"The Great Engineer\" is specifically tied to Hoover's civil engineering background and his extensive work in flood control during the catastrophic Mississippi flood of 1927. Additionally, his leadership of the American Relief Administration (ARA) during the Russian famine in 1921 showcased his humanitarian commitment, which also contributed to the nickname's origin.\n\nIt is important to note that while the nickname reflects Hoover's engineering accomplishments, it was later used somewhat facetiously to highlight his perceived indifference to the economic hardships faced by many during the Great Depression. This duality in the nickname's usage underscores the complexity of Hoover's legacy.\n\nIn summary, the evidence from the retrieved passages confirms that Herbert Hoover is indeed the president associated with the nickname \"The Great Engineer,\" and it is essential to recognize both his engineering achievements and the criticisms he faced during his presidency.\n\n**Answer:**\nHerbert Hoover"}], "question_info": {"question": "Which US President was given the nickname the \u2018Great Engineer\u2019?", "passages": ["BULLET::::- The Great Engineer and The Great Humanitarian He was a civil engineer of some distinction and when the Mississippi burst its banks in 1927, engulfing thousands of acres of agricultural land, he volunteered his services and did extensive flood control work.
