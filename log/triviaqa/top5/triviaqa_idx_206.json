Craignure is a village located on the Isle of Mull in Scotland. The railway in question is known for connecting Craignure to Torosay Castle, which is also situated on the Isle of Mull. \n\nBoth locations being on the same island allows us to conclude that the narrow gauge railway operates entirely within the boundaries of the Isle of Mull. However, it is important to note that the Isle of Mull Railway, which connected these two points, closed in 2011. This closure is a significant detail that must be included in the model's knowledge to avoid any misconceptions about the railway's operational status.\n\nAdditionally, the railway's classification as a narrow gauge railway is essential for accurately understanding its characteristics. The historical context surrounding the railway's closure and the uncertainty regarding the future of the estate, including discussions about potential relocation, further enriches our understanding of the situation.\n\nIn summary, the key points to incorporate into the model's knowledge are:\n- The Isle of Mull Railway from Craignure to Torosay Castle closed in 2011.\n- It was a narrow gauge railway.\n- Both locations are on the Isle of Mull in the Scottish Inner Hebrides.\n- There was uncertainty regarding the estate's future and discussions about potential relocation of the railway.\n\nBy integrating this information, we can prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions regarding the operational status and historical context of the railway.\n\n**Answer:**\nIsle of Mull (Note: The railway is no longer operational as it closed in 2011.)"}], "question_info": {"question": "On which island does a narrow gauge railway run from Craignure to Torosay Castle?", "passages": ["The Isle of Mull Railway ran from Craignure to Torosay Castle but closed in 2011.\n", "Craignure railway station was on the now closed narrow gauge Isle of Mull Railway.\n", "Torosay Castle is a large house situated miles south of Craignure on the Isle of Mull, in the Scottish Inner Hebrides.\n", "Craignure (; ) is a village and the main ferry port on the Isle of Mull, Argyll and Bute, Scotland.
