This theory posits that the universe is eternal and unchanging on a large scale. \n\n1. **Steady-State Cosmology**: \n   - Hoyle's theory suggests that as galaxies move apart due to the expansion of the universe, new matter is continuously created to fill the gaps. This leads to the formation of new galaxies, maintaining a constant average density of matter throughout the universe. The universe, according to this model, has always looked the same at any point in time.\n\n2. **Comparison with Big Bang Theory**:\n   - Hoyle was a vocal critic of the Big Bang theory, which posits a singular beginning to the universe. He famously coined the term \"Big Bang\" during a BBC Radio broadcast in 1949, using it derisively to describe the competing theory. His steady-state model was developed to address what he perceived as shortcomings of the Big Bang, particularly the implications of a singular origin.\n\n3. **Observational Evidence**:\n   - Over time, observational evidence began to favor the Big Bang theory. Key discoveries, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) in 1964, provided strong support for the Big Bang model, leading to its acceptance as the best explanation for the origin and evolution of the universe. This shift in scientific consensus illustrates the importance of empirical evidence in validating cosmological theories.\n\n4. **Implications for Cosmology**:\n   - The steady-state theory challenges the notion of a singular beginning and suggests a universe that is always in a state of equilibrium.

This theory posits that the universe is eternal and unchanging on a large scale, with matter being continuously created to maintain a constant density as the universe expands. This means that as galaxies move apart, new matter is created in the spaces between them, leading to the formation of new galaxies.\n\n2. **Rejection of the Big Bang**: \n   - Hoyle was a vocal critic of the Big Bang theory, which suggests that the universe originated from a singular point and has been expanding ever since. He coined the term \"Big Bang\" during a BBC broadcast in 1949, initially using it derisively to describe the competing theory to his own.\n\n3. **Observational Evidence**: \n   - Despite Hoyle's steadfast support for the steady-state model, observational evidence increasingly favored the Big Bang theory. Key discoveries, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) in 1964, provided strong support for the Big Bang model, leading to its acceptance as the prevailing cosmological theory.\n\n4. **Hoyle's Contributions Beyond Cosmology**: \n   - Hoyle is also known for his work in stellar nucleosynthesis, the process by which heavier elements are formed in stars. His contributions to understanding how elements essential for life are created in the universe are significant in the field of astrophysics.\n\n5. **Cultural Impact**: \n   - In addition to his scientific work, Hoyle wrote science fiction novels and plays, which helped popularize astronomy and engage the public with scientific concepts.\n\n### Analysis of Role and Impact\n\n- **Scientific Debate**: Hoyle's steady-state theory represents a critical chapter in the history of cosmology, illustrating the scientific process of debate and the evolution of theories in light of new evidence. His rejection of the Big Bang theory highlights the importance of skepticism and the need for rigorous testing of scientific ideas.\n\n- **Impact of Observational Evidence**: The eventual acceptance of the Big Bang theory underscores the role of empirical evidence in shaping scientific consensus. Hoyle's steadfast adherence to the steady-state model, despite mounting evidence against it, serves as a reminder of how personal beliefs can influence scientific interpretation.\n\n- **Interdisciplinary Influence**: Hoyle's work in both science and fiction demonstrates the interplay between scientific inquiry and cultural representation. His novels not only entertained but also educated readers about complex scientific ideas, bridging the gap between academia and the public.\n\n- **Legacy in Cosmology**: Hoyle's contributions to the understanding of nucleosynthesis and his theories about the universe's structure have left a lasting legacy in astrophysics. Even though the steady-state theory is no longer widely accepted, it has contributed to the discourse on the nature of the universe and has influenced subsequent theories.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe information extracted from the passages deepens the understanding of Sir Fred Hoyle's steady-state theory and its context within the broader field of cosmology. It highlights the dynamic nature of scientific theories, the importance of observational evidence, and the cultural impact of scientific ideas.

This means that as galaxies move apart, new matter is created in the spaces between them, leading to the formation of new galaxies.\n\n2. **Rejection of the Big Bang**: \n   - Hoyle was a vocal critic of the Big Bang theory, which suggests that the universe originated from a singular point and has been expanding ever since. He coined the term \"Big Bang\" during a BBC broadcast in 1949, initially using it derisively to describe the competing theory to his own.\n\n3. **Observational Evidence**: \n   - Despite Hoyle's steadfast support for the steady-state model, observational evidence increasingly favored the Big Bang theory. Key discoveries, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) in 1964, provided strong support for the Big Bang model, leading to its acceptance as the prevailing cosmological theory.\n\n4. **Hoyle's Contributions Beyond Cosmology**: \n   - Hoyle is also known for his work in stellar nucleosynthesis, the process by which heavier elements are formed in stars. His contributions to understanding how elements essential for life are created in the universe are significant in the field of astrophysics.\n\n5. **Cultural Impact**: \n   - In addition to his scientific work, Hoyle wrote science fiction novels and plays, which helped popularize astronomy and engage the public with scientific concepts.\n\n### Analysis of Role and Impact\n\n- **Scientific Debate**: Hoyle's steady-state theory represents a critical chapter in the history of cosmology, illustrating the scientific process of debate and the evolution of theories in light of new evidence. His rejection of the Big Bang theory highlights the importance of skepticism and the need for rigorous testing of scientific ideas.\n\n- **Impact of Observational Evidence**: The eventual acceptance of the Big Bang theory underscores the role of empirical evidence in shaping scientific consensus. Hoyle's steadfast adherence to the steady-state model, despite mounting evidence against it, serves as a reminder of how personal beliefs can influence scientific interpretation.\n\n- **Interdisciplinary Influence**: Hoyle's work in both science and fiction demonstrates the interplay between scientific inquiry and cultural representation. His novels not only entertained but also educated readers about complex scientific ideas, bridging the gap between academia and the public.\n\n- **Legacy in Cosmology**: Hoyle's contributions to the understanding of nucleosynthesis and his theories about the universe's structure have left a lasting legacy in astrophysics. Even though the steady-state theory is no longer widely accepted, it has contributed to the discourse on the nature of the universe and has influenced subsequent theories.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe information extracted from the passages deepens the understanding of Sir Fred Hoyle's steady-state theory and its context within the broader field of cosmology. It highlights the dynamic nature of scientific theories, the importance of observational evidence, and the cultural impact of scientific ideas.

He then proposed a theory of the history of the universe known as steady-state cosmology, which has the universe existing forever without an initial Big Bang (as Hoyle derisively dubbed it). He held his belief in the steady state long after observations proved that the Big Bang had happened.\\n', 'After World War II, two distinct possibilities emerged. One was Fred Hoyle\\'s steady state model, whereby new matter would be created as the universe seemed to expand. In this model the universe is roughly the same at any point in time. The other was Lema\u00eetre\\'s Big Bang theory, advocated and developed by George Gamow, who introduced Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and whose associates, Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman, predicted the CMB. Ironically, it was Hoyle who coined the phrase that came to be applied to Lema\u00eetre\\'s theory, referring to it as \"this \"big bang\" idea\" during a BBC Radio broadcast in March 1949. For a while, support was split between these two theories. Eventually, the observational evidence, most notably from radio source counts, began to favor Big Bang over Steady State. The discovery and confirmation of the CMB in 1964 secured the Big Bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the universe. Much of the current work in cosmology includes understanding how galaxies form in the context of the Big Bang, understanding the physics of the universe at earlier and earlier times, and reconciling observations with the basic theory.\\n', 'Fred Hoyle was an astronomer best known for his work on the understanding of the creation of the elements through stellar nucleosynthesis, for developing the steady state theory of the universe and for coining the term \"Big Bang\" for the steady state theory\\'s rival dynamic evolving model of the universe. Hoyle also had a taste for science fiction, having written a novel, \"The Black Cloud\" (1957), about a cloud of interstellar gas that threatens the Earth; this was adapted for radio and broadcast on 14 December 1957 by the BBC Home Service. The BBC were also interested in adapting \"The Black Cloud\" for television but Hoyle had already signed away the movie rights. Hoyle followed \"The Black Cloud\" with another science fiction novel, \"Ossian\\'s Ride\" (1958); this attracted the interest of Norman James, a BBC designer keen to move into television production, who contacted Hoyle with a view to obtaining the rights to the novel. In discussion with the writer, James learned that Hoyle was interested in writing an original story for television. James contacted John Elliot, the assistant head of the BBC Script Department, who was interested in making a science fiction serial. Elliot, along with James and BBC script editor Donald Bull, met with Hoyle who outlined a potential story for an eight-part serial; this was what would eventually become \"A for Andromeda\". Hoyle drew his inspiration for the serial from the work of astronomer Frank Drake who at that time had begun \"Project Ozma\", one of the first experiments in the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI). In late June 1960, the BBC made an offer of 250 guineas to Hoyle for the idea, which would be dramatised for television, as a serial in seven 30-minute parts, by John Elliot. Hoyle replied, \"It has seemed to me that the overall sum of 250 gns is unsatisfactorily low. My own computations would suggest 1000 gns.

He then proposed a theory of the history of the universe known as steady-state cosmology, which has the universe existing forever without an initial Big Bang (as Hoyle derisively dubbed it). He held his belief in the steady state long after observations proved that the Big Bang had happened.\n", "After World War II, two distinct possibilities emerged. One was Fred Hoyle's steady state model, whereby new matter would be created as the universe seemed to expand. In this model the universe is roughly the same at any point in time. The other was Lema\u00eetre's Big Bang theory, advocated and developed by George Gamow, who introduced Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and whose associates, Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman, predicted the CMB. Ironically, it was Hoyle who coined the phrase that came to be applied to Lema\u00eetre's theory, referring to it as \"this \"big bang\" idea\" during a BBC Radio broadcast in March 1949. For a while, support was split between these two theories. Eventually, the observational evidence, most notably from radio source counts, began to favor Big Bang over Steady State. The discovery and confirmation of the CMB in 1964 secured the Big Bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the universe. Much of the current work in cosmology includes understanding how galaxies form in the context of the Big Bang, understanding the physics of the universe at earlier and earlier times, and reconciling observations with the basic theory.\n", "Fred Hoyle was an astronomer best known for his work on the understanding of the creation of the elements through stellar nucleosynthesis, for developing the steady state theory of the universe and for coining the term \"Big Bang\" for the steady state theory's rival dynamic evolving model of the universe. Hoyle also had a taste for science fiction, having written a novel, \"The Black Cloud\" (1957), about a cloud of interstellar gas that threatens the Earth; this was adapted for radio and broadcast on 14 December 1957 by the BBC Home Service. The BBC were also interested in adapting \"The Black Cloud\" for television but Hoyle had already signed away the movie rights. Hoyle followed \"The Black Cloud\" with another science fiction novel, \"Ossian's Ride\" (1958); this attracted the interest of Norman James, a BBC designer keen to move into television production, who contacted Hoyle with a view to obtaining the rights to the novel. In discussion with the writer, James learned that Hoyle was interested in writing an original story for television. James contacted John Elliot, the assistant head of the BBC Script Department, who was interested in making a science fiction serial. Elliot, along with James and BBC script editor Donald Bull, met with Hoyle who outlined a potential story for an eight-part serial; this was what would eventually become \"A for Andromeda\". Hoyle drew his inspiration for the serial from the work of astronomer Frank Drake who at that time had begun \"Project Ozma\", one of the first experiments in the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI). In late June 1960, the BBC made an offer of 250 guineas to Hoyle for the idea, which would be dramatised for television, as a serial in seven 30-minute parts, by John Elliot. Hoyle replied, \"It has seemed to me that the overall sum of 250 gns is unsatisfactorily low. My own computations would suggest 1000 gns. I estimate that such a sum would still be only 2\u20133 percent of the receipts by the BBC from licences. Such a percentage still seems low \u2013 it is considerably less than rates available in the US\".Mitton, \"Conflict in the Cosmos\", p.\u00a0254. Eventually, a fee of 700 guineas was agreed. Elliot delivered his draft scripts between March and April 1961; at this point it was decided that each episode should run for 45 minutes and so Elliot had to work to expand each script.\n", "In 1958, Hoyle was Plumian professor of astronomy at Cambridge and engaged in the study of the structure and evolution of the stars. Even though he coined the phrase \u201cBig Bang,\u201d Hoyle rejected the \u2018big bang\u2019 theory of the origin of the universe in favor of the steady state theory, which claimed that the universe has always looked as it does now. Martin Ryle, however, held to the big bang theory for the creation of the universe in a moment, the theory that eventually held sway. Some of Hoyle's writings, including science fiction and plays, popularized astronomy. Christopher H. Derrick of Geoffrey Bles publishers, presumably in 1963 and before Lewis's death, wrote a proposal for a book that was to include \u201cReligion and Rocketry,\u201d stating that \u201cThis essay seems to have been written in rebuttal of an argument which is only likely to be brought forward by a rather silly minority (though an academically distinguished one)\u2026\u201d Hoyle would have been part of that academically distinguished, but silly, minority.\n", "Sir Fred Hoyle FRS (24 June 1915\u00a0\u2013 20 August 2001) was an English astronomer who formulated the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis. He also held controversial stances on other scientific matters\u2014in particular his rejection of the \"Big Bang\" theory, a term coined by him on BBC radio, and his promotion of panspermia as the origin of life on Earth.

Menzel Professor Emeritus of Astronomy at Harvard University. He is known for his cosmological theory of the expansion of the universe, which postulates that its order and information are increasing despite the second law of thermodynamics. He is also known for being one of the most notable researchers who advocated for a Cold Big Bang theory. When he proposed this theory in 1966, he suggested it would solve Olbers' paradox, which holds that the night sky on Earth should be much brighter than it actually is. He also published several articles critiquing hereditarian views on human intelligence, such as those of Richard Herrnstein and Arthur Jensen. He has been a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1963, and is also a member of Divisions B and J of the International Astronomical Union.\n", "Inspired by the Machian nature of the Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory for electrodynamics, Fred Hoyle and Jayant Narlikar proposed their own theory of gravity in the context of general relativity. This model still exists in spite of recent astronomical observations that have challenged the theory. Stephen Hawking had criticized the original Hoyle-Narlikar theory believing that the advanced waves going off to infinity would lead to a divergence, as indeed they would, if the universe were only expanding. However, as emphasized in the revised version of the Hoyle-Narlikar theory devoid of the \"Creation Field\" (generating matter out of empty space) known as the Gravitational absorber theory, the universe is also accelerating in that expansion. The acceleration leads to a horizon type cutoff and hence no divergence. Gravitational absorber theory has been used to explain the mass fluctuations in the Woodward effect (see section on Woodward effect below).\n", "In 2003, Peter Lynds has put forward a new cosmology model in which time is cyclic. In his theory our Universe will eventually stop expanding and then contract. Before becoming a singularity, as one would expect from Hawking's black hole theory, the universe would bounce. Lynds claims that a singularity would violate the second law of thermodynamics and this stops the universe from being bounded by singularities. The Big Crunch would be avoided with a new Big Bang. Lynds suggests the exact history of the universe would be repeated in each cycle in an eternal recurrence. Some critics argue that while the universe may be cyclic, the histories would all be variants. Lynds' theory has been dismissed by mainstream physicists for the lack of a mathematical model behind its philosophical considerations.\n"], "__answers__": ["Steady-state", "Steady State", "Steady State", "steady state concentration", "steady state condition", "Steady state concentration", "Steady State (Thermodynamics)", "Steady state", "steady state", "Steady-state condition", "steady state thermodynamics"]}}
