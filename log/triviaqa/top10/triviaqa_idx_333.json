Still, while contemporaneous illustrators portrayed Holmes as wearing a deerstalker in the proper setting for such attire, travelling cross-country or operating in a rural outdoor setting, Sidney Paget chose to depict Holmes as wearing the deerstalker in London while keeping vigil for the appearance of the murderous Colonel Sebastian Moran in illustrations made for \"The Empty House\" when the story first appeared in \"Strand Magazine\" in 1904. This is uncharacteristic of Paget who most often depicts Holmes wearing a black top hat and frock coat in the city, as shown in the Regent Street scene in \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\", or sporting a black bowler when wearing a black or plaid Inverness cape (or, more accurately, a macfarlane cape-coat) as seen in his illustrations for \"The Blue Carbuncle\" and \"The Musgrave Ritual\" respectively.\\n', \"Arguably the most famous example in fiction, Arthur Conan Doyle's famous detective Sherlock Holmes is often associated with the Inverness cape.

As the deerstalker is the most typical cap of the period matching both descriptions, it is not surprising that the original illustrations for the stories by Sidney Paget (who favored a deerstalker himself) in Great Britain, and Frederic Dorr Steele in the United States, along with other illustrators of the period, depicted Holmes as a \"deerstalker man\", which then became the popular perception of him.\\n', 'The deerstalker is a type of hat associated with Sherlock Holmes and Elmer Fudd.

It is not appropriate headgear for the properly dressed urban gentleman. Still, while contemporaneous illustrators portrayed Holmes as wearing a deerstalker in the proper setting for such attire, travelling cross-country or operating in a rural outdoor setting, Sidney Paget chose to depict Holmes as wearing the deerstalker in London while keeping vigil for the appearance of the murderous Colonel Sebastian Moran in illustrations made for \"The Empty House\" when the story first appeared in \"Strand Magazine\" in 1904. This is uncharacteristic of Paget who most often depicts Holmes wearing a black top hat and frock coat in the city, as shown in the Regent Street scene in \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\", or sporting a black bowler when wearing a black or plaid Inverness cape (or, more accurately, a macfarlane cape-coat) as seen in his illustrations for \"The Blue Carbuncle\" and \"The Musgrave Ritual\" respectively.\n", "Arguably the most famous example in fiction, Arthur Conan Doyle's famous detective Sherlock Holmes is often associated with the Inverness cape. In the Holmes novels, Holmes is described as wearing an Ulster. Holmes's distinctive look, which was usually complemented with a deerstalker cap and a calabash pipe, is a composite of images, originally credited to illustrator Sidney Paget. But as adapted to the stage by the actor-playwright William Gillette, Holmes did not wear a cape-coat at all, and the origin of the calabash pipe is something of a mystery, although it might have had something to do with Gillette's introduction of a full-bend briar pipe for his performances. Paget had depicted Holmes as smoking straight pipes, exclusively.\n", "The most famous wearer of a deerstalker is undoubtedly the fictional character Sherlock Holmes, who is popularly depicted favouring this style of cap. Holmes is never actually described as wearing a deerstalker by name in Arthur Conan Doyle's stories, though. However, most notably in \"The Adventure of Silver Blaze\", the narrator, Doctor Watson, describes him as wearing \"his ear-flapped travelling cap\", and in \"The Boscombe Valley Mystery\", as wearing a \"close-fitting cloth cap\". As the deerstalker is the most typical cap of the period matching both descriptions, it is not surprising that the original illustrations for the stories by Sidney Paget (who favored a deerstalker himself) in Great Britain, and Frederic Dorr Steele in the United States, along with other illustrators of the period, depicted Holmes as a \"deerstalker man\", which then became the popular perception of him.\n", "The deerstalker is a type of hat associated with Sherlock Holmes and Elmer Fudd. Notable for its slight rain-brim to the front and back, with a camouflage checked twill pattern and fold-down earpieces for selective warmth or to raise when listening for deer.\n", "Trying to prevent anyone, specifically the press, from getting a photograph of his face, Sherlock disguises it with a modern cap styled after a classic deerstalker. This becomes his trademark\u2014much to his annoyance as he greatly dislikes the hat, describing it in The Reichenbach Fall as a \"death Frisbee\" and expressing confusion about the advantage this hat, according to its name, would provide to a person hunting deer. He concludes that as this hat has ear flaps, it is an \"ear hat.\" However, he seems to have accepted the fact that the hat is now his trademark since he puts one on before greeting the press about his miraculous return in The Empty Hearse. Sherlock is also shown not to enjoy eating; in \"The Blind Banker\", he explains to Molly Hooper that he doesn't eat while he's working, as digesting slows him down. In the pilot episode of the show, he tells John that he does not eat every day, and later in the episode, John uses the fact that Sherlock has not eaten in several days to convince Lestrade to allow Sherlock to leave the scene of the cabbie Jeff Hope's death \u2013 in order to go and eat dinner \u2013 instead of staying to share his deductions with the police force.\n", "It has been supposed that Holmes' indiscriminate use of the deerstalker cap occurred because of the popularity of the two period films from 1939 in which Basil Rathbone starred as Holmes, \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" and \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\". This is erroneous. In both of these films Holmes is shown properly wearing the deerstalker in the countryside or in a rural setting.\n", "Tweed was worn by many fictional characters from the Victorian and Edwardian periods, including the detective Sherlock Holmes. Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett both wore keeper's tweed deerstalkers and Inverness capes, but more recent portrayals of Sherlock have abandoned the hat. Although Robert Downey Jr.'s character wore a fedora, both he and Doctor Watson wore tweed overcoats, as was then fashionable in Victorian England. Due to the popularity of Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of \"Sherlock\", the tweed overcoat entered high fashion in the 2010s.\n", "Brass goggles have become a trademark for steampunk fashion. Brass items are also a kind of official, standard steampunk accessory. Goggles with intricate patterns on large, round frames are the most commonly used ones. Hats in steampunk fashion may include all kinds of headgear like flight helmets, bowler hats, pith helmets and pirates' bandanas. The headgear in steampunk fashion is also inspired by Victorian era fashion styles. Among those, the deerstalker hat that Sherlock Holmes, the noted character in Arthur Conan Doyle's novels, was depicted wearing in Sidney Paget's illustrations of the novel.\n", "The actor most associated with Holmes on stage was William Gillette, who wrote, directed, and starred in a popular play entitled \"Sherlock Holmes\" in seven different productions on Broadway from 1899 (filmed in 1916), while the stories were still being published, to 1930. His version of Holmes, dressed in deerstalker hat and Inverness cape and smoking a large curved calabash pipe, contributed much to the popular image of the character. The deerstalker hat appears occasionally in Paget's original illustrations for \"The Strand\", but it is by no means a part of Holmes' regular clothing. Doyle's text is even vaguer, referring only to a travelling cap with earflaps in the passages with the relevant illustrations. He is also described as smoking several different types of pipes, varying them with his mood.\n"], "__answers__": ["Deerstalker", "Deerstalkers", "Deerstalker Hat", "Deerstalker cap", "deerstalker hats", "deer stalker cap", "deerstalker cap", "Deer stalker caps", "Deer stalkers", "deer stalker hats", "Deer stalker hat", "deerstalker hat", "Deerstalker hats", "Deer-stalker hats", "deerstlaker", "Deer-stalker cap", "deer stalker caps", "Deer stalker", "deerstalker", "Deer stalker hats", "Deer-stalker caps", "deerstalkers", "deer stalker", "Deer-stalkers", "deer stalkers", "Deer-stalker hat", "Deerstlaker", "Deerstalker hat", "Deer-stalker", "Deer stalker cap", "deer stalker hat", "deerstalker caps", "Deerstalker caps"]}}
