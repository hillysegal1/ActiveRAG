The Wimbledon Championships have a rich history, and while many players from various countries have won, we specifically focus on those born in England.\n\n1. **Identifying Key Players**: The passages indicate that Fred Perry is recognized as the last Englishman to win the men's singles title at Wimbledon, achieving this in 1936. This establishes Perry as a significant figure in the context of English tennis history.\n\n2. **Clarifying National Identity**: Andy Murray, who won the title in 2013 and again in 2016, is often mentioned in discussions about British tennis success. However, it is crucial to note that he was born in Scotland. While he represents Great Britain in international competitions, he does not qualify as an English-born player. This distinction is vital for accurately answering the question.\n\n3. **Temporal Context**: The timeline is important. The gap between Perry's victory in 1936 and Murray's wins in 2013 and 2016 highlights a long period without an English-born champion. This context emphasizes the significance of Perry's achievement and the rarity of English success in the tournament.\n\n4. **Causal Relationships**: The information establishes a causal relationship between the achievements of these players and their national identities. Perry's win in 1936 set a benchmark for English tennis, and the subsequent lack of English champions until Murray's victories (which do not count for this specific question) underscores the historical importance of Perry's legacy.\n\n5. **Historical Significance**: The passages also mention the broader context of British players' success at Wimbledon, noting that there has been a lack of English-born winners since Perry.
