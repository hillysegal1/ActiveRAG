The Catskills are recognized as a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian Mountains, indicating their significance within the broader mountain range system.\n\nAdditionally, the Catskills are culturally and geographically defined by their proximity to Catskill Park, a protected forest preserve under New York state law. This legal protection highlights the importance of conservation in the region and adds depth to the understanding of the Catskills as a destination for outdoor activities and tourism.\n\nThe Catskill Mountains span several counties, including Delaware, Greene, Schoharie, Sullivan, and Ulster. There are also areas that extend into southwestern Albany, eastern Broome, northwestern Orange, and southern Otsego counties. This detailed county information is crucial for accurately identifying the geographical boundaries of the Catskills.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of foothills in southeastern Chenango, southern Montgomery, northern Otsego, and western Schenectady counties provides additional context about the surrounding terrain, enhancing the model's understanding of the region's geography.\n\nBy integrating this comprehensive information, the model can achieve a more accurate representation of the Catskill Mountains, thereby reducing the likelihood of factual errors and addressing potential model illusions related to geographic knowledge.\n\n**Answer:**\nNew York"}], "question_info": {"question": "In which US state are the Catskill Mountains?", "passages": ["The Catskill Mountains, also known as the Catskills, are a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian Mountains, located in southeastern New York.
