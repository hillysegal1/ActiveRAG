To arrive at the correct answer, I will analyze the context and historical background of the statue, as well as its reception by the public.\n\n1. **Historical Context**: The statue was unveiled on June 29, 1893, and was met with criticism regarding its design and location. This suggests that the statue's reception was contentious, which may have influenced how it is referred to in popular culture.\n\n2. **Renaming and Public Perception**: The statue was renamed 'The Angel of Christian Charity' as a Christian interpretation of the Greek god Anteros. However, this name did not gain widespread acceptance. Instead, the statue is more commonly known as \"Eros,\" which reflects its sensual design and the public's perception of it as a representation of love, rather than charity.\n\n3. **Cultural Significance**: The name \"Eros\" carries connotations of sensuality and love, which contrasts with the intended memorialization of a sober Earl. This irony may have contributed to the statue's enduring nickname, as it resonates more with the character of the neighborhood in which it is located.\n\n4. **Causal Relationships**: The initial complaints about the statue's design and location led to a renaming attempt, which ultimately failed to change public perception. This illustrates a causal relationship between public reception and the naming of public art, highlighting how societal values can shape the interpretation of monuments.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the historical context, public reception, and the irony of the statue's common name, it is clear that the statue 'The Angel of Christian Charity' is more commonly known as \"Eros.\"\n\n### Answer:\nThe Angel of Charity is more commonly known as \"Eros.\""}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nHow is the London statue 'The Angel of Christian Charity' more commonly known?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The memorial was unveiled by the Duke of Westminster on 29 June 1893.
