The aperture controls the amount of light that enters the camera, which directly influences exposure (how bright or dark an image is) and depth of field (the range of distance within a photo that appears acceptably sharp). A lower F stop number (e.g., f/2.8) allows more light in and results in a shallower depth of field, while a higher F stop number (e.g., f/16) allows less light in and increases the depth of field.\n\n**Relevant Professions:**\n1. **Photographers**: The most obvious profession requiring knowledge of F stops is photography. Photographers must understand how to manipulate F stops to achieve desired artistic effects, control exposure, and create images with the appropriate depth of field.\n  \n2. **Cinematographers**: Similar to photographers, cinematographers (who work in film and video) also need to understand F stops to control lighting and focus in moving images.\n\n3. **Forensic Artists**: While the passage on forensic artists does not explicitly mention photography, these artists often utilize photographic techniques to create accurate representations of subjects for legal purposes. Understanding F stops can help them capture clear and detailed images, which are essential for their work.\n\n4. **Visual Artists**: Many visual artists who incorporate photography into their work or use photographic references would benefit from knowledge of F stops.
