As result of sudden attack on Port Arthur, two Russian battleships were seriosly damaged by Tropedoes. This attack developed into a full-scale battle known as Siege of Port Arthur the next morning. Several attempts by Japanese Navy to attack Russian fleets were failed due to coastal artillery fire and the reluctance of the Russian fleet to leave the harbor for battle on the high seas, especially after the death of Admiral S. Makarov on April 13, 1904.\\n', 'On the night of 8 February 1904, the Japanese naval fleet under Admiral Heihachiro Togo opened the war with a surprise attack by torpedo boat destroyers on the Russian ships at Port Arthur, badly damaging two Russian battleships. The attacks developed into the Battle of Port Arthur the next morning. A series of indecisive naval engagements followed, in which the Japanese were unable to attack the Russian fleet successfully under shore batteries (\"coastal guns\") of the harbor and the Russians declined to leave the harbor for the open seas, especially after the death of Admiral Stepan Osipovich Makarov on 13 April 1904.\\n', 'On the night of 8 February 1904, the Japanese fleet under Admiral T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d opened the war with a surprise torpedo boat destroyer attack on the Russian ships at Port Arthur. The attack heavily damaged the \"Tsesarevich\" and \"Retvizan\", the heaviest battleships in Russia\\'s far Eastern theater, and the 6,600\\xa0ton cruiser \"Pallada\". These attacks developed into the Battle of Port Arthur the next morning. A series of indecisive naval engagements followed, in which Admiral T\u014dg\u014d was unable to attack the Russian fleet successfully as it was protected by the shore batteries of the harbour, and the Russians were reluctant to leave the harbour for the open seas, especially after the death of Admiral Stepan Osipovich Makarov on 13 April 1904. Although the actual Battle of Port Arthur was indecisive, the initial attacks had a devastating psychological effect on Russia, which had been confident about the prospect of war. The Japanese had seized the initiative while the Russians waited in port.\\n', 'At about 22:30 on Monday 8 February 1904, the Port Arthur attack squadron of 10 destroyers encountered patrolling Russian destroyers. The Russians were under orders not to initiate combat, and turned to report the contact to headquarters. However, as a result of the encounter, two Japanese destroyers collided and fell behind and the remainder became scattered. At circa 00:28 on 9 February, the first four Japanese destroyers approached the port of Port Arthur without being observed, and launched a torpedo attack against the \"Pallada\" (which was hit amidship, caught fire, and keeled over) and the \"Retvizan\" (which was holed in her bow). The other Japanese destroyers were less successful; many of the torpedoes became caught in the extended torpedo nets which effectively prevented most of the torpedoes from striking the vitals of the Russian battleships. Other destroyers had arrived too late to benefit from surprise, and made their attacks individually rather than in a group. However, they were able to disable the most powerful ship of the Russian fleet, the battleship \"Tsesarevich\". The Japanese destroyer \"Oboro\" made the last attack, around 02:00, by which time the Russians were fully awake, and their searchlights and gunfire made accurate and close range torpedo attacks impossible.\\n', 'On Tuesday 8 March 1904, Russian Admiral Stepan Makarov arrived in Port Arthur to assume command from the unfortunate Admiral Stark, thus raising Russian morale. He raised his flag on the newly repaired \"Askold\". On the morning of Thursday 10 March 1904, the Russian fleet took to the offensive, and attacked the blockading Japanese squadron, but to little effect. In the evening of 10 March 1904, the Japanese attempted a ruse by sending four destroyers close to the harbor. The Russians took the bait, and sent out six destroyers in pursuit; whereupon the Japanese mined the entrance to the harbor and moved into position to block the destroyers\\' return. Two of the Russian destroyers were sunk, despite efforts by Admiral Makarov to come to their rescue.\\n', 'The Russian fleet attempted to break out from Port Arthur and proceed to Vladivostok, but they were intercepted and dispersed at the Battle of the Yellow Sea. The remnant of the Russian fleet remained in Port Arthur, where the ships were slowly sunk by the artillery of the besieging army. Attempts to relieve the city by land also failed, and after the Battle of Liaoyang in late August, the Russians retreated to Mukden (Shenyang). Port Arthur finally fell on 2 January 1905, after a series of brutal, high-casualty assaults.\\n', 'At 10:30 on December 5, following another massive artillery bombardment, the Japanese managed to overrun 203 Meter Hill overlooking the harbour of Port Arthur with the Russian Pacific Fleet at anchor. They sent an artillery observer on the hill, directing the fire of the 28\\xa0cm howitzer, systematically sinking the Russian fleet, one ship after another. On December 5, 1904, the battleship \"Poltava\" was sunk, followed by the battleship \"Retvizan\" on December 7, 1904, the battleships \"Pobeda\" and \"Peresvet\" and the cruisers \"Pallada\" and \"Bayan\" on December 9, 1904. All six would be raised, repaired, renamed, and recommissioned by the Japanese after the war. The battleship \"Sevastopol\", although hit five times by shells, managed to move out of range of the guns. On the night of January 2, 1905, after Port Arthur surrendered, Captain Nikolai Essen of the \"Sevastopol\" had the crippled battleship scuttled in of water by opening the sea cocks on one side, so that the ship would sink on its side and could not be raised and salvaged by the Japanese.\\n', 'During the Russo-Japanese War the Japanese Third Army was besieging Port Arthur. While the capture of Port Arthur had been achieved in a single assault during the First Sino-Japanese War the situation was different in 1904. The Russians had been in possession of Port Arthur since 1897 and had constructed strong fortifications around the city following the plans of General Eduard Totleben. After the first general assault in August 1904 and over 16,000 casualties General Nogi, the commanding officer of the Japanese forces, requested heavy siege guns. With the arrival of the first battery of 28\\xa0cm howitzers, replacing those lost when the transport \"Hitachi Maru\", loaded with a battalion of the First Reserve Regiment of the Guards, was sunk by Russian cruisers in the Hitachi Maru Incident on June 15, 1904, the situation changed. The massive, 11-inch, howitzers could throw a 217\\xa0kilogram (478\\xa0pound) shell over 7.8 kilometers (4.8\\xa0miles), and Nogi then had the firepower necessary to make a serious attempt against the Russian fortifications. The huge shells were nicknamed \"roaring trains\" by the Russian troops (for the sound they made just before impact), and during their period at Port Arthur over 16,949 of these shells were fired.\\n', 'When the Russo-Japanese War broke out in 1904, \"Rurik\" and the other cruisers of the Pacific Squadron, , , and , were all charged with seeking out and destroying Japanese merchant vessels in the Sea of Japan and along the coasts of the Japanese home islands. By August 1904, only one ship had been sunk and the Imperial Japanese Army had moved siege artillery close enough to shell the main Russian port in the Pacific, Port Arthur. The siege of Port Arthur kept most of the Russian naval vessels assigned to the Pacific Squadron inside the port, despite several failed attempts at breakout.\\n', 'During the war the bulk of the Russian Pacific Fleet was located in Port Arthur where they were blockaded by the Japanese. On 10 August 1904 the ships at Port Arthur attempted breakout to Vladivostok, but were turned back in the Battle of the Yellow Sea. Admiral Jessen was ordered to rendezvous with them, but the order was delayed and his ships had to raise steam, so he did not sortie until the evening of 13 August. \"Bogatyr\" had been damaged earlier when she grounded and did not sail with the squadron. By dawn he had reached the island of Tsushima in the Tsushima Strait between Korea and Japan. He turned back for Vladivostok when he failed to see any ships from the Port Arthur squadron. north of the island he encountered the Japanese squadron commanded by Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonoj\u014d tasked to patrol the Tsushima Strait. The Japanese force had four modern armored cruisers, , , , and . The two squadrons had passed during the night without spotting the other and each had reversed course around first light.

Here\u2019s a summary and analysis of the key points that deepen understanding of the question regarding which navy destroyed the Russian fleet at Port Arthur:\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Japanese Navy's Initial Attack**:\n   - The Japanese Navy, under Admiral T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d, launched a surprise attack on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur on the night of February 8, 1904. This attack involved torpedo boat destroyers and resulted in significant damage to two Russian battleships, the \"Tsesarevich\" and \"Retvizan,\" as well as the cruiser \"Pallada.\"\n\n2. **Battle of Port Arthur**:\n   - The initial attacks developed into a series of naval engagements known as the Battle of Port Arthur. Despite the Japanese Navy's efforts, the engagements were largely indecisive due to the strong coastal artillery defending the harbor and the Russian fleet's reluctance to engage in open sea battles.\n\n3. **Psychological Impact**:\n   - The Japanese attacks had a profound psychological effect on Russia, which had been confident in its naval capabilities. The Japanese seized the initiative early in the conflict, which shifted the dynamics of the war.\n\n4. **Siege and Attrition**:\n   - The siege of Port Arthur continued throughout 1904, with the Japanese army besieging the port and gradually wearing down the Russian defenses. The Russian fleet remained largely trapped, leading to a slow attrition of their naval power.\n\n5. **Final Destruction of the Fleet**:\n   - The culmination of the siege occurred on December 5, 1904, when Japanese forces managed to systematically sink the remaining Russian ships in Port Arthur through artillery bombardment. This included the sinking of several battleships and cruisers, marking the effective destruction of the Russian fleet at this location.\n\n6. **Aftermath**:\n   - The fall of Port Arthur on January 2, 1905, represented a significant victory for Japan in the Russo-Japanese War, demonstrating Japan's rising military power and marking a shift in naval warfare dynamics.\n\n### Analysis of Role and Impact:\n\n- **Military Strategy**: The passages illustrate the strategic importance of Port Arthur as a naval base and the implications of its capture for both the Japanese and Russian navies.

This event is closely associated with the Russo-Japanese War, which took place between 1904 and 1905. The war was primarily fought between the Russian Empire and the Empire of Japan over rival imperial ambitions in Manchuria and Korea.\n\nDuring this conflict, the Japanese navy conducted several successful attacks against the Russian fleet stationed at Port Arthur, which was a significant naval base for Russia in the Far East. The Japanese navy's strategic and tactical superiority, along with their surprise attacks, led to the eventual destruction of the Russian fleet.\n\nTherefore, the country whose navy destroyed the Russian fleet at Port Arthur is Japan.\n\nAnswer:\nJapan\nTo deepen the language model's understanding of the question through familiarity with basic and advanced pieces of information.\nEncourage the language model to comprehend the question more thoroughly and expand its knowledge boundaries.\nI retrieved some foundational knowledge that is familiar to the model or advanced information beyond the language model's already familiar foundational knowledge from these passages. \nknowledge:\nThe passages provided detail the events surrounding the naval engagements between Japan and Russia during the Russo-Japanese War, particularly focusing on the attacks on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur in 1904 and 1905. Here\u2019s a summary and analysis of the key points that deepen understanding of the question regarding which navy destroyed the Russian fleet at Port Arthur:\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Japanese Navy's Initial Attack**:\n   - The Japanese Navy, under Admiral T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d, launched a surprise attack on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur on the night of February 8, 1904. This attack involved torpedo boat destroyers and resulted in significant damage to two Russian battleships, the \"Tsesarevich\" and \"Retvizan,\" as well as the cruiser \"Pallada.\"\n\n2. **Battle of Port Arthur**:\n   - The initial attacks developed into a series of naval engagements known as the Battle of Port Arthur. Despite the Japanese Navy's efforts, the engagements were largely indecisive due to the strong coastal artillery defending the harbor and the Russian fleet's reluctance to engage in open sea battles.\n\n3. **Psychological Impact**:\n   - The Japanese attacks had a profound psychological effect on Russia, which had been confident in its naval capabilities. The Japanese seized the initiative early in the conflict, which shifted the dynamics of the war.\n\n4. **Siege and Attrition**:\n   - The siege of Port Arthur continued throughout 1904, with the Japanese army besieging the port and gradually wearing down the Russian defenses. The Russian fleet remained largely trapped, leading to a slow attrition of their naval power.\n\n5. **Final Destruction of the Fleet**:\n   - The culmination of the siege occurred on December 5, 1904, when Japanese forces managed to systematically sink the remaining Russian ships in Port Arthur through artillery bombardment. This included the sinking of several battleships and cruisers, marking the effective destruction of the Russian fleet at this location.\n\n6. **Aftermath**:\n   - The fall of Port Arthur on January 2, 1905, represented a significant victory for Japan in the Russo-Japanese War, demonstrating Japan's rising military power and marking a shift in naval warfare dynamics.\n\n### Analysis of Role and Impact:\n\n- **Military Strategy**: The passages illustrate the strategic importance of Port Arthur as a naval base and the implications of its capture for both the Japanese and Russian navies. The Japanese Navy's ability to execute surprise attacks and maintain pressure through a siege reflects advanced military strategy and planning.\n\n- **Psychological Warfare**: The psychological impact of the initial attacks and the subsequent siege highlights the role of morale in warfare.

This conflict was characterized by Japan's efforts to expand its influence in East Asia, particularly in Korea and Manchuria, which clashed with Russian imperial ambitions.\n\n1. **Conflict Background**:\n   - The Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) was a pivotal moment in early 20th-century military history, marking the first major conflict between a Western power (Russia) and an Asian power (Japan). The war was fueled by competition for territorial control and influence in Northeast Asia.\n\n2. **Japanese Navy's Strategic Initiative**:\n   - The Japanese Navy, under the command of Admiral T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d, executed a surprise attack on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur on February 8, 1904. This initial assault involved torpedo boat destroyers and inflicted significant damage on key Russian battleships, including the \"Tsesarevich\" and \"Retvizan.\" This strategic move showcased Japan's naval capabilities and tactical planning.\n\n3. **Subsequent Naval Engagements**:\n   - The attacks evolved into the Battle of Port Arthur, which included a series of naval engagements. Despite the Japanese Navy's efforts, the engagements were complicated by the formidable coastal artillery protecting the harbor and the Russian fleet's reluctance to engage in open sea battles. This indecisiveness highlighted the challenges of naval warfare at the time, where technology and fortifications played crucial roles.\n\n4. **Psychological and Tactical Implications**:\n   - The psychological impact of the Japanese attacks was profound, undermining Russian confidence and altering the dynamics of the war. Japan's ability to seize the initiative early on was critical in establishing its dominance in the conflict.\n\n5. **Siege and Attrition**:\n   - The siege of Port Arthur continued throughout 1904, with Japanese forces gradually wearing down Russian defenses. The Russian fleet, trapped and unable to break out, faced attrition, leading to a significant reduction in its operational capacity.\n\n6. **Final Destruction of the Fleet**:\n   - The culmination of the siege occurred on December 5, 1904, when Japanese forces systematically sank the remaining Russian ships through artillery bombardment. This marked the effective destruction of the Russian fleet at Port Arthur, with several battleships and cruisers lost.\n\n7. **Aftermath and Historical Significance**:\n   - The fall of Port Arthur on January 2, 1905, was a significant victory for Japan, demonstrating its rising military power and marking a shift in naval warfare dynamics. This event not only impacted the outcome of the Russo-Japanese War but also had lasting implications for international relations and the balance of power in East Asia.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe navy that destroyed the Russian fleet at Port Arthur was the **Japanese Navy**. This conclusion is supported by a comprehensive understanding of the strategic, psychological, and technological aspects of the conflict, as well as the broader historical context of the Russo-Japanese War.\n\n### Answer:\nJapan"}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nThe navy from which country destroyed the Russian fleet at Port Arthur after a number of attacks in 1904 and 1905?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['On the night of February 8, 1904 the Japanese Navy under the command of T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d began military operations against the Russian Empire. As result of sudden attack on Port Arthur, two Russian battleships were seriosly damaged by Tropedoes. This attack developed into a full-scale battle known as Siege of Port Arthur the next morning. Several attempts by Japanese Navy to attack Russian fleets were failed due to coastal artillery fire and the reluctance of the Russian fleet to leave the harbor for battle on the high seas, especially after the death of Admiral S. Makarov on April 13, 1904.\\n', 'On the night of 8 February 1904, the Japanese naval fleet under Admiral Heihachiro Togo opened the war with a surprise attack by torpedo boat destroyers on the Russian ships at Port Arthur, badly damaging two Russian battleships. The attacks developed into the Battle of Port Arthur the next morning. A series of indecisive naval engagements followed, in which the Japanese were unable to attack the Russian fleet successfully under shore batteries (\"coastal guns\") of the harbor and the Russians declined to leave the harbor for the open seas, especially after the death of Admiral Stepan Osipovich Makarov on 13 April 1904.\\n', 'On the night of 8 February 1904, the Japanese fleet under Admiral T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d opened the war with a surprise torpedo boat destroyer attack on the Russian ships at Port Arthur. The attack heavily damaged the \"Tsesarevich\" and \"Retvizan\", the heaviest battleships in Russia\\'s far Eastern theater, and the 6,600\\xa0ton cruiser \"Pallada\". These attacks developed into the Battle of Port Arthur the next morning. A series of indecisive naval engagements followed, in which Admiral T\u014dg\u014d was unable to attack the Russian fleet successfully as it was protected by the shore batteries of the harbour, and the Russians were reluctant to leave the harbour for the open seas, especially after the death of Admiral Stepan Osipovich Makarov on 13 April 1904. Although the actual Battle of Port Arthur was indecisive, the initial attacks had a devastating psychological effect on Russia, which had been confident about the prospect of war. The Japanese had seized the initiative while the Russians waited in port.\\n', 'At about 22:30 on Monday 8 February 1904, the Port Arthur attack squadron of 10 destroyers encountered patrolling Russian destroyers. The Russians were under orders not to initiate combat, and turned to report the contact to headquarters. However, as a result of the encounter, two Japanese destroyers collided and fell behind and the remainder became scattered. At circa 00:28 on 9 February, the first four Japanese destroyers approached the port of Port Arthur without being observed, and launched a torpedo attack against the \"Pallada\" (which was hit amidship, caught fire, and keeled over) and the \"Retvizan\" (which was holed in her bow). The other Japanese destroyers were less successful; many of the torpedoes became caught in the extended torpedo nets which effectively prevented most of the torpedoes from striking the vitals of the Russian battleships. Other destroyers had arrived too late to benefit from surprise, and made their attacks individually rather than in a group. However, they were able to disable the most powerful ship of the Russian fleet, the battleship \"Tsesarevich\". The Japanese destroyer \"Oboro\" made the last attack, around 02:00, by which time the Russians were fully awake, and their searchlights and gunfire made accurate and close range torpedo attacks impossible.\\n', 'On Tuesday 8 March 1904, Russian Admiral Stepan Makarov arrived in Port Arthur to assume command from the unfortunate Admiral Stark, thus raising Russian morale. He raised his flag on the newly repaired \"Askold\". On the morning of Thursday 10 March 1904, the Russian fleet took to the offensive, and attacked the blockading Japanese squadron, but to little effect. In the evening of 10 March 1904, the Japanese attempted a ruse by sending four destroyers close to the harbor. The Russians took the bait, and sent out six destroyers in pursuit; whereupon the Japanese mined the entrance to the harbor and moved into position to block the destroyers\\' return. Two of the Russian destroyers were sunk, despite efforts by Admiral Makarov to come to their rescue.\\n', 'The Russian fleet attempted to break out from Port Arthur and proceed to Vladivostok, but they were intercepted and dispersed at the Battle of the Yellow Sea. The remnant of the Russian fleet remained in Port Arthur, where the ships were slowly sunk by the artillery of the besieging army. Attempts to relieve the city by land also failed, and after the Battle of Liaoyang in late August, the Russians retreated to Mukden (Shenyang). Port Arthur finally fell on 2 January 1905, after a series of brutal, high-casualty assaults.\\n', 'At 10:30 on December 5, following another massive artillery bombardment, the Japanese managed to overrun 203 Meter Hill overlooking the harbour of Port Arthur with the Russian Pacific Fleet at anchor. They sent an artillery observer on the hill, directing the fire of the 28\\xa0cm howitzer, systematically sinking the Russian fleet, one ship after another. On December 5, 1904, the battleship \"Poltava\" was sunk, followed by the battleship \"Retvizan\" on December 7, 1904, the battleships \"Pobeda\" and \"Peresvet\" and the cruisers \"Pallada\" and \"Bayan\" on December 9, 1904. All six would be raised, repaired, renamed, and recommissioned by the Japanese after the war. The battleship \"Sevastopol\", although hit five times by shells, managed to move out of range of the guns. On the night of January 2, 1905, after Port Arthur surrendered, Captain Nikolai Essen of the \"Sevastopol\" had the crippled battleship scuttled in of water by opening the sea cocks on one side, so that the ship would sink on its side and could not be raised and salvaged by the Japanese.\\n', 'During the Russo-Japanese War the Japanese Third Army was besieging Port Arthur. While the capture of Port Arthur had been achieved in a single assault during the First Sino-Japanese War the situation was different in 1904. The Russians had been in possession of Port Arthur since 1897 and had constructed strong fortifications around the city following the plans of General Eduard Totleben. After the first general assault in August 1904 and over 16,000 casualties General Nogi, the commanding officer of the Japanese forces, requested heavy siege guns. With the arrival of the first battery of 28\\xa0cm howitzers, replacing those lost when the transport \"Hitachi Maru\", loaded with a battalion of the First Reserve Regiment of the Guards, was sunk by Russian cruisers in the Hitachi Maru Incident on June 15, 1904, the situation changed. The massive, 11-inch, howitzers could throw a 217\\xa0kilogram (478\\xa0pound) shell over 7.8 kilometers (4.8\\xa0miles), and Nogi then had the firepower necessary to make a serious attempt against the Russian fortifications. The huge shells were nicknamed \"roaring trains\" by the Russian troops (for the sound they made just before impact), and during their period at Port Arthur over 16,949 of these shells were fired.\\n', 'When the Russo-Japanese War broke out in 1904, \"Rurik\" and the other cruisers of the Pacific Squadron, , , and , were all charged with seeking out and destroying Japanese merchant vessels in the Sea of Japan and along the coasts of the Japanese home islands. By August 1904, only one ship had been sunk and the Imperial Japanese Army had moved siege artillery close enough to shell the main Russian port in the Pacific, Port Arthur. The siege of Port Arthur kept most of the Russian naval vessels assigned to the Pacific Squadron inside the port, despite several failed attempts at breakout.\\n', 'During the war the bulk of the Russian Pacific Fleet was located in Port Arthur where they were blockaded by the Japanese. On 10 August 1904 the ships at Port Arthur attempted breakout to Vladivostok, but were turned back in the Battle of the Yellow Sea. Admiral Jessen was ordered to rendezvous with them, but the order was delayed and his ships had to raise steam, so he did not sortie until the evening of 13 August. \"Bogatyr\" had been damaged earlier when she grounded and did not sail with the squadron. By dawn he had reached the island of Tsushima in the Tsushima Strait between Korea and Japan. He turned back for Vladivostok when he failed to see any ships from the Port Arthur squadron. north of the island he encountered the Japanese squadron commanded by Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonoj\u014d tasked to patrol the Tsushima Strait. The Japanese force had four modern armored cruisers, , , , and . The two squadrons had passed during the night without spotting the other and each had reversed course around first light. This put the Japanese ships astride the Russian route to Vladivostok.\\n']\n\nTask Description:\nPlease extract content from these passages that can help enhance the model's causal reasoning and logical inference abilities.\nconsolidate these contents, and analyze how the selected information may impact the improvement of the model's causal reasoning and logical inference capabilities.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To enhance the model's causal reasoning and logical inference abilities, we can extract and consolidate key information from the provided passages regarding the events surrounding the destruction of the Russian fleet at Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War.

As result of sudden attack on Port Arthur, two Russian battleships were seriosly damaged by Tropedoes. This attack developed into a full-scale battle known as Siege of Port Arthur the next morning. Several attempts by Japanese Navy to attack Russian fleets were failed due to coastal artillery fire and the reluctance of the Russian fleet to leave the harbor for battle on the high seas, especially after the death of Admiral S. Makarov on April 13, 1904.\n", "On the night of 8 February 1904, the Japanese naval fleet under Admiral Heihachiro Togo opened the war with a surprise attack by torpedo boat destroyers on the Russian ships at Port Arthur, badly damaging two Russian battleships. The attacks developed into the Battle of Port Arthur the next morning. A series of indecisive naval engagements followed, in which the Japanese were unable to attack the Russian fleet successfully under shore batteries (\"coastal guns\") of the harbor and the Russians declined to leave the harbor for the open seas, especially after the death of Admiral Stepan Osipovich Makarov on 13 April 1904.\n", "On the night of 8 February 1904, the Japanese fleet under Admiral T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d opened the war with a surprise torpedo boat destroyer attack on the Russian ships at Port Arthur. The attack heavily damaged the \"Tsesarevich\" and \"Retvizan\", the heaviest battleships in Russia's far Eastern theater, and the 6,600\u00a0ton cruiser \"Pallada\". These attacks developed into the Battle of Port Arthur the next morning. A series of indecisive naval engagements followed, in which Admiral T\u014dg\u014d was unable to attack the Russian fleet successfully as it was protected by the shore batteries of the harbour, and the Russians were reluctant to leave the harbour for the open seas, especially after the death of Admiral Stepan Osipovich Makarov on 13 April 1904. Although the actual Battle of Port Arthur was indecisive, the initial attacks had a devastating psychological effect on Russia, which had been confident about the prospect of war.

The Russians were under orders not to initiate combat, and turned to report the contact to headquarters. However, as a result of the encounter, two Japanese destroyers collided and fell behind and the remainder became scattered. At circa 00:28 on 9 February, the first four Japanese destroyers approached the port of Port Arthur without being observed, and launched a torpedo attack against the \"Pallada\" (which was hit amidship, caught fire, and keeled over) and the \"Retvizan\" (which was holed in her bow). The other Japanese destroyers were less successful; many of the torpedoes became caught in the extended torpedo nets which effectively prevented most of the torpedoes from striking the vitals of the Russian battleships. Other destroyers had arrived too late to benefit from surprise, and made their attacks individually rather than in a group. However, they were able to disable the most powerful ship of the Russian fleet, the battleship \"Tsesarevich\". The Japanese destroyer \"Oboro\" made the last attack, around 02:00, by which time the Russians were fully awake, and their searchlights and gunfire made accurate and close range torpedo attacks impossible.\n", "On Tuesday 8 March 1904, Russian Admiral Stepan Makarov arrived in Port Arthur to assume command from the unfortunate Admiral Stark, thus raising Russian morale.
