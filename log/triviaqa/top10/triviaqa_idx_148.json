The American roadrunner, specifically the greater roadrunner (Geococcyx californianus), is a bird commonly found in the southwestern United States and Mexico. It is well-known for its distinctive appearance and behavior, including its speed and terrestrial habits.\n\nThe American roadrunner is classified under the order Cuculiformes, which encompasses cuckoos and related birds. Within this order, it belongs to the family Cuculidae, which is characterized by birds that often have long tails and unique calls. This classification is supported by authoritative sources that confirm the greater roadrunner's membership in the Cuculidae family.\n\nAdditionally, the passages retrieved provide specific details:\n1. The greater roadrunner is indeed identified as belonging to the cuckoo family, Cuculidae.\n2. It is noted as a speedy, largely terrestrial bird found from California to Mexico and eastward to Texas.\n\nThis information reinforces the conclusion that the American roadrunner is part of the Cuculidae family, which is essential for updating the language model's knowledge and preventing factual errors.\n\nBy incorporating this authoritative knowledge, we can enhance the model's understanding of the American roadrunner's classification and ensure accurate representation in future responses.\n\n**Answer:** Cuculidae"}], "question_info": {"question": "The American roadrunner belongs to which family of birds?", "passages": ["Roadrunners are birds of the genus \"Geococcyx\".\n", "The treerunners are several species of bird in the ovenbird family Furnariidae:\n", "The greater roadrunner (\"Geococcyx californianus\") is a long-legged bird in the cuckoo family, Cuculidae, from Southwestern United States and Mexico.
