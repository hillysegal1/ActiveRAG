This appointment is historically significant as it represents the first time an Aboriginal person held a seat in the national parliament, thus marking a milestone in the political representation of Indigenous Australians.\n\n3. **Subsequent Developments**: Following Bonner's appointment, he was re-elected in 1972 and served until 1983. His presence in the Senate paved the way for future Indigenous politicians. In 1974, Hyacinth Tungutalum and Eric Deeral became the first Indigenous Australians elected to state and territory legislatures, respectively.
