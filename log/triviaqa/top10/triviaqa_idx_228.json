The Paralympics are a significant international multi-sport event for athletes with disabilities, occurring after the Olympic Games. \n\n1. **Historical Context**: The first Summer Paralympics took place in 1960, but the Winter Paralympics were established later. The first Winter Paralympic Games were held in **1976 in \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, Sweden**. This event was groundbreaking as it allowed multiple categories of athletes with disabilities to compete, marking a shift from previous competitions that primarily included wheelchair athletes.\n\n2. **Evolution of the Games**: The Winter Paralympics have been held every four years, typically in the same year as the Summer Paralympics until 1992. After that, they began to be held in even-numbered years, separate from the Summer Games. This change reflects an evolution in the organization and recognition of the Paralympics as a distinct event.\n\n3. **Significance of Inclusion**: The 1976 Games were pivotal not only for their timing but also for their inclusivity. They set a precedent for future events by recognizing the capabilities of athletes with various disabilities, which has contributed to a broader societal understanding and acceptance of disability in sports.\n\n4. **Causal Relationships**: The origins of the Paralympics, including the Winter Games, are linked to the rehabilitation of injured soldiers after World War II. This historical context highlights the role of sports in healing and reintegration into society, establishing a causal relationship between historical events and the development of sports for individuals with disabilities.\n\n5. **Impact on Current Practices**: Understanding the timeline and evolution of the Winter Paralympics allows the model to see how historical decisions influence current practices and policies in sports. For instance, the inclusion of various disability categories in the 1976 Games has shaped the structure of current Paralympic events.\n\nBy synthesizing this information, I can conclude that the first Winter Paralympics were not just a sporting event but a significant milestone in the recognition and inclusion of athletes with disabilities, reflecting broader societal changes.\n\n### Answer:\nThe first Winter Paralympics were held in 1976 in \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, Sweden."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nWhen were the first Winter Paralympics held?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The 1984 Winter Paralympic Games (German: \"Paralympische Winterspiele 1984\") were the third Winter Paralympics.
