This successor to the Nintendo GameCube was released in most territories in November and December 2006. It was the third (after the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3) seventh generation console to be released in Japan and North America, but was second in Europe, being released before the PlayStation 3.\n", "On April 25, 2011, Nintendo released an official statement announcing a system to succeed the Wii to be released during 2012, and that playable console units would be present at E3 2011. Speaking at an investor's conference, Iwata stated the Wii successor would \"offer something new for home game systems.\" He also confirmed that the device would not launch in fiscal year 2012, meaning that it would release after April 2012. In early June, Nikkei issued a report confirming earlier rumors that the new console would feature a controller with a 6-inch touchscreen that would give tablet-like controls to games, as well as a rechargeable battery and camera.\n", "On April 25, 2011, Nintendo confirmed that they were making a new console to be released in 2012. On June 7, 2011, the console was announced as being named the Wii U. The Wii U is Nintendo's first console to be able to play video games in 1080p HD. During the Electronics Entertainment Expo in 2011, Nintendo's press conference put a great amount of stress on the abilities and innovations of the new controller, a unit resembling a tablet.\n", "The seventh generation of gaming consoles followed a longer than usual console cycle. Nintendo was the first of the big three companies to announce their next generation console, doing so at E3 2011 with the unveiling of the Wii U, the successor to the Wii. The Wii U was released in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand in November 2012 and in Japan the following month. Reception to the console was mixed, with many reviewers criticising the limited choice of launch games available.\n", "At E3 in May 2005, Nintendo displayed the first prototype for their \"next-generation\" system, codenamed the Nintendo Revolution (now known as the Wii), its controller revealed at the Tokyo Game Show later that year.\n", "The GameCube is Nintendo's fourth home video game console, released during the sixth generation of video games. It is the successor to the Nintendo 64, and was first launched in Japan on September 14, 2001, followed by a launch in North America on November 18, 2001, and a launch in Europe on May 3, 2002. The successor to the GameCube is the Wii, which was first released in North America on November 19, 2006, and is backward compatible with GameCube games, memory cards, and controllers. Later Wii models removed the backwards compatibility feature.\n", "The Wii U is a video game console from Nintendo. Billed as the successor to the Wii, it was mentioned in statement released by Nintendo on April 25, 2011, that the company was planning to reveal it during E3 2011 and that playable console units would be present as well. Code-named \"Project Caf\u00e9\", it was officially introduced on June 7, 2011 with its final name, Wii U. The console released in North America on November 18, and in Europe, Australia and New Zealand on November 30, 2012, officially starting the \"eighth generation\" of video game consoles. Features of the new console include HD graphics support (on Wii U only), and a controller, the Wii U GamePad, which features a 6.2\u00a0inch touch screen built-in that can be used as a second screen providing added info and interactivity, such as \"asymmetric gameplay\". The Wii U GamePad allows some games to be played without needing a TV set, through Off-TV Play. Most peripheral hardware from its predecessor, the Wii, such as the Wii Remote and Wii Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Wii Balance Board are confirmed to work with the new console, and the console is backward compatible with all Wii and Virtual Console titles. The Wii U discontinues backward-compatibility support for GameCube discs and controllers, which also means that Wii games that support the GameCube's controller will instead require use of an alternate control scheme such as the Classic Controller when playing them on the Wii U. The Wii U also has its own more conventional controller, the Wii U Pro Controller, which resembles an Xbox 360 controller in form and function and is compatible with most Wii U and Virtual Console titles, but not original Wii games. The console is available in two sets. The basic set includes the Wii U console with 8 GB of internal memory, the Wii U GamePad, an AC adapter, an HDMI cable and the Wii Sensor Bar. The Deluxe set includes all of the items in the basic set, but it has 32 GB of internal memory instead of only 8 GB and is bundled with a GamePad charging cradle, stands for the GamePad and the console, as well as \"Nintendo Land\". The Sensor Bar is not included in the basic set in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.\n", "The Wii was released on November 19, 2006 as Nintendo's seventh-generation home console. Nintendo designed the console to appeal towards a wider audience than those of its main competitors, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, including \"casual\" players and audiences that were new to video games.\n"], "__answers__": ["U", "U", "U", "\ud83c\udd24", "\uff55", "\uff35", "\ud83c\udd64", "Letter U", "U (letter)", "\ud83c\udd84", "\u24e4", "\ud83c\udd44", "u letter", "letter u", "\u24b0", "u"]}}
