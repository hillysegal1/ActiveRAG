Dreys are usually built of twigs, dry leaves, and grass, and typically assembled in the forks of a tall tree. They are sometimes referred to as \"drey nests\" to distinguish them from squirrel \"cavity nests\" (also termed \"dens\"). In temperate regions, dreys become much more visible in the autumn, when leaf-fall reveals new nests built the previous summer or in early fall.\\n', \"BULLET::::- A squirrel's or ringtail possum's nest is called a drey.\\n\", 'Eastern gray squirrels build a type of nest, known as a drey, in the forks of trees, consisting mainly of dry leaves and twigs. The dreys are roughly spherical, about 30~60\\xa0cm in diameter and are usually insulated with moss, thistledown, dried grass, and feathers to reduce heat loss. Males and females may share the same nest for short times during the breeding season, and during cold winter spells. Squirrels may share a drey to stay warm. They may also nest in the attic or exterior walls of a house, where they may be regarded as pests, as well as fire hazards due to their habit of gnawing on electrical cables. In addition, squirrels may inhabit a permanent tree den hollowed out in the trunk or a large branch of a tree.\\n', \"Common ringtail possums live a gregarious lifestyle which centres on their communal nests, also called dreys. Ringtail possums build nests from tree branches and occasionally use tree hollows. A communal nest is made up of an adult female and an adult male, their dependant offspring and immature offspring of the previous year. A group of ringtail possums may build several dreys at different sites. Ringtail possums are territorial and will drive away any strange conspecifics from their nests. A group has a strong attachment to their site. In one experiment, in which a group was removed from their territory, it remained uncolonised for the following two years. Ringtail possum nests tend to be more common in low scrub and less common in heavily timbered areas with little under-story. Dreys contribute to the survival of the young when they are no longer carried on their mother's back.\\n\", 'The Kin are an ancient, rare and fabled species of rodent-like flying creatures.

Their size ranges from that of a large dog, to almost as large as dragons. They are capable of human speech. Unfortunately, the Kin are very rare in the time of the stories. They once lived on Dread Mountain, where they lived and bred prosperously, but were driven out by the Dread Gnomes who hunted them for sport and enjoyment.

Instead, the term \"kittens\" is more accurately applied to rabbits.\n\n### Enhanced Conclusion:\n\nIn summary, while tree squirrels rear their young in nests called dreys, the young are not referred to as kittens; that term is specific to rabbits. Therefore, the answer to the question, based on the enhanced reasoning process, is that the rodent commonly associated with dreys is the squirrel, but it is important to clarify that their young are not called kittens.\n\nAnswer:\nSquirrel (but their young are not called kittens; that term is specific to rabbits)."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nWhich rodent rears its young, called kittens, in a nest called a drey?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['A drey is the nest of a tree squirrel or a flying squirrel.

In addition, squirrels may inhabit a permanent tree den hollowed out in the trunk or a large branch of a tree.\n", "Common ringtail possums live a gregarious lifestyle which centres on their communal nests, also called dreys. Ringtail possums build nests from tree branches and occasionally use tree hollows. A communal nest is made up of an adult female and an adult male, their dependant offspring and immature offspring of the previous year. A group of ringtail possums may build several dreys at different sites. Ringtail possums are territorial and will drive away any strange conspecifics from their nests. A group has a strong attachment to their site. In one experiment, in which a group was removed from their territory, it remained uncolonised for the following two years. Ringtail possum nests tend to be more common in low scrub and less common in heavily timbered areas with little under-story. Dreys contribute to the survival of the young when they are no longer carried on their mother's back.\n", "The Kin are an ancient, rare and fabled species of rodent-like flying creatures. They are among the few harmless, gentle creatures in Deltora, thought to only exist in fairy tales to the people of Deltora. They resemble cute, round, bulbous crosses between a pig and a ferret, with pig-like back legs and rodent-like front legs, large leathery wings, velvet-esque fur, expressive faces and pouches like marsupials. Their size ranges from that of a large dog, to almost as large as dragons. They are capable of human speech. Unfortunately, the Kin are very rare in the time of the stories. They once lived on Dread Mountain, where they lived and bred prosperously, but were driven out by the Dread Gnomes who hunted them for sport and enjoyment. Now all that are left of them live at the enchanted Dreaming Spring, where they are gradually dwindling. In the fifth book of the first series, \"Dread Mountain\", Lief, Barda and Jasmine encounter the remaining tribe of Kin at Dreaming Spring and save their only young, an energetic youngster named Prin from a pair of Grey Guards. For reasons of adventure, homesickness and owing a debt to the heroes, three older Kin agree to take them to their former, now Gnome-controlled home of the mountain. When they can go no further and these three Kin leave, the three heroes discover that Prin, desperate to see the Kin's ex-home and disobeying her mother, had followed them. She accompanies them for the rest of the book, helping the three heroes defeat Gellick and eventually allowing the Kin to return to their former home and now live in peace with the Dread Gnomes. They reappear in the third series, where they help Barda, Lief and Jasmine.\n", "Many lagomorphs breed several times a year and produce large litters. This is particularly the case in species that breed in underground, protective environments such as burrows. The altricial young of rabbits, called kittens, are born naked and helpless after a short gestation period and the mother can become pregnant again almost immediately after giving birth. The mothers are able to leave these young safely and go off to feed, returning at intervals to feed them with their unusually rich milk. In some species, the mother only visits and feeds the litter once a day but the young grow rapidly and are usually weaned within a month. Hares live above ground and their litters, containing leverets, are born in \"forms\" concealed among tussocks and scrub. They have a strategy to prevent predators from tracking down their litter by following the adults' scent. They approach and depart from the nesting site in a series of immense bounds, sometimes moving at right angles to their previous direction. The young are precocial and a small number are born after a longer gestation period, already clad in short fur and able to move around.\n", "A rookery is a colony of breeding animals, generally birds. Rooks \u2013 northern-European and central-Asian members of the crow family \u2013 nest in prominent colonies (multiple nests) at the tops of trees. The word applies to the nesting place of birds, such as crows and rooks, the source of the term. The breeding grounds of colony-forming seabirds and marine mammals (true seals or sea lions) and even some turtles are also referred to as rookeries.\n", "The dassie rat (\"Petromus typicus\") is an African rodent found among rocky outcroppings. It is the only living member of its genus, Petromus, and family, Petromuridae. The name \"dassie\" means \"hyrax\" in Afrikaans, and the two animals are found in similar habitats. \"Petromus\" means \"rock mouse\" and dassie rats are one of many rodents sometimes called rock rats. The family and genus names are sometimes misspelled as Petromyidae and Petromys.\n", "Squirrel nests are called dreys and can be seen in trees, built from sticks and leaves wrapped with long strands of grass. There are two stick nest types made by the western gray squirrel: the first is a large, round, covered shelter nest for winter use, birthing, and rearing young. The second is more properly termed a \"sleeping platform,\" a base for seasonal or temporary use. Both types are built with sticks and twigs and are lined with leaves, moss, lichens and shredded bark. The birthing nest may be lined with tail hair. The nest may measure by up to and is usually found in the top third of the tree. Young or traveling squirrels will also \"sleep rough\" when weather permits, balanced spread-eagled on a tree limb high above the forest floor. This attitude is also adopted for cooling in hot weather, a behavior also observed in raccoons.\n", "Tree cavities, usually those formed by woodpeckers, are remodeled to winter dens and often serve as nurseries for late winter litters. If existing trees lack cavities, leaf nests known as dreys are built by cutting twigs with leaves and weaving them into warm, waterproof shelters. Similar leafy platforms are built for summer litters and are often referred to as \"cooling beds.\"\n"], "__answers__": ["Squirrels", "Squirrels", "Squirrel", "Squirrel", "squirl", "Eichhoernchen", "bushy tailed tree rat", "Rats with bushy tails", "Sciuridae", "squirrl", "Scuridae", "scuridae", "squirrel", "scuiridae", "Bigtail rat", "skiouros", "Bushy tailed tree rat", "Squirrell", "sciuridae", "Eichhornchen", "Squirl", "squirell", "bigtail rat", "squirel", "Squirrl", "eichhornchen", "squirrell", "Skiouros", "sciurid", "Sciurid", "Eichh\u00f6rnchen", "Squirell", "Scuiridae", "squirrels", "eichh\u00f6rnchen", "rats with bushy tails", "eichhoernchen", "Squirel"]}}
