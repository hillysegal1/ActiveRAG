The interview is notable for the band's use of explicit language during a live broadcast, which shocked viewers and generated considerable media attention.\n\nThe presenter associated with this infamous event is Bill Grundy. He was hosting the Thames Television program \"Today\" when he interviewed The Sex Pistols. Grundy's interactions with the band, including his provocative comments, encouraged the band members to use bad language, leading to a scandal that reverberated through the media.\n\nThe consequences of this incident were profound: Bill Grundy was fired by ITV, and the \"Today\" program was subsequently canceled due to the backlash from viewers, which included a flood of complaints to the network. This incident marked a pivotal moment in the rise of punk rock as a cultural phenomenon in the UK, highlighting the tensions between traditional media standards and the emerging punk ethos.\n\nAdditionally, the interview's impact extended beyond immediate viewer reactions; it played a crucial role in shaping public perceptions of punk culture and contributed to the genre's notoriety. The program \"Today\" was eventually replaced by \"Thames at Six,\" reflecting the network's response to the fallout from the incident.\n\nIn summary, Bill Grundy was not merely a host but an active participant in the controversy, and the incident itself was a significant cultural moment that influenced the trajectory of punk music and its reception in mainstream media.\n\n**Answer:**\nBill Grundy"}], "question_info": {"question": "Which English TV presenter became very famous on Dec 1st 1976 when he interviewed the punk band The Sex Pistols live on TV prompting much bad langauge from the band?", "passages": ["On 1 December 1976, the punk band the Sex Pistols were interviewed live on Thames's regional news magazine programme, \"Today\". Members of the group uttered obscenities during their interview with Bill Grundy. Grundy, in his introduction, said they are \"as drunk as I am\", but later claimed his comment was a joke, and had allowed the bad language to illustrate the character of the individuals in the group. The interview filled two minutes at the end of the programme, but the production team feared trouble in the studio if they stopped the programme mid-air. Thames's telephone switchboard was jammed by complaining viewers. Responding to the incident, Thames said in a statement: \"Because the programme was live, it was impossible to foresee the language that would be used.\" The press continued to be interested in the incident for several days. Grundy was suspended and \"Today\" ended soon afterwards; his career never recovered. Over time, Thames replaced \"Today\" with a more conventional news offering as seen on other ITV stations. \"Thames at Six\" was launched, later \"Thames News\".\n", "BULLET::::- December 1, 1976\u00a0\u2013 Appearing in a live interview on the Thames Television pre-watershed programme \"Today\" as last-minute replacements for fellow EMI artists Queen, the Sex Pistols were interviewed by Bill Grundy to promote their recently released \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" single. During the interview, Steve Jones said the band had \"fucking spent\" its label advance and Johnny Rotten used the word \"shit.\" Pistols guitarist Steve Jones called Grundy a \"dirty sod\" and a \"dirty old man\", leading Grundy to goad the band into swearing on live TV, and Jones ended the interview with \"you dirty bastard,\" \"you dirty fucker,\" and \"what a fucking rotter\". Grundy was fired by ITV and Today was cancelled.\n", "The Sex Pistols' live TV skirmish with Bill Grundy on December 1, 1976 was the signal moment in British punk's transformation into a major media phenomenon, even as some stores refused to stock the records and radio airplay was hard to come by. Press coverage of punk misbehavior grew intense: On January 4, 1977, \"The Evening News\" of London ran a front-page story on how the Sex Pistols \"vomited and spat their way to an Amsterdam flight\". In February 1977, the first album by a British punk band appeared: \"Damned Damned Damned\" (by the Damned) reached number thirty-six on the UK chart. The EP \"Spiral Scratch\", self-released by Manchester's Buzzcocks, was a benchmark for both the DIY ethic and regionalism in the country's punk movement. The Clash's self-titled debut album came out two months later and rose to number twelve; the single \"White Riot\" entered the top forty. In May, the Sex Pistols achieved new heights of controversy (and number two on the singles chart) with \"God Save the Queen\". The band had recently acquired a new bassist, Sid Vicious, who was seen as exemplifying the punk persona. The swearing during the Grundy interview and the controversy over \"God Save the Queen\" led to a moral panic.\n", "The Sex Pistols' behaviour, as much as their music, brought them national attention. On 1 December 1976, the band and members of the Bromley Contingent created a storm of publicity by swearing during an early evening live broadcast of Thames Television's \"Today\" programme. Appearing as last-minute replacements for fellow EMI artists Queen, who had dropped out due to Freddie Mercury having a dental appointment, the band and their entourage were offered drinks as they waited to go on air. During the interview, Jones said the band had \"fucking spent\" its label advance and Rotten used the word \"shit\". Host Bill Grundy, who had earlier claimed to be drunk, engaged in repartee with Siouxsie Sioux, who declared that she had \"always wanted to meet\" him. Grundy responded, \"Did you really? We'll meet afterwards, shall we?\" This prompted the following exchange between Jones and the host:\n", "BULLET::::- 1 December \u2013 Punk rock band the Sex Pistols achieve public notoriety as they say several swear words live on Bill Grundy's TV show, following the release of their debut single \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" on 26 November.\n", "BULLET::::- 1 December \u2013 Punk group The Sex Pistols cause a storm of controversy and outrage in the UK by swearing well before the 9pm watershed on the regional Thames Television news programme \"Today\", hosted by Bill Grundy. Grundy, who has goaded them into doing so, is temporarily sacked. \"Today\" is replaced by \"Thames at Six\" a year later.\n", "The Sex Pistols were an English punk rock band that formed in London in 1975. They were responsible for initiating the punk movement in the United Kingdom and inspiring many later punk and alternative rock musicians. Although their initial career lasted just two and a half years and produced only four singles and one studio album, \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\", they are regarded as one of the most influential acts in the history of popular music.\n", "Sex Pistols is a box set anthology of the career of the punk band The Sex Pistols with singer Johnny Rotten. It was released on 3 June 2002. The set comprises three themed CDs and an 80-page booklet.\n", "The Sex Pistols' 4 June 1976 concert at Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall was to become one of the most significant and mythologised events in rock history. Among the audience of merely forty people or so were many who became leading figures in the punk and post-punk movements: Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, who organised the gig and were in the process of auditioning new members for the Buzzcocks; Bernard Sumner, Ian Curtis and Peter Hook, later of Joy Division; Mark E. Smith, later of The Fall; punk poet John Cooper Clarke and Morrissey, later of The Smiths. Anthony H. Wilson, founder of Factory Records, saw the band for the first time at the return engagement on 20 July. Among the many musicians of a later time who have acknowledged their debt to the Pistols are members of the Jesus and Mary Chain, NOFX, The Stone Roses, Guns N' Roses, Nirvana, Green Day, and Oasis. Calling the band \"immensely influential\", a London College of Music study guide notes that \"many styles of popular music, such as grunge, indie, thrash metal and even rap owe their foundations to the legacy of ground breaking punk bands\u2014of which the Sex Pistols was the most prominent.\"\n", "The first Sex Pistols gig to attract broader attention was as a supporting act for Eddie and the Hot Rods, a leading pub rock group, at the Marquee on 12 February 1976. Rotten \"was now really pushing the barriers of performance, walking off stage, sitting with the audience, throwing Jordan across the dance floor and chucking chairs around, before smashing some of Eddie and the Hot Rods' gear.\" The band's first review appeared in the \"NME\", accompanied by a brief interview in which Steve Jones declared, \"Actually we're not into music. We're into chaos.\" Among those who read the article were two students at the Bolton Institute of Technology, Howard Devoto and Pete Shelley, who headed down to London in search of the Sex Pistols. After chatting with McLaren at Sex, they saw the band at a couple of late February gigs. The two friends immediately began organising their own Pistols-style group, the Buzzcocks. As Devoto later put it, \"My life changed the moment that I saw the Sex Pistols.\"\n"], "__answers__": ["Bill Grundy", "Bill Grundy", "Bill GRUNDY", "bill grundy"]}}
