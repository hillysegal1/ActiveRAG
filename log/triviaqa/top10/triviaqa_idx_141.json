Notably, I will focus on shows that might have a diverse cast or unique character names.\n\n3. **Cross-Referencing**: I will check the context of the characters mentioned in the passages. For instance, \"Warren\" is identified as a character in a British sitcom that aired in 2019, while \"McLaren\" is associated with a telemovie from 2011. However, there is no direct mention of \"Blanco\" in the passages.\n\n4. **Identifying the Show**: Given the absence of a clear connection to \"Blanco,\" I will focus on the character \"Warren\" from the British sitcom and the character \"McLaren\" from the telemovie. However, since the original question asks for a comedy that includes all three characters, I will need to consider if they might belong to a different show altogether.\n\n5. **Revisiting Known Comedies**: Upon reflection, I recall that \"Superstore\" is a popular comedy that features characters with similar names.

There is no clear reference to \"Blanco\" in the passages. Therefore, it appears that the characters may not all belong to the same show based on the available information.
