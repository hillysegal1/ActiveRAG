This pronouncement was significant as it established a foundational principle for American foreign policy: non-interventionism. Washington's decision was influenced by the political landscape of the time, where the nation was divided between Federalists, who favored Britain, and Jeffersonian Republicans, who supported France. By choosing neutrality, Washington aimed to maintain national unity and avoid internal conflict.\n\nWashington's later **Farewell Address** in 1796 further articulated this policy, warning against \"entangling alliances\" with foreign nations. He emphasized the dangers of permanent alliances, advocating for a foreign policy that prioritized independence and self-determination. This address not only reinforced the principles laid out in the Proclamation of Neutrality but also served as a guiding document for future American leaders.\n\nThe implications of Washington's decisions were profound, laying the groundwork for a long-term foreign policy that would influence subsequent administrations. His principles of neutrality and non-interventionism became cornerstones of American foreign relations, shaping the nation's approach to international conflicts for generations.\n\nTo enhance the model's causal reasoning and logical inference capabilities, it is essential to recognize the interconnectedness of Washington's decisions and their historical context. Understanding the cause-and-effect relationship between Washington's neutrality and the political dynamics of his time allows for better inference about the motivations behind political actions. Additionally, analyzing the long-term effects of these decisions provides insights into how foundational policies evolve and influence future governance.\n\nBy integrating this knowledge, the model can improve its ability to reason about political dynamics, recognize the complexity of decision-making processes, and predict the outcomes of similar situations based on historical precedents.\n\n### Answer\nNeutrality Proclamation."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nWhat was the title of George Washingtons pronouncement in 1793 that provided a basis for the USA to avoid any involvement in foreign conflicts?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n[\"After Britain and France went to war in 1792, George Washington declared neutrality, with unanimous support of his cabinet, after deciding that the treaty with France of 1778 did not apply.
