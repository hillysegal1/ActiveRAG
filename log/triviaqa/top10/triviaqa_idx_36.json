The prefix \"zoo-\" originates from the Greek word \"zoon,\" meaning \"animal,\" while the suffix \"-phobia\" denotes an irrational fear or aversion. Thus, we can infer that zoophobia relates to animals.\n\nHowever, to enhance our understanding, we can incorporate additional information from authoritative sources:\n\n1. **Definition of Zoophobia**: Zoophobia is not just a general fear of animals; it specifically refers to a non-sensible fear of dangerous or threatening animals, such as wild dogs (e.g., wolves, dingoes, and coyotes), big cats, bears, or venomous snakes. This definition highlights that it is a phobia that can significantly impact an individual's daily life.\n\n2. **Classification**: Zoophobia is classified as a specific phobia, which means it can manifest as an irrational fear or even a simple dislike of any non-human animals. This classification provides a psychological context for understanding the nature of the fear.\n\n3. **Broader Scope**: The fear associated with zoophobia can encompass a wide range of animals, not limited to those that are dangerous or threatening. This broader understanding is essential for accurately defining the phobia.\n\n4. **Impact on Life**: The distress or dysfunction caused by zoophobia in an individual's everyday life is a critical aspect that should be acknowledged. This impact can vary in severity and can affect social interactions and personal well-being.\n\nBy integrating this additional knowledge, we can provide a more comprehensive and accurate definition of zoophobia.\n\n### Answer:\nZoophobia is a fear of animals, specifically characterized as a non-sensible fear of dangerous or threatening animals, such as wild dogs, big cats, bears, or venomous snakes.
