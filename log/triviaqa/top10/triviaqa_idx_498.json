Beginning on the afternoon of July 3, four cars from Frayer-Miller, Pope-Toledo, Peerless and White Steamer raced for a $500 silver trophy. The winning Pope-Toledo car covered 828.5 miles. A protest was filed by the Frayer-Miller and Peerless teams, alleging the Pope-Toledo was not owned by the driver, instead sent from the factory with an engine built for racing.\n", "The first national race of Belgium was held in 1925 at the Spa region's race course, an area of the country that had been associated with motor sport since the very early years of racing. To accommodate Grand Prix motor racing, the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps race course was built in 1921 but it was only used for motorcycle racing until 1924. After the 1923 success of the new 24 hours of Le Mans in France, the Spa 24 Hours, a similar 24-hour endurance race, was run at the Spa track.\n", "The first ever 24 hours automobile sport event at the Slovakia Ring was the Hankook 24H SLOVAKIA RING on 15 and 16 June 2016, as part of the Touring Car Endurance Series. The race had a rather close finish. After 24 hours there was just a 20.9 seconds lead for ARC Bratislava by Ferry Monster Autosport.\n"], "__answers__": ["England", "Engla rice", "\u00e6ngland", "ENGLAND", "\u00c6ngla land", "Anglica", "england u k", "england united kingdom", "england uk", "pow sows", "land of angles", "Aenglaland", "england", "Sasainn", "Starks Field School", "etymology of england", "Englnad", "Ingland", "Sasana", "UK, (England)", "The land of the Angles", "English Nation", "\u00c6nglaland", "Engla land", "Languages of England", "Name of England", "lloegr", "England, United Kingdom", "england s", "England, UK", "engla land", "auld enemy", "ingland", "England, U.K.", "Aengland", "englistan", "England's", "Engelond", "Etymology of England", "aengland", "englnad", "Auld enemy", "aenglaland", "anglica", "life in england", "Englaland", "Land of the Angles", "englaland", "\u00c6ngland", "starks field school", "english nation", "Life in England", "name of england", "uk england", "engelond", "Pow Sows", "\u00e6ngla land", "sasana", "\u00e6nglaland", "engla rice", "Lloegr", "Englistan", "sasainn", "languages of england"]}}
