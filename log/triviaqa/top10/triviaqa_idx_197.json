This transition marks the end of the schilling as Austria's currency.\n\n4. **Understanding Currency Dynamics**:\n   - The schilling underwent various reforms and was stabilized through ties to other currencies, such as the U.S. dollar and the German mark. This illustrates the adaptive measures taken by Austria to maintain economic stability.\n\n5. **Demonetization and Its Implications**:\n   - The demonetization of the schilling on July 1, 2002, coinciding with the euro's introduction, highlights the logistical challenges and public adjustments required during currency transitions.\n\n6. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - The model can infer that political events (like the Anschluss) and economic decisions (like the introduction of the euro) directly influenced the currency's status.
