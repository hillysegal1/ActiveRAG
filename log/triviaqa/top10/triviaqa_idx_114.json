The closest point in North Africa is Morocco, specifically the city of Tangier, which is situated just across the Strait of Gibraltar.\n\nThe retrieved passages confirm that there are indeed ferry services operating between Gibraltar and Tangier. Notably, one passage states, \"Also, a ferry links Gibraltar with Tangier in Morocco,\" and another mentions that \"Ferries by 'FRS' running twice a week from Gibraltar to Tanger-Med port provide access to the Moroccan railway system.\" This indicates that Tangier is not only the closest city but also has regular ferry connections to Gibraltar, making it a common route for travelers crossing from Europe to North Africa.\n\nAdditionally, the historical context provided in the passages is significant. It mentions that the ferry service between Gibraltar and Algeciras was halted in 1969 but was reopened on December 16, 2009. This historical insight helps contextualize the current ferry operations and highlights the importance of the service in connecting Gibraltar to North Africa.\n\nFurthermore, the passages emphasize the strong ties between Gibraltar and Morocco, noting that \"Gibraltar has strong ties with Morocco due to its proximity to the country, with regular flights and ferry services.\" This reinforces the idea that Tangier is a key destination for ferry travel from Gibraltar.\n\nIn summary, the combination of geographical proximity, the existence of regular ferry services, and the historical context all point to Tangier, Morocco, as the North African city linked by ferry to Gibraltar.\n\n**Answer:**\nTangier"}], "question_info": {"question": "Gibraltar is linked by ferry to which North African city?", "passages": ["BULLET::::- Gibraltar (UK), no connection; a ferry service connects Gibraltar to the Tanger-Med port and railway station\n", "Passenger and cargo ships anchor in the Gibraltar Harbour.
