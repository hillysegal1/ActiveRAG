Based on the successful American TV show \"The Real World\", the show premiered on 1 October 1995 on TV1000. Following the show's success, \"\" aired in 1996, but it became the last Real World season in Sweden following poor ratings.\n", "\"The Real World\" is an American reality television show in which a group of strangers live together in a house for several months, as cameras record their interpersonal relationships. First broadcast in 1992, the show is the longest-running program in MTV history, consistently ranking as a top-rated cable series among viewers 12\u201334 years old. 30 seasons have aired in their entirety.\n", "Reality TV was a popular genre of television programming in the UK in 2002. The third series of the UK version of \"Big Brother\"\u2014which was showing while Russian's con took place\u2014attracted audience figures of approximately 5.8\u00a0million. Most British reality TV programmes at the time centred on a team of people trying to accomplish a specific goal or target. For example, the 2000 series \"Jailbreak\" challenged a group to escape from a mock prison, while the 2001 series \"The Mole\" gave the contestants the task of discovering which of them was sabotaging their attempts to win money. Most reality TV shows offered a cash reward to successful participants\u2014both \"Jailbreak\" and the first series of \"The Mole\" offered a prize of \u00a3100,000.\n", "The series \"Expedition Robinson\", created by television producer Charlie Parsons, which first aired in 1997 in Sweden (and was later produced in a large number of other countries as \"Survivor\"), added to the \"Nummer 28\"/\"Real World\" template the idea of competition and elimination. Cast members/contestants battled against each other and were removed from the show until only one winner remained (these shows are now sometimes called elimination shows). \"Changing Rooms\", a program that began in 1996, showed couples redecorating each other's houses, and was the first reality show with a self-improvement or makeover theme. The dating reality show \"Streetmate\" premiered in the UK in 1998. Originally created by Gabe Sachs as \"Street Match\", it was a flop in the United States. But the show was revamped in the UK by Tiger Aspect Productions and became a cult hit. The production team from the original series later created the popular reality shows \"Strictly Come Dancing\", \"Location, Location, Location\", and the revamped \"MasterChef\", among others. The 1980s and 1990s were also a time when tabloid talk shows became more popular. Many of these featured the same types of unusual or dysfunctional guests who would later become popular as cast members of reality shows.\n", "The Val\u00f3 Vil\u00e1g (Real World) is Hungary's reality show aired by RTL Klub. Val\u00f3Vil\u00e1g became the most popular Hungarian reality television programme ever. The show was aired in the same time slot as the localized version of \"Big Brother\". While TV2 recorded the highest number of viewers in 2002, VV1 had an average 1.5 million. In 2003, VV2 was a breakthrough. While it had 1.75 million viewers daily, BB2 recorded only 800 000 viewers. RTL Klub started the third season, which was an absolute success with 2.06 million viewers daily. The first three seasons were broadcast between 2002 and 2004, but returned in November 2010 for the fourth season after years of hiatus.\n", "Open Het Dorp (\"Open The Village\") was the first big fundraising TV show in the Netherlands. It aired on Dutch TV on 26 and 27 November 1962.\n", "In 2004, POP TV introduced their first reality show. \"Sanjski mo\u0161ki\" (2004) was the Slovenian version of \"The Bachelor\", and lasted for one season. In the same year, \"Na\u0161a mala klinika\" (2004-2007), a new Slovenian sitcom, was introduced and lasted for seven full seasons. The sitcom was watched on average by 300.000 people against 2 million people, which is the population of Slovenia. In the next year, two new reality shows were introduced: \"Sanjska \u017eenska\" (2005-2006), a local version of \"The Bachelorette\" which lasted for two seasons, and a Slovenian version of reality show \"The Bar\", called \"Bar\" (2005-2006), which lasted also for two seasons.

POP TV also co-produced a new crime series named \"Balkan Inc.\" (2006), with Nova TV and TV Pink.\n", "The first breakthrough came in 2002 with their hidden camera-program \"Urs\u00e4kta r\u00f6ran (vi bygger om)\" (\"Pardon the mess (we're redecorating)\") broadcast by TV4. The program created viewer storms, debates and was reported to Swedish Broadcasting Commission several times. Six episodes were made but only four aired. The concept involved Filip and Fredrik making fun of both famous and unknown people using a hidden camera and similar setups. The show was largely influenced by shows like \"Pyjamas\", a similar show that aired the year before on youth channel ZTV. The jokes were of a rather unusual, sometimes experimental, nature and some viewers took offense, feeling that the pair were humiliating innocent people. Often the \"jokes\" were taken far beyond what in most people produced a laugh. The show made headlines due to a segment called \"the Swedish Nazi-reference championship\" where they fooled singer and former Expedition Robinson-star Emma Andersson into an interview where they made as many Nazi-references as possible and observed her reactions. Due to that segment, TV4 was fined by the Swedish Broadcasting Commission who argued that, since Emma was not a political person, the segment was intrusive to her privacy and integrity. Fredrik has later said that \"Urs\u00e4kta r\u00f6ran (vi bygger om)\" was an order from TV4 because they wanted a show that 90% hated and 10% liked.\n", "Precedents for television that portrayed people in unscripted situations began in the late 1940s. \"Queen for a Day\" (1945\u20131964) was an early example of reality-based television. The 1946 television game show \"Cash and Carry\" sometimes featured contestants performing stunts. Debuting in 1948, Allen Funt's hidden camera show, \"Candid Camera\" (based on his previous 1947 radio show, \"Candid Microphone\"), broadcast unsuspecting ordinary people reacting to pranks. In 1948, talent search shows, such as \"Ted Mack's Original Amateur Hour\" and \"Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts\", featured amateur competitors and audience voting. In the 1950s, game shows \"Beat the Clock\" and \"Truth or Consequences\" involved contestants in wacky competitions, stunts, and practical jokes. \"Confession\" was a crime/police show that aired from June 1958 to January 1959, with interviewer Jack Wyatt questioning criminals from assorted backgrounds. The radio series \"Nightwatch\" (1951\u20131955) tape-recorded the daily activities of Culver City, California police officers. The series \"You Asked for It\" (1950\u20131959) incorporated audience involvement by basing episodes around requests sent in by postcard from viewers. \"You're Another\", a science fiction short story by American writer Damon Knight, was first published in the June 1955 issue of \"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\". It has perhaps the earliest fictional depiction of what is now called reality television.\n", "The Real World: Visby was a Swedish and Norwegian reality television program that was broadcast on TV1000 in late 1996.
