The Prime Minister of Australia is typically the leader of the political party that has the most seats in the House of Representatives. As of my last update, I know that Anthony Albanese was elected as Prime Minister in May 2022, representing the Australian Labor Party. Since there have been no significant elections or changes reported that would suggest a new Prime Minister has taken office since then, it is reasonable to conclude that he remains in that position.\n\nAnswer: Anthony Albanese is the current Australian Prime Minister.\nTo update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions. \nI retrieved some knowledge that may update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions\nNote that these passages are retrieved from the most authoritative knowledge repositories, so they are assumed to be correct.\nknowledge:\nBased on the provided passages, there is no specific mention of the current Australian Prime Minister as of the latest knowledge cut-off in October 2023.
