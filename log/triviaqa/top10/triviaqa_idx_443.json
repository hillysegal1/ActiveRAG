The explosion that sank the ship was attributed to Spanish sabotage by many in the U.S., despite the lack of conclusive evidence. This incident stirred public outrage and fueled the growing sentiment for intervention in Cuba, where the U.S. had interests due to Spain's colonial rule and the ongoing Cuban War of Independence.\n\nThe public outcry following the sinking, coupled with sensationalist journalism (often referred to as \"yellow journalism\"), created immense pressure on the U.S. government to take action against Spain. This culminated in the U.S. Congress passing a resolution on April 19, 1898, demanding Spain withdraw from Cuba. When Spain did not comply, the U.S. officially declared war on Spain on April 25, 1898. This declaration marked the beginning of the Spanish-American War, which was characterized by a swift U.S. military victory and the eventual acquisition of territories such as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.\n\nIn analyzing this sequence of events, we can identify several causal relationships:\n1. **Causation**: The sinking of the USS Maine directly contributed to the U.S. declaration of war on Spain, as it served as a rallying point for those advocating for military intervention.\n2. **Public Sentiment**: The role of public opinion, influenced by media portrayal and national pride, was crucial in shaping the political landscape that led to the declaration of war.\n3. **Historical Context**: Understanding past conflicts, such as the War of 1812 and the U.S. relations with colonial powers, provides insight into the motivations behind the U.S. actions in 1898.\n\nBy synthesizing these elements, we can enhance the model's ability to reason about causality and infer logical connections between historical events.\n\n### Answer:\nThe United States declared war on Spain following the sinking of the USS Maine on April 25, 1898."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nWhat nation did the United States declare war on - after the sinking of the USS Maine?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['BULLET::::- Crompton, Samuel Etinde. \"The Sinking of the USS Maine: Declaring War Against Spain.\" New York: Chelsea House Publishers, 2009.\\n', 'The subsequent retirement of the British expeditionary force from its base in Castine to Nova Scotia ensured that eastern Maine would remain a part of the United States.
