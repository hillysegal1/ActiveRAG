The most notable characteristic is that many hawthorn species produce red fruits, which are commonly referred to as haws.\n\n4. **Culinary and Cultural Significance**:\n   - The fruits of hawthorn trees are edible and can be consumed raw or cooked. They are often used to make jams, jellies, and beverages in various cultures, such as in China and Korea, where they hold culinary importance.\n\n5. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - The relationship between the genus **Crataegus** and the production of haws establishes a clear causal link: if a tree belongs to the genus **Crataegus**, it is likely to produce haws.
