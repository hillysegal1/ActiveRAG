Operation Felix was a planned German invasion that was never executed. Historical context suggests that this operation was aimed at a specific territory that was strategically significant during the war. \n\nThe most notable British Overseas Territory that fits this description is Gibraltar. Gibraltar is located at the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea and has been of great military importance due to its strategic position. The Germans recognized this significance and planned Operation Felix to capture Gibraltar, which would have allowed them to control naval access to the Mediterranean.\n\nAnswer:\nGibraltar\nTo update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions. \nI retrieved some knowledge that may update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions\nNote that these passages are retrieved from the most authoritative knowledge repositories, so they are assumed to be correct.\nknowledge:\nBased on the retrieved passages regarding Operation Felix, the following points can be extracted that may update the model's knowledge and help prevent factual errors related to this topic:\n\n1. **Specificity of the Target**: The passages consistently identify Gibraltar as the primary target of Operation Felix.

Historical context indicates that Operation Felix was a planned military operation that was never executed, aimed at a territory of significant strategic importance.\n\nThe retrieved passages consistently identify Gibraltar as the primary target of Operation Felix. Gibraltar's location at the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea made it a crucial point for naval operations, and the Germans recognized its military significance. Capturing Gibraltar would have allowed them to control naval access to the Mediterranean, which was vital for their military strategy.\n\nAdditionally, the context provided in the passages reveals that Operation Felix was part of a broader German strategy that included considerations for the invasion of other territories, such as Portugal, Madeira, and the Azores. This information enhances our understanding of the strategic implications of Operation Felix beyond just Gibraltar, indicating that the operation was not only about capturing a single territory but was also tied to larger military objectives.\n\nThe involvement of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco is also noteworthy, as his intransigence contributed to the postponement and eventual abandonment of the operation. This detail highlights the geopolitical complexities that influenced the feasibility of military operations during that time.\n\nFurthermore, the mention of \"Operation Felix-Heinrich,\" which involved plans to withdraw German troops from the USSR to capture Gibraltar, adds depth to the timeline and objectives of the operation. It illustrates the shifting priorities within the German military as the war progressed.\n\nLastly, the reference to Hitler's Directive No. 18 concerning the seizure of Gibraltar provides insight into the command structure and decision-making processes within the German military, which is relevant for understanding military strategy and leadership during World War II.\n\nBy integrating these points, we can achieve a more nuanced understanding of Operation Felix, its objectives, and the factors that influenced its planning and execution, thereby reducing the likelihood of model illusions related to this historical event.\n\n**Answer:**\nGibraltar"}], "question_info": {"question": "Operation Felix was the codename for a proposed German invasion of which British Overseas Territory during World War II?", "passages": ["BULLET::::- Operation Felix \u2013 The planned German invasion of Gibraltar\n", "BULLET::::- Operation Felix, a German World War II project to conquer Gibraltar\n", "BULLET::::- Operation Felix (Spanish/German joint plan for control of Gibraltar, Canary Islands, Cape Verde, and Azores)\n", "BULLET::::- Operation Felix 1940 - German planned invasion of Gibraltar via the Iberian Peninsula\n", "The Germans had planned an attack on Gibraltar, codenamed Operation Felix, which was never initiated.
