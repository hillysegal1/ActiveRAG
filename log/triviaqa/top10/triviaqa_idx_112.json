Despite this, it was commercially successful, grossing $159 million against a $60 million budget. This contrast between critical reception and box office performance illustrates the complexity of audience engagement with films.\n\n4. **Context of Awards:**\n   - The Razzie Awards are intended to highlight the worst in film, contrasting with prestigious awards like the Academy Awards, which celebrate excellence.
