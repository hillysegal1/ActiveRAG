This process occurs approximately once a month and is regulated by hormonal signals from the pituitary gland. \n\nAfter the egg is released, the remaining structure of the follicle transforms into the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum is crucial for hormone production, particularly progesterone, which is essential for maintaining the uterine lining (endometrium) in preparation for a potential pregnancy. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum will eventually degenerate after about 12\u201314 days, leading to a decrease in progesterone levels.\n\nIn addition to the corpus luteum, the uterine lining thickens in anticipation of a fertilized egg. If fertilization does not take place, both the unfertilized egg and the thickened uterine lining are shed during menstruation. This cyclical process illustrates the interconnectedness of hormonal regulation, ovulation, and the menstrual cycle, highlighting the cause-and-effect relationships that govern reproductive biology.\n\nUnderstanding these relationships enhances the model's ability to reason about biological processes. For instance, recognizing that hormonal signals lead to ovulation and subsequent changes in the body allows for better predictions about what happens if fertilization occurs versus if it does not. Additionally, the model can infer how disruptions in hormonal balance might affect ovulation and menstrual regularity.\n\n### Answer:\nWhen the egg is released from the ovary, the corpus luteum is left behind, which is the remnant of the follicle that contained the egg.
