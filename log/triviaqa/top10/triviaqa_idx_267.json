This decline has been explained by Major-General Abu Bakr al-Guindi, head of Egypt's Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics, as being the result of Copts having the highest emigration rate, the lowest birthrate and the highest income level in the country.

Copts are also the largest Christian denomination in Sudan and Libya. Historically, they spoke the Coptic language, a direct descendant of the Demotic Egyptian that was spoken in late antiquity. While the vast majority of Copts are of Egyptian ancestry, North Africans and Northeast Africans who have converted to the religion also identify as such.\\n', 'Comprising about ten to fifteen per cent of the total population in Egypt, Coptic Orthodox Christians (usually referred to as Copts) rely on the many services of the Orthodox Church and its dogma. Because the Copts compromise a small percentage of the population, most live in remote areas around Egypt mostly in the Zabbaleen, a poverty stricken area located in the Mokattam Village, Assuit, Akhmim, Girgeh, Luxor, Kuft and Nagada. As part of their core belief, Copts practice and accept the \u201cSeven Sacrament,\u201d which are explained as channels in which believers receive the sanctifications of the Holy Spirit. In Greek, the word \u201cSacrament\u201d translates to \u201cmystery\u201d and Copts use this term specifically because of the unexplainable absolution that may derive from it. The Seven Sacraments are affirmed and derived by contemporary Orthodox Catechisms and textbooks. Although there are more than seven official Sacraments of the church, the Orthodox Confessions in the 17th century, endorsed by local councils against the Reformation such as Metrophanes Critopoulos in 1625, Peter Mogila in 1638 and Dostheos of Jerusalem in 1672, determined that there were seven important Sacraments to a spiritual life and the Orthodox Church accepted this. The Seven Sacraments are in order of: baptism, confirmation, repentance and confession, communion, matrimony, anointing of the sick, and priesthood. Here, we will further examine the sixth Sacrament, \u2018anointing of the sick\u2019, but first we must briefly contextualize Orthodoxy in Egypt to understand the hierarchy of the Church among Egyptians in Egypt and worldwide.\\n', \"Christianity is second largest religion in Egypt. The number of Egyptian Christians, nearly all of whom are Coptic Christians (adherents of the Coptic Orthodox Church or other Coptic churches), is uncertain; 10-15% is currently the accepted range and estimation by Egyptian officials, although it may be higher up 25%.

It is estimated that there are over one million Coptic Orthodox Christians in North America as a whole. A small number of Egyptian Christians who immigrated to the U.S. include Coptic Catholics and Protestants. In addition to Coptic Christians, there are also small groups of non-native Christians from Egypt, such as Armenians, Greeks, and Syro-Lebanese, who belong to Armenian, Eastern Orthodox, or Melkite Catholic churches.

This highlights the historical and contemporary presence of Copts outside of Egypt.\n\n4. **Copts as a Minority in Egypt**: Copts constitute about 10-15% of Egypt's population, making them the largest religious minority in the country. This minority status is crucial for understanding the challenges they face, including instances of persecution and sectarian violence.\n\n5. **Historical Context of Coptic Christianity**: Christianity in Egypt dates back to the Roman era, with Alexandria being an early center of Christianity. This historical context is essential for understanding the significance of the Coptic Church and its long-standing presence in the region.\n\n6. **Copts in the Diaspora**: Many Copts have emigrated to countries such as the United States and Canada, with estimates suggesting over one million Coptic Orthodox Christians in North America. This diaspora has implications for the cultural dynamics of the Coptic community.\n\n7. **Religious Intolerance and Persecution**: There are ongoing issues of religious intolerance and sectarian violence against Coptic Christians in Egypt, including documented cases of attacks and abductions. This context is vital for accurately representing the challenges faced by Copts.\n\nBy incorporating this enhanced knowledge, the model can provide a more accurate and nuanced understanding of Coptic Christians, their demographics, and the challenges they face, thereby reducing the potential for model illusions.\n\n**Answer:**\nCoptic Christians are primarily found in Egypt, where they make up about 10-15% of the population. They are also present in other countries, including Libya, Sudan, the United States, Canada, and various European nations, with a global population of approximately 30 million Coptic Orthodox Christians."}], "question_info": {"question": "In what country would you find Coptic Christians?", "passages": ["BULLET::::- (Egyptian) Coptic diaspora \u2013 About 3 million Coptic Christians, members of the Coptic Christian Church based in Egypt for about 2,000 years, live around the world. The largest numbers are in North America and Australia; and Great Britain, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway and Sweden in Europe.\n", "It is noted that Copts also live in Denmark, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, and Sweden.\n", "There are about 30 million Coptic Orthodox Christians in the world. Between 23 and 25 million of them are found in Egypt under the jurisdiction of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. Since Egypt does not have an official government census on religion, estimates of the size of Egypt's Christian population vary from the estimated low previous government figures of 6 to 7 million to the 12 million reported by some Christian leaders in 2008. The actual numbers may be in the 23 to 25 million range, out of an Egyptian population of more than 90 million. However, in 2011, the Pew Research Center announced that Copts in Egypt constitute 4.5% of the population, while the Catholic Holy See puts Copts at 6 to 8%. Then in 2017 government owned news Al Ahram estimated the percentage of Copts at 10 to 15%. However, in 2012 after the Egyptian revolution the Muslim Brotherhood was drafting new constitution then Major-General Abu Bakr al-Guindi claimed that the lower figures support a downward trend in the percentage of Copts in Egypt, as recorded in consecutive estimated Egyptian censuses since a 1927 high where Egyptian Christians formed 8.3% of the population. This decline has been explained by Major-General Abu Bakr al-Guindi, head of Egypt's Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics, as being the result of Copts having the highest emigration rate, the lowest birthrate and the highest income level in the country. However, this statement and population count has been rejected by the Coptic Church.\n", "Copts in Libya may refer to people born in or residing in Libya of full or partial Coptic origin. Coptic people are an ethnoreligious group that form the largest Christian group in Libya, the Coptic Orthodox Church in the country having an estimated 60,000 adherents. The Coptic Church is known to have historical roots in Libya long before the Arabs (and Islam) advanced westward from Egypt into Libya. A part of the community is made up of immigrants from Egypt (see Copts in Egypt).\n", "The Copts (; , ) are an ethnoreligious group indigenous to Northeast Africa who primarily inhabit the area of modern Egypt, where they are the largest Christian denomination in the country. Copts are also the largest Christian denomination in Sudan and Libya. Historically, they spoke the Coptic language, a direct descendant of the Demotic Egyptian that was spoken in late antiquity. While the vast majority of Copts are of Egyptian ancestry, North Africans and Northeast Africans who have converted to the religion also identify as such.\n", "Comprising about ten to fifteen per cent of the total population in Egypt, Coptic Orthodox Christians (usually referred to as Copts) rely on the many services of the Orthodox Church and its dogma. Because the Copts compromise a small percentage of the population, most live in remote areas around Egypt mostly in the Zabbaleen, a poverty stricken area located in the Mokattam Village, Assuit, Akhmim, Girgeh, Luxor, Kuft and Nagada. As part of their core belief, Copts practice and accept the \u201cSeven Sacrament,\u201d which are explained as channels in which believers receive the sanctifications of the Holy Spirit. In Greek, the word \u201cSacrament\u201d translates to \u201cmystery\u201d and Copts use this term specifically because of the unexplainable absolution that may derive from it. The Seven Sacraments are affirmed and derived by contemporary Orthodox Catechisms and textbooks. Although there are more than seven official Sacraments of the church, the Orthodox Confessions in the 17th century, endorsed by local councils against the Reformation such as Metrophanes Critopoulos in 1625, Peter Mogila in 1638 and Dostheos of Jerusalem in 1672, determined that there were seven important Sacraments to a spiritual life and the Orthodox Church accepted this. The Seven Sacraments are in order of: baptism, confirmation, repentance and confession, communion, matrimony, anointing of the sick, and priesthood. Here, we will further examine the sixth Sacrament, \u2018anointing of the sick\u2019, but first we must briefly contextualize Orthodoxy in Egypt to understand the hierarchy of the Church among Egyptians in Egypt and worldwide.\n", "Christianity is second largest religion in Egypt. The number of Egyptian Christians, nearly all of whom are Coptic Christians (adherents of the Coptic Orthodox Church or other Coptic churches), is uncertain; 10-15% is currently the accepted range and estimation by Egyptian officials, although it may be higher up 25%. While a minority within Egypt, Egypt's Christian population is the largest in absolute numbers in the Middle East and North Africa. The history of Christianity in Egypt dates to the Roman era as Alexandria was an early center of Christianity.\n", "In contrast to the population of Egypt, where Muslims constitute approximately 90% of the population, the majority of Egyptian Americans are Coptic Christians, with Muslims forming a minority in the community. The Copts began to immigrate to the United States as early as the late 1940s. There are hundreds of Coptic Orthodox churches in the United States (along with over 90 congregations in Canada). It is estimated that there are over one million Coptic Orthodox Christians in North America as a whole. A small number of Egyptian Christians who immigrated to the U.S. include Coptic Catholics and Protestants. In addition to Coptic Christians, there are also small groups of non-native Christians from Egypt, such as Armenians, Greeks, and Syro-Lebanese, who belong to Armenian, Eastern Orthodox, or Melkite Catholic churches. There is even a small Jewish community that exists.\n", "Copts (Coptic: \"ou.Remenk\u012bmi en.Ekhristianos\", literally: \"Egyptian Christian\") are native Egyptian Christians, usually Oriental Orthodox, who currently make up between 10 and 15% of the population of Egypt \u2014 the largest religious minority of that country. While Copts have cited instances of persecution throughout their history, Human Rights Watch has noted \"growing religious intolerance\" and sectarian violence against Coptic Christians in recent years, and a failure by the Egyptian government to effectively investigate properly and prosecute those responsible. Since 2011 hundreds of Egyptian Copts have been killed in sectarian clashes, and many homes and businesses have been destroyed. In just one province (Minya), 77 cases of sectarian attacks on Copts between 2011 and 2016 have been documented by the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. The abduction and disappearance of Coptic Christian women and girls also remains a serious ongoing problem.\n", "Many millions of Middle Eastern Christians currently live in the diaspora, elsewhere in the world. These include such countries as Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, the United States and Venezuela among them. There are also many Middle Eastern Christians in Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, France (due to its historical connections with Lebanon, Egypt, Syria), and to a lesser extent, Ireland, Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece, Bulgaria, Russia, and the Netherlands.\n"], "__answers__": ["Egypt", "Gift of the Nile", "Kemmet", "gift of nile", "Arab Republic of Egypt", "Eygpt", "r egypt", "etymology of egypt", "egipt", "name of egypt", "eypt", "republic of eygpt", "eygpt", "\u062c\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0651\u0629 \u0645\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0651\u0629", "jumhuriyat misr al arabiyah", "Jumhuriyat Misr al'Arabiyah", "egyptian republic", "arab republic of egypt", "Eypt", "Egipto", "Etymology of Egypt", "Egypte", "egipto", "egypt", "egypt info", "national identity of egyptians", "Name of Egypt", "A .R .
