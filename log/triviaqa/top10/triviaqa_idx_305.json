It was revealed that the song was a \"last-minute\" addition during recording sessions of \"Songs from the Big Chair\" (1985). The decision to include the song in the album came after Orzabal played two chords on his acoustic guitar for Hughes. It was recorded in two weeks and later added as the final track on the album. According to Orzabal, he initially regarded the song as a lightweight that would not fit with the rest of the album.\n", "BULLET::::1. \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" (Chris Hughes, Roland Orzabal, Ian Stanley) \u2013 5:34\n"], "__answers__": ["Tears for Fears", "tears 4 fears", "Tears for fears", "Tears From Fears", "tears for fears", "tears from fears", "Tears For Fears", "Tears 4 Fears", "TEARS FOR FEARS"]}}
