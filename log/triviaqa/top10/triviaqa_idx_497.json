Most serious players obtain proper snooker cues, though novices may settle for a thick-tipped pool cue. The game can easily be adapted informally to standard, large-pocketed pool tables, with snooker ball sets the same size as regular American pool balls (to compensate for the larger pool ); Saluc, for example, manufactures such a 57\u00a0mm (\u00a0inch) set, under their Aramith brand name. American snooker sets often come with that are numbered with their values.\n", "A snooker table has six pockets, one at each corner and one at the center of each of the longest side cushions. The pockets are around 86\u00a0mm (3.5\u00a0in), though high-class tournaments may use slightly smaller pockets to increase difficulty. The amount of (trimmed underside of the rubber cushion's protruding at the pocket opening), if any, has a strong effect on how easily a ball is accepted by the pocket (the \"\"). On snooker and English billiards tables, the pocket entries are rounded, while pool tables have sharp \"\". This affects how accurate shots need to be to get into a pocket, and how fast they can be when not dead-on, including shots that run along and against a cushion, making snooker more difficult to play than pool. According to the WPBSA official rule book, \"the pocket openings shall conform to the owned and authorised by The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA)\". The WPBSA and IBSF rule books' equipment sections do not actually specify the measurements and shapes of these proprietary templates which change from time to time, requiring that the templates be dated. The organisations do not recognise tournament play or records (maximum breaks, etc.) if not performed on tables that conform to then-current templates.\n"], "__answers__": ["twenty-two", "twenty two", "22"]}}
