He is depicted as a pig, which is significant as pigs represent the ruling class in the allegorical narrative. Snowball is characterized by his intelligence, idealism, and commitment to the principles of Animalism, which advocate for equality and collective governance among the animals.\n\nSnowball plays a crucial role in the initial rebellion against Mr. Jones, the human farmer, and is instrumental in establishing the farm's governance and infrastructure, including the ambitious plan to build a windmill. His eloquence and leadership skills make him a respected figure among the other animals.\n\nHowever, his rivalry with Napoleon, another pig who represents Joseph Stalin, leads to a power struggle that ultimately results in Snowball's exile. This conflict illustrates the cause-and-effect relationship inherent in political power dynamics, where initial success can lead to downfall due to ambition and manipulation by rivals. Snowball's expulsion mirrors Trotsky's historical exile from the Soviet Union, emphasizing the allegorical nature of the story.\n\nThe narrative also explores the consequences of ideological differences, as Snowball's vision for a fair society contrasts sharply with Napoleon's desire for power and control. This dichotomy enhances the model's ability to infer motivations behind actions and predict outcomes based on those motivations.\n\nFurthermore, the varying fates of Snowball in different adaptations\u2014where he is either killed or survives but is declared an enemy\u2014highlight the importance of context in interpreting narratives.

His conflict with Napoleon, who represents Joseph Stalin, ultimately leads to his exile, reflecting the power struggles and ideological conflicts of the Russian Revolution."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nWhat animal is Snowball in George Orwell's book Animal Farm?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['BULLET::::- Snowball (\"Animal Farm\"), a character in George Orwell\\'s political satire \"Animal Farm\"\\n', 'Snowball is a character in George Orwell\\'s \"Animal Farm\".
