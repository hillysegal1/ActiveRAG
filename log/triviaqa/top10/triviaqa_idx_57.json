Lindisfarne, also known as Holy Island, is a significant site in Christian history, particularly during the Anglo-Saxon period.\n\n1. **Historical Context**: \n   - The conversion of the Northumbrian monarchy to Christianity in 627 set the stage for missionary efforts in the region. King Oswald, who reigned from 634 to 642, played a crucial role in inviting monks from Iona to aid in this conversion.\n\n2. **Saint Aidan's Mission**:\n   - Saint Aidan, an Irish monk from Iona, was sent to Northumbria at the request of King Oswald. In 635, he founded the Lindisfarne monastery, which became a pivotal center for Christian learning and missionary activity. His role as the first bishop of Lindisfarne allowed him to establish a strong Christian community and spread the faith among the Anglo-Saxon population.\n\n3. **Cultural and Religious Significance**:\n   - The monastery at Lindisfarne was not only a religious institution but also a cultural hub. It was associated with the creation of the Lindisfarne Gospels, a masterpiece of Insular art, which reflects the artistic and scholarly achievements of the community. This highlights the monastery's role in preserving and promoting Christian teachings and culture.\n\n4. **Challenges and Resilience**:\n   - The Lindisfarne community faced significant challenges, including Viking invasions that led to the destruction of the settlement in 793. Despite these adversities, the community demonstrated resilience, adapting to changing circumstances and continuing its religious mission.\n\n5. **Legacy of Saint Aidan**:\n   - Aidan's legacy extends beyond his lifetime; he is remembered as a key figure in the establishment of Christianity in Northumbria. His influence is seen in the subsequent development of monasticism in the region and the veneration of other saints, such as Saint Cuthbert, who was also associated with Lindisfarne.\n\nBy synthesizing this information, we can conclude that the saint who established the monastery and Christian community on Lindisfarne in 635 is indeed Saint Aidan. His foundational role in the Christianization of Northumbria and the cultural contributions of the Lindisfarne community underscore the importance of this historical event.\n\n### Answer:\nSaint Aidan"}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nWhich saint established a monastery and Christian community on the island of Lindisfarne in the year 635 ?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['Lindisfarne, also known as \"Holy Island\", is located off the coast of Northumberland in northern England (Chilvers 2004).

In around 635 AD, the Irish missionary Aidan founded the Lindisfarne monastery on \"a small outcrop of land\" on Lindisfarne. King Oswald of Northumbria sent Aidan from Iona to preach to and baptise the pagan Anglo-Saxons, following the conversion to Christianity of the Northumbrian monarchy in 627. By the time of Aidan's death in 651, the Christian faith was becoming well-established in the area. The Lindisfarne gospel book is associated with the Cult of St. Cuthbert. Cuthbert was an ascetic member of a monastic community in Lindisfarne, before his death in 687. The book was made as part of the preparations to translate Cuthbert\u2019s relics to a shrine in 698. Lindisfarne has a reputation as the probable place of genesis according to the Lindisfarne Gospels. Around 705 an anonymous monk of Lindisfarne wrote the \"Life of St Cuthbert\". His bishop, Eadfrith, swiftly commissioned the most famous scholar of the age, Bede, to help shape the cult to a new purpose.\n", "When Saint Aidan came at the request of Oswald to preach to the Northumbrians he chose the island of Lindisfarne as the site of his church and monastery, and made it the head of the diocese which he founded in 635. For some years the see continued in peace, numbering among its bishops Saint Cuthbert, but in 793 Vikings landed on the island and burnt the settlement, killing many of the monks. The survivors, however, rebuilt the church and continued to live there until 883, when, through fear of a second invasion of the Danes, they fled inland, taking with them the body of Cuthbert and other holy relics.\n", "Northumberland is often called the \"cradle of Christianity\" in England, because Christianity flourished on Lindisfarne\u2014a tidal island north of Bamburgh, also called Holy Island\u2014after King Oswald of Northumbria (reigned 634\u2013642) invited monks from Iona to come to convert the English. A monastery at Lindisfarne was the centre of production of the Lindisfarne Gospels (around 700). It became the home of St Cuthbert (about 634\u2013687, abbot from about 665), who is buried in Durham Cathedral.\n", "The monastery of Lindisfarne was founded circa 634 by Irish monk Saint Aidan, who had been sent from Iona off the west coast of Scotland to Northumbria at the request of King Oswald. The priory was founded before the end of 634 and Aidan remained there until his death in 651. The priory remained the only seat of a bishopric in Northumbria for nearly thirty years. Finian (bishop 651\u2013661) built a timber church \"suitable for a bishop's seat\". St Bede, however, was critical of the fact that the church was not built of stone but only of hewn oak thatched with reeds. A later bishop, Eadbert removed the thatch and covered both walls and roof in lead. An abbot, who could be the bishop, was elected by the brethren and led the community. Bede comments on this:\n", "Christianity has been the largest religion in the region since the Early Middle Ages; its existence in Britain dates back to the late Roman era and the arrival of Celtic Christianity. The Holy Island of Lindisfarne played an essential role in the Christianisation of Northumbria, after Aidan from Connacht founded a monastery there as the first Bishop of Lindisfarne at the request of King Oswald. It is known for the creation of the Lindisfarne Gospels and remains a place of pilgrimage. Saint Cuthbert, a monk of Lindisfarne, was venerated from Nottinghamshire to Cumberland, and is today sometimes named the patron saint of Northern England. The Synod of Whitby saw Northumbria break from Celtic Christianity and return to the Roman Catholic church, as calculations of Easter and tonsure rules were brought into line with those of Rome.\n", "The monastery at Lindisfarne was founded by Aidan in 635, and based on the practices of the Columban monastery in Iona, Scotland. The location of the bishopric shifted to Lindisfarne, and it became the centre for religion in Northumbria. The bishopric would not leave Lindisfarne and shift back to its original location at York until 664. Throughout the eighth century, Lindisfarne was associated with important figures. Aidan, the founder, Wilfrid, a student, and Cuthbert, a member of the order and a hermit, all became bishops and later Saints. Aidan assisted Heiu to found her double monastery at Hartlepool. She too came to be venerated as a saint.\n", "Aidan of Lindisfarne Irish: Naomh Aodh\u00e1n (died 31 August 651) was an Irish monk and missionary credited with restoring Christianity to Northumbria. He founded a monastic cathedral on the island of Lindisfarne, known as Lindisfarne Priory, served as its first bishop, and travelled ceaselessly throughout the countryside, spreading the gospel to both the Anglo-Saxon nobility and the socially disenfranchised (including children and slaves).\n", "In response to the perceived lack of affordable housing on the isle of Lindisfarne, in 1996 a group of islanders established a charitable foundation known as the Holy Island of Lindisfarne Community Development Trust. They built a visitor centre on the island using the profits from sales. In addition, eleven community houses were built and are rented out to community members who want to continue to live on the island. The trust is also responsible for management of the inner harbour. The Holy Island Partnership was formed in 2009 by members of the community as well as organisations and groups operating on the island.\n", "The Holy Island of Lindisfarne, also known simply as Holy Island, is a tidal island off the northeast coast of England, which constitutes the civil parish of Holy Island in Northumberland. Holy Island has a recorded history from the 6th century AD; it was an important centre of Celtic Christianity under Saints Aidan of Lindisfarne, Cuthbert, Eadfrith of Lindisfarne and Eadberht of Lindisfarne. After the Viking invasions and the Norman conquest of England, a priory was reestablished. A small castle was built on the island in 1550.\n", "It is believed that there was a religious community of monks, with links to Lindisfarne, living and working where St Michael's Church stands today. At that time, higher sea levels would mean the community may have lived on an island south of the river's mouth. The Lindisfarne monks attempted to cross the Solway Firth to Ireland in a boat, but a strong storm blew up and the Lindisfarne Gospels were lost overboard. The monks were forced back to shore. Tradition says that the Gospels, which were probably inside a wooden box, were discovered water-stained but safe in the sea near Candida Casa on the Isle of Whithorn.\n"], "__answers__": ["Aidan of Lindisfarne", "Saint Aidan", "St Aidan", "Oedan", "St. Aidan of Lindisfarne", "oedan", "st aidan", "ST AIDAN", "aidanus", "saint aidan", "St. Aidan", "apostle of northumbria", "saint aidan of lindisfarne", "Aidan of lindisfarne", "Saint Aidan of Lindisfarne", "Saint Aidan (disambiguation)", "Apostle of Northumbria", "aidan of lindisfarne", "Aidanus", "saint aidan disambiguation", "st aidan of lindisfarne"]}}
