The River Thames is a significant landmark that runs through central London, and several railway stations are situated near or adjacent to it. However, only one station is particularly notable for being built on a bridge that spans the river itself.\n\n1. **Identifying Key Stations**: London Bridge is a central railway terminus located in Southwark, which is historically significant and one of the oldest railway stations in London. It opened in 1836 and is known for its extensive usage, handling over 50 million customers annually. This establishes its importance in London's transport network.\n\n2. **Understanding the Bridge Context**: While London Bridge is a railway station, it is also a bridge that crosses the River Thames. This dual function is crucial in identifying it as the answer to the question. Other stations, such as Waterloo and Charing Cross, are located near the river but do not occupy a bridge over it.\n\n3. **Comparative Analysis**: The mention of Fulham Railway Bridge, which crosses the River Thames and carries the London Underground District line, helps clarify that while there are other bridges and stations, they do not hold the same significance as London Bridge in terms of being a major railway terminus.\n\n4. **Historical and Functional Significance**: The historical context of London Bridge as one of the oldest railway stations enhances its profile. Understanding its role as a terminus and its connection to the broader transport network allows for a more nuanced inference about its importance.\n\n5. **Spatial Awareness**: The geographical relationship between London Bridge and the River Thames is essential for understanding its significance. The station's location directly over the river highlights its unique position compared to other stations.\n\nIn conclusion, the reasoning process confirms that London Bridge is the only famous railway station in London that is located on a bridge over the River Thames, making it the correct answer to the question.\n\n### Answer:\nLondon Bridge Station"}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nWhich famous London railway station is located on a bridge over the River Thames?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['London Bridge is a central London railway terminus and connected London Underground station in Southwark, south-east London.
