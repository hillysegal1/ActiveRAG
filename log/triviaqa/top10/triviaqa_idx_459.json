This is a crucial detail, as it establishes the geographical limits of its distribution. The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands are located in the Pacific Ocean and are renowned for their unique biodiversity.\n\n2. **Unique Adaptations**:\n   - The marine iguana has evolved specific adaptations that allow it to thrive in a marine environment. It primarily feeds on algae and is capable of swimming, which distinguishes it from other iguana species. This adaptation is significant because it highlights the iguana's role in the marine ecosystem of the Gal\u00e1pagos.\n\n3. **Evolutionary Background**:\n   - The marine iguana is an endemic species that evolved from a mainland ancestor of land iguanas. This evolutionary history is important as it explains the unique characteristics of the marine iguana and emphasizes the impact of geographic isolation on species development. The limited gene flow and differing environments on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands have led to the marine iguana's distinct adaptations.\n\n4. **Ecological Context**:\n   - Understanding the ecological context of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands is also vital. The islands are a UNESCO World Heritage site and are known for their diverse ecosystems, which include marine and terrestrial habitats. The marine iguana plays a specific role in this ecosystem, primarily as a herbivore that helps maintain the balance of marine vegetation.\n\n5. **Clarification of Misconceptions**:\n   - It is essential to clarify that the marine iguana is not found on the mainland of South America or on any other islands outside of the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago. This specificity reinforces the idea that the marine iguana is a unique species tied to its specific environment.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy synthesizing this information, we can confidently assert that the marine iguana is a unique species that is exclusively found on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.
