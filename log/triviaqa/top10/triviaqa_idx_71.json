She returned to the U.S. immediately for surgery. However, the team kept her name on the roster, and she was given a gold medal despite not competing. This gave her the most World Championships medals of any female American gymnast, with ten. Simone Biles would break that record in 2015.\n", "There were only 4 routines left for each gymnast to compete. With 2 down and 2 to go the places were now: Gnauck 1st, Davydova 2nd, Shaposhnikova and Comaneci joint 3rd. Nadia Com\u0103neci then scored a 10 on bars, the only gymnast to receive a perfect score that night. (It was her first perfect score on bars in a major competition since the 1976 Olympics). Neil Admur, New York Times, 25 July 1980, A17, \"The drama on the final rotation added to the suspense. Miss Gnauck was second among the 9 gymnasts on the vault, Miss Davydova seventh on the bars and Miss Comaneci eight on the beam\". Maxi Gnauck held the lead until her last routine when she vaulted insecurely. She scored 9.7, on a vault with a start value of 9.9, the same as she had scored for this vault at 1979 European Championships in Denmark and 79 World Championships in United States. Barry Lorge, Washington Post, 25 July 1980, p.\u00a09, \"Gnauck, first of the contenders up in the fourth and final rotation. Her first vault looked good but was too safe : 9.7. She knew she had to do better but she buckled on the landing of her second vault\".

It is generally recognized that the first person to score a perfect 10 at the Olympic Games was Romanian Nadia Com\u0103neci, at the 1976 Games in Montreal. Other women who accomplished this feat at the Olympics include Nellie Kim, also in 1976, Mary Lou Retton in 1984, Daniela Siliva\u0219 and Yelena Shushunova in 1988, and Lavinia Milo\u0219ovici in 1992. The first man to score a perfect 10 is considered to be Alexander Dityatin, at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. (However, in the 1924 Paris Olympics, 22 men achieved a mark of 10 in rope-climbing, with one Albert S\u00e9guin getting a second 10 in the sidehorse vault, events that are no longer part of artistic gymnastics.)\n", "Maria Kondratyevna Gorokhovskaya (, ; 17 October 1921 \u2013 22 July 2001) was a Soviet gymnast of Jewish descent.
