This classification indicates that they typically possess ten appendages, which include both walking legs and claws.\n\n2. **Standard Leg Count**: In the typical anatomical structure of crabs, there are five pairs of legs (10 total), where the first pair is modified into large claws (chelae). The remaining pairs are primarily used for locomotion.\n\n3. **Variability Among Species**: While most crabs conform to the decapod standard of ten appendages, there are exceptions:\n   - Some species, like porcelain crabs, may have fewer than the typical five pairs of walking legs, resulting in a total of six appendages (four walking legs and two claws).\n   - Other species, such as coconut crabs, may exhibit adaptations in their legs for specific functions, such as climbing or carrying objects, which can influence the visibility and functionality of their limbs.\n\n4. **Functional Roles of Appendages**: The legs of crabs serve multiple purposes beyond locomotion, including feeding, defense, and mating behaviors. The last pair of legs in some species may be reduced or specialized for specific tasks, which can affect the overall count of functional limbs.\n\n5. **Contextual Definitions**: The inclusion of claws in the total leg count can vary based on definitions. In many contexts, especially when discussing total appendages, claws are included in the count. This is important for clarity in communication about crab anatomy.\n\n6. **Inference from Knowledge**: Given the classification and functional roles, one can infer that while most crabs have ten appendages, specific species may deviate from this norm.

Paddle crabs have a hard shell, or carapace and ten legs, five to each side. The first set of legs of the crab is tipped with large claws. The claws of the paddle crab are fairly long and narrow and are curled in a sickle shape. They are decapods which means they have 10 legs and are situated symmetrically with five legs on each side. The claws are also serrated with large points on the insides. The carapace, or shell, of the crab can range from pale orange to light gray, and can be spotted with brown and red. The carapace is a rough oval shape, and the front end has five teeth to either side of the eyes. Paddle crabs can reach sizes ranging from 100\u2013140\\xa0mm across the shell upon reaching maturity. Unlike some other crab species, the last pair of legs of this crab is flattened into a paddle, hence their name. These paddles are also colored blue, and sometimes have a purple tinge, making them distinctive in color from the rest of the body. Unlike prawns and lobsters which have narrow bodies with long tails, paddle crabs have also developed a wide body (carapace) and very short tail (abdomen), which is usually tucked underneath to its body making it compact and wide.\\n', 'The body of the coconut crab is, like that of all decapods, divided into a front section (cephalothorax), which has 10 legs, and an abdomen. The front-most pair of legs has large chelae (claws), with the left being larger than the right. The next two pairs, as with other hermit crabs, are large, powerful walking legs with pointed tips, which allow coconut crabs to climb vertical or overhanging surfaces. The fourth pair of legs is smaller with tweezer-like chelae at the end, allowing young coconut crabs to grip the inside of a shell or coconut husk to carry for protection; adults use this pair for walking and climbing. The last pair of legs is very small and is used by females to tend their eggs, and by the males in mating. This last pair of legs is usually held inside the carapace, in the cavity containing the breathing organs. Some difference in color occurs between the animals found on different islands, ranging from orange-red to purplish blue; in most regions, blue is the predominant color, but in some places, including the Seychelles, most individuals are red.\\n', 'Like other members of the family, these crabs are easily recognizable due to the complete absence of the last pair of walking legs (pereiopods).
