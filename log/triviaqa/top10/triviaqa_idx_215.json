The Labour Party was seeking a new leader, and several prominent candidates emerged, including Ed Miliband, David Miliband, Ed Balls, and Andy Burnham. Among these candidates, there was one notable female candidate.\n\n1. **Identification of the Female Candidate**:\n   - The only female candidate in this contest was Diane Abbott. Her candidacy was significant as it marked a moment of increased visibility for women in leadership roles within the Labour Party, which had historically seen limited female representation at the highest levels.\n\n2. **Historical Context**:\n   - Prior to Abbott, Margaret Beckett had been the only female Labour MP to stand for the leadership, highlighting the rarity of such occurrences.

The key candidates included Ed Miliband, David Miliband, Ed Balls, Andy Burnham, and Diane Abbott. \n\nFrom the retrieved knowledge, we note the following:\n\n1. **Diane Abbott's Announcement**: According to the passage, Diane Abbott announced her candidacy on May 20, 2010. This is a crucial piece of information that confirms her participation in the contest.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: The passage also mentions that Margaret Beckett was the only female Labour MP to have previously stood for leadership before Abbott. This context highlights the significance of Abbott's candidacy, as it marks a notable moment in the Labour Party's history regarding female representation.\n\n3. **Significance of Representation**: The rarity of female candidates in leadership positions within the Labour Party emphasizes the importance of Abbott's candidacy. This can lead to broader implications regarding gender representation in politics, suggesting that Abbott's participation was not just a personal achievement but also a step forward for female representation in political leadership.\n\n4. **Logical Deduction**: By synthesizing the information, we can deduce that since Abbott was the only female candidate announced in the 2010 contest, she stands out among the male candidates. This reinforces the idea that her candidacy is significant not only for her personal career but also for the representation of women in political leadership roles.\n\n5. **Temporal Reasoning**: Understanding the timeline of events\u2014specifically, that Abbott's candidacy followed Beckett's historical context\u2014allows us to see how past events influence current political dynamics.
