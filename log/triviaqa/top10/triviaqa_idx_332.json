Mommsen's **\"A History of Rome\"** provides a comprehensive overview of Rome's political, social, and cultural developments, particularly focusing on the Roman Republic. In contrast, Gibbon's **\"The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\"** analyzes the factors leading to the decline of the Roman Empire, including military, political, economic, and religious influences.
