While it is commonly believed that the song may have been inspired by a woman named Angela, the most frequently cited surname associated with this belief is \"Bowie,\" referring to Angie Bowie, the wife of musician David Bowie. However, it is crucial to note that both Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, the songwriters, have denied that the song was specifically about Angie Bowie.\n\n1. **Angie Bowie\u2019s Claim**: Angie Bowie has publicly claimed to be the inspiration for the song \"Angie.\" This assertion is significant as it reflects a personal connection that she believes exists between her and the song.\n\n2. **Denial by Songwriters**: Jagger and Richards have consistently denied that the song was written about Angie Bowie. This contradiction highlights the complexity of attributing inspiration to a specific individual.\n\n3. **Keith Richards' Explanation**: In 1993, Keith Richards mentioned that the title \"Angie\" was inspired by his newborn daughter, Dandelion Angela. He later clarified that he chose the name at random while writing the song. This suggests that the name \"Angie\" was not necessarily linked to any particular person, which contradicts the notion that it was specifically about Angie Bowie.\n\n4. **Jagger's Breakup Influence**: Additionally, the lyrics of \"Angie\" were reportedly influenced by Jagger's breakup with Marianne Faithfull. This context provides further insight into the emotional backdrop of the song, indicating that it may not be centered around any one individual.\n\nIn summary, while Angie Bowie claims to be the inspiration for \"Angie,\" this is disputed by the songwriters, who have indicated that the name was chosen randomly and that the song's themes were influenced by personal experiences unrelated to Bowie.
