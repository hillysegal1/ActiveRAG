The English won the first phase, and the treaty granted the English possession of the duchy as a fief independent of France.

For nearly two decades, the French pursued a military policy of avoiding direct battle with the English armies and wearing them down by attrition.

His pursuit of the claim resulted in the Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131453), which pitted five kings of England of the House of Plantagenet against five kings of France of the Capetian House of Valois. Extensive naval raiding was carried out by all sides during the war, often involving privateers such as John Hawley of Dartmouth or the Castilian Pero Ni\u00f1o. Though the English won numerous victories, they were unable to overcome the numerical superiority of the French and their strategic use of gunpowder weapons. England was defeated at the Battle of Formigny in 1450 and finally at the Battle of Castillon in 1453, retaining only a single town in France, Calais.\\n\", \"Up to this point, the succession crisis had been a purely internal affair.

Thus, when rumours reached Philip VI of France that John of Montfort had received English agents, the French Crown naturally took a more direct interest in the situation.

This symbolic act reinforced his assertion and became a significant aspect of the conflict's identity.\n\n5. **Phases of the War**: The Hundred Years' War can be divided into several phases, with the initial phase marked by English victories. However, the conflict evolved over time, leading to shifts in power and strategy, including the eventual resurgence of French forces.\n\n6. **Military Strategies and Key Events**: The war saw various military strategies employed by both sides, including naval power and innovative tactics. Notable events, such as the Battle of Sluys in 1340, established English dominance in the English Channel. Despite early successes, the English faced challenges and ultimately lost most of their territorial gains by 1453, retaining only Calais.\n\n7. **Long-term Consequences**: The Hundred Years' War had lasting effects on both England and France, shaping national identities and leading to changes in military organization and governance. The conflict also set the stage for future political developments in both nations.\n\nBy synthesizing this information, we can appreciate the complexity of Edward III's claim and its implications. His actions in 1337 were not merely about asserting a title; they were part of a broader narrative involving familial ties, political dynamics, and military strategies that would shape the course of European history.\n\n### Answer:\nEdward III of England claimed the throne of France in 1337, precipitating the 'Hundred Years War'. His claim was rooted in his lineage as the grandson of Philip IV of France, and it arose from a succession crisis following the death of the last Capetian king.

The war was fought over the succession to the French throne and involved multiple kings from both England and France, with Edward III's claim symbolized by quartering the royal arms of England with the Arms of France."}], "question_info": {"question": "In 1337 which English king claimed the throne of France, precipitating the '100 Years War'?", "passages": ["In 1369 the French government repudiated the 1360 Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny, resuming the Hundred Years' War between the kingdom of France and the kingdom of England and their various allies. The war originated over the King of England's status as both a French duke and also an English king, creating conflicting interests in many of his actions. The French had declared the English duchy in southwestern France forfeit, beginning the war. The English won the first phase, and the treaty granted the English possession of the duchy as a fief independent of France. During the ensuing decade of peace, the French government strengthened and determined to establish control over the duchy. For nearly two decades, the French pursued a military policy of avoiding direct battle with the English armies and wearing them down by attrition. Although the English won a few victories, eventually almost all of their gains from the earlier phases of the war were lost, including all of the Duchy of Aquitaine except for a narrow coastal strip from Bordeaux to the border of Navarre.\n", "BULLET::::- 1338 Edward III claims the throne of France, initiating the Hundred Years' War\n", "BULLET::::- 3 June \u2013 Hundred Years' War: Edward III once again formally claims the throne of France.\n", "In 1340, following the extinction of the House of Capet, Edward III claimed the French throne. In addition to initiating the Hundred Years' War, Edward III expressed his claim in heraldic form by quartering the royal arms of England with the Arms of France. This quartering continued until 1801, with intervals in 1360\u20131369 and 1420\u20131422.\n", "Edward III was the first English king to have a claim to the throne of France. His pursuit of the claim resulted in the Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131453), which pitted five kings of England of the House of Plantagenet against five kings of France of the Capetian House of Valois. Extensive naval raiding was carried out by all sides during the war, often involving privateers such as John Hawley of Dartmouth or the Castilian Pero Ni\u00f1o. Though the English won numerous victories, they were unable to overcome the numerical superiority of the French and their strategic use of gunpowder weapons. England was defeated at the Battle of Formigny in 1450 and finally at the Battle of Castillon in 1453, retaining only a single town in France, Calais.\n", "Up to this point, the succession crisis had been a purely internal affair. But to complicate things further, the Hundred Years' War between England and France had broken out four years earlier, in 1337. In 1341, there was truce between the two countries, but there was little doubt that hostilities would be renewed when the truce ended in June 1342. Thus, when rumours reached Philip VI of France that John of Montfort had received English agents, the French Crown naturally took a more direct interest in the situation. Charles of Blois became the official French candidate. Whatever had been his original intentions, John of Montfort was now forced to support Edward III of England as King of France.\n", "The Hundred Years' War in the 14th and 15th\u00a0centuries was fought between the kings of England and France over the succession to the French throne. The war ended in 1453 when the English were finally ejected from France, but in the early 15th\u00a0century the English under King Henry\u00a0V made significant territorial gains. The Treaty of Troyes in 1420 made Henry\u00a0V the heir apparent to the French throne but when the French king, Charles\u00a0VI, and Henry\u00a0V died in the space of two months in 1422 the issue of succession was again uncertain. The English supported Henry\u00a0V's son, Henry\u00a0VI who was still a child, while the French supported recognised Charles\u00a0VII, the Dauphin of France. Between 1427 and 1450 Ch\u00e2teau de Chinon was the residence of Charles, when Touraine was virtually the only territory left to him in France, the rest being occupied by the Burgundians or the English.\n", "From 1340 to 1360, and from 1369 on, the King of England assumed the title of \"King of France\"; but although England was generally successful in its war with France, no attempt was made to make the title a reality during that period of time.\n", "BULLET::::- 1431 \u2013 Hundred Years' War: Henry VI of England is crowned King of France at Notre Dame in Paris.\n", "Europe entered a period which saw almost continuous war for the next century. Fighting took place in the Duchy of Brittany, \"a country well suited to guerilla warfare\", from 1342\u20131365 in the Breton War of Succession. The Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131453) between France and England continued, and Edward III led an invasion resulting in a number of victories. One of the earlier English victories was at the naval Battle of Sluys in 1340, which annihilated the French fleet and gave the English control of the English Channel for several years. The initial campaigns were frustrating and expensive, so Edward altered his strategy to use English armies that were lightly supported but prepared to forage off the land. It successfully established English control over Brittany in 1342. Further armies were sent to Brittany and Gascony in 1345, and Edward himself crossed the Channel in 1346 with 10,000 men \u2014 an enormous army by contemporary standards. They plundered Caen, an important town in Normandy, and eventually began moving back toward the Channel.\n"], "__answers__": ["Edward III of England", "Edward III of England", "Edward III of England", "Edward III", "Edward III", "Edward III", "Edward III", "King Edward III of England", "King Edward III of England", "King Edward III", "Edward III (England)", "Edward 3", "Edward the Third", "King Edward III of Windsor", "edward of windsor", "eduard iii", "king edward iii", "edward iii england", "edward third", "Edward III Plantagenet", "Edward III, King of England", "King of England III", "Edward iii", "edward 3", "Eduard III", "king edward iii of windsor", "Edward of Windsor", "edward iii plantagenet of windsor", "edward iii plantagenet", "Edward III of Windsor", "Edward III, King of the English", "Edward iii of england", "EDWARD III", "king of england iii", "edward iii king of england", "king edward iii of england", "edward iii of windsor", "edward iii", "Edward III Plantagenet of Windsor", "edward iii king of english", "edward iii of england"]}}
