Since 19 June 2014, the title has been reserved for Felipe's daughter Leonor, Princess of Asturias, as heiress presumptive to the Spanish crown.\n", "As with other Spanish noble titles, the dukedom of Luna descended according to cognatic primogeniture, meaning that females could inherit the title if they had no brothers (or if their brothers had no issue). That changed in 2006, since when the eldest child (regardless of gender) automatically succeeds to noble family titles.\n", "The end of this dynasty is in dispute. Some historians consider that the House of Arag\u00f3n was extinguished when Ramiro II of Aragon died without male descent, and that later holders of this crown should be called members of the House of Barcelona. However, the marriage provisions of his daughter Petronila say that her husband was never given the title of king, their descendants used both titles, King of Aragon and Count of Barcelona equally. Although the total loss of the Count's family rights and dominions in Occitania, the title of King of Aragon was not prominent until the Trastamara Dynasty was crowned and the monarchs called themselves just \"de Aragon\" (of Aragon).\n"], "__answers__": ["Infante", "infanta of le\u00f3n", "infantes", "Infante of Spain", "infante of spain", "Infanta", "infanta of spain", "Infanta of Le\u00f3n", "infanta infante", "infante", "Infantes", "Infanta of Castile", "infanta of castile", "infanta de castile", "Infanta Infante", "Infanta of Spain", "Infanta de Castile", "infanta"]}}
