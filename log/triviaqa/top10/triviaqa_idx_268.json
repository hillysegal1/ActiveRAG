The border lands of Egypt's province of Caanan with Kadesh are defined in the Gardiner translation p.\u00a019.\n", "Northern Canaan (in modern terms Lebanon, the Mediterranean coast of Syria, and far south-west coast of Turkey) remained inhabited by Canaanite-speaking peoples and was not a part of Aramea. These Canaanites coalesced into city states such as Tyre, Sidon, Berytus, Arvad, Simyra, Onoba and Tarshish. The term Phoenicia was applied to this region, but it is a later Greek application which was not used during the Assyrian period.\n", "From the mid 14th century BC through to the 11th century BC, much of Canaan (particularly the north, central and eastern regions of Syria and the north western Mediterranean coastal regions) fell to the Middle Assyrian Empire, and both Egyptian and Hittite influence waned as a result. Powerful Assyrian kings extracted tribute from Canaanite states and cities from north, east and central Syria as far as the Mediterranean.\n", "During the 2nd millennium BC, Ancient Egyptian texts use the term \"Canaan\" to refer to an Egyptian-ruled colony, whose boundaries generally corroborate the definition of Canaan found in the Hebrew Bible, bounded to the west by the Mediterranean Sea, to the north in the vicinity of Hamath in Syria, to the east by the Jordan Valley, and to the south by a line extended from the Dead Sea to around Gaza. Nevertheless, the Egyptian and Hebrew uses of the term are not identical: the Egyptian texts also identify the coastal city of Qadesh in north west Syria near Turkey as part of the \"Land of Canaan\", so that the Egyptian usage seems to refer to the entire Levantine coast of the Mediterranean Sea, making it a synonym of another Egyptian term for this coastland, Retjenu.\n", "In ancient times, the Greeks called the whole of Canaan \"Phoin\u00edk\u0113\", literally \"[land] of the purple[-producing shell]\". Today, general consensus associates the Phoenician homeland proper with the northwest coastal region of the Levant, centered at Phoenician cities such as Ugarit, Tyre, Sidon, and Byblos. Today, this place is usually equated with modern Lebanon and the coast of modern Syria. Also there is a modern town in Turkey called \"Finike\" which is thought to have derived by the Lycians who traded with Phoenicians in ancient times.\n", "According to the Table of Nations in Genesis 10 (verses 15-19), Canaan was the ancestor of the tribes who originally occupied the ancient Land of Canaan: all the territory from Sidon or Hamath in the north to Gaza in the southwest and Lasha in the southeast. This territory, known as the Levant, is roughly the areas of modern-day Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, western Jordan, and western Syria. Canaan's firstborn son was Sidon, who shares his name with the Phoenician city of Sidon in present-day Lebanon. His second son was Heth. Canaan's descendants, according to the Hebrew Bible, include:\n", "The Egyptian geographical term \"Retjenu\", is traditionally identified as an area covering Sinai and Canaan south of Lebanon, with the regions of Amurru and Apu to the north. And as such, parts of Canaan and southwestern Syria became tributary to the Egyptian Pharaohs in the early Late Bronze Age. When Canaanite confederacies centered on Megiddo and Kadesh, came under the control of the Egyptian Empire. However, the empire's control was sporadic, and not strong enough to prevent frequent local rebellions and inter-city conflict.\n", "The early history of the territory is unclear. Modern archaeology has largely discarded the historicity of the narrative in the Torah concerning the patriarchs, The Exodus, and the conquest of Canaan described in the Book of Joshua, and instead views the narrative as constituting the Israelites' national myth. During the Late Bronze Age (1550\u20131200 BCE), large parts of Canaan formed vassal states paying tribute to the New Kingdom of Egypt, whose administrative headquarters lay in Gaza. Ancestors of the Israelites are thought to have included ancient Semitic-speaking peoples native to this area. The Israelites and their culture, according to the modern archaeological account, did not overtake the region by force, but instead branched out of these Canaanite peoples and their cultures through the development of a distinct monolatristic\u2014and later monotheistic\u2014religion centered on Yahweh. The archaeological evidence indicates a society of village-like centres, but with more limited resources and a small population. Villages had populations of up to 300 or 400, which lived by farming and herding, and were largely self-sufficient; economic interchange was prevalent. Writing was known and available for recording, even in small sites.\n"], "__answers__": ["Phoenicians", "Phoenicians", "Phoenicians", "Phoenicia", "Phoenicia", "Phoenicia", "phoenecians", "phonicia", "ph\u0153nicia", "Phonecia", "kinahna", "Phoin\u00edk\u0113", "f\u012bn\u012bq\u012byah", "ph\u0153nicians", "fenicia", "Phoenician Chronology", "Phoinikia", "Foreign relations of Phoenicia", "foenicia", "phoenicia", "Fenicia", "phenicia", "Phoenecian", "phonicians", "Phenicia", "phoenic\u00ea", "Ph\u0153nicia", "F\u012bn\u012bq\u012byah", "Phonicians", "phenice", "Kinahna", "Phoenician people", "phoinikia", "phoenician art", "phonecia", "phoenician people", "foreign relations of phoenicia", "Phoenecians", "Phocae", "Foenicia", "Phonicia", "phoenician civilization", "Phoenician chronology", "Ph\u0153nicians", "phoenecian", "phoenicians", "Phoenic\u00ea", "phoin\u00edk\u0113", "phocae", "phoenician chronology", "phonecian", "Phonecian", "Phenice", "Phoenician civilization", "Phoenician art"]}}
