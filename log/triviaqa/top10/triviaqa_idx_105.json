The result was successful. The drink is distilled now at Loven industrial area in Tilburg by the Eindhoven company Schrobbeler Ltd, without the \u00e8 on the last vowel. The drink is especially consumed at Carnival. The name is derived from the profession of 'Schrobbelaar', in the textile industry in Tilburg. The profession was unskilled and had a low wage.\n", "According to the Scotch Whisky Association, Scotch whisky evolved from a Scottish drink called \"uisge beatha\", which means \"water of life\". The earliest record of distillation in Scotland occurred as long ago as 1494, as documented in the \"Exchequer Rolls\", which were records of royal income and expenditure. The quote above records eight bolls of malt given to Friar John Cor wherewith to make aqua vitae (Latin for \"water of life,\" = \"uisge beatha\") over the previous year. This would be enough for 1,500 bottles, which suggests that distillation was well-established by the late 15th century.\n", "Distilled spirit was generally flavored with juniper berries. The resulting beverage was known as jenever, the Dutch word for \"juniper.\" The French changed the name to genievre, which the English changed to \"geneva\" and then modified to \"gin.\" Originally used for medicinal purposes, the use of gin as a social drink did not grow rapidly at first. However, in 1690, England passed \"An Act for the Encouraging of the Distillation of Brandy and Spirits from Corn\" and within four years the annual production of distilled spirits, most of which was gin, reached nearly one million gallons. \"Corn\" in the British English of the time meant \"grain\" in general, while in American English \"corn\" refers principally to maize.\n"], "__answers__": ["Vodka", "Wodka (disambiguation)", "Balkan 176\u00b0", "balkan 176deg", "vodka", "vodak", "Wodka", "Vodka and Coke", "Vokda", "blackcurrant vodka", "filtering vodka", "\u0412\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0430", "Vodak", "Filtering vodka", "balkan 176\u00b0", "Blackcurrant vodka", "vokda", "vodka and coke", "Russian vodka", "Balkan 176deg", "russian vodka", "wodka", "wodka disambiguation", "\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0430"]}}
