The character Doralee Rhodes is one of these leads.\n\nFrom my knowledge, the film starred Dolly Parton, Jane Fonda, and Lily Tomlin. Among these, Dolly Parton is particularly notable not only for her acting but also for her successful career as a singer and songwriter. Given that Doralee Rhodes is a character portrayed by Dolly Parton, I can conclude that she is the actress/singer in question.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to recognize that the character Doralee Rhodes has been portrayed by other actresses in adaptations, such as Rachel Dennison in the ABC television sitcom version of \"9 to 5.\" This context helps to understand the character's evolution and the cultural impact of the original film. \n\nBy establishing that Dolly Parton originated the role, I can also infer that her performance set a standard for how the character is perceived in later adaptations. This causal relationship between the original portrayal and subsequent interpretations enhances my understanding of the character's significance in popular culture.\n\nThus, my reasoning leads me to conclude that Dolly Parton is not only the original actress for this role but also a significant cultural figure whose portrayal has influenced how Doralee Rhodes is represented in various adaptations.\n\n### Answer:\nDolly Parton"}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\n\"Which actress/singer starred as Doralee Rhodes in the 1980 film, \"\"Nine to Five\"\"?\"\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['BULLET::::- Doralee Rhodes, fictional character in \"Nine to Five\"\\n', 'In September 2018, it was announced that McQueen would play the leading role of Doralee Rhodes in the first West End run of Broadway musical \"9 to 5\", a character originally played by Dolly Parton in the 1980s film of the same name.\\n', 'DeGarmo played the role of Doralee Rhodes in the national tour of \"9 to 5\", which was launched in Nashville on September 21, 2010.
