This agreement was signed in 1985 by five founding EU member states (Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany) and has since expanded to include 22 EU countries and 4 non-EU countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland).\n\n2. **Mechanism of the Agreement**:\n   - The Schengen Agreement facilitates free movement across borders by allowing individuals to travel without the need for passport checks at internal borders. This has significantly enhanced the ease of travel and trade within the Schengen Area, contributing to the establishment of a single market.\n\n3. **Historical Context and Evolution**:\n   - The Schengen Agreement emerged from a need to streamline border control policies among European nations, especially in light of increasing integration and cooperation within the EU. It is important to note that while the Nordic Passport Union also abolished passport controls among its member states (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and later Iceland), it operates independently of the Schengen framework and primarily affects the Nordic countries.\n\n4. **Impact of External Factors**:\n   - The Schengen Area has faced challenges, such as the temporary re-imposition of border controls in response to crises (e.g., the migrant crisis). These events highlight the dynamic nature of border control policies and the need for flexibility in response to changing circumstances.\n\n5. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - The signing of the Schengen Agreement directly correlates with the abolition of passport checks among member states, demonstrating a clear causal relationship. This understanding allows for a deeper analysis of how agreements can shape policies and influence the movement of people across borders.\n\n6. **Comparative Analysis**:\n   - By comparing the Schengen Agreement with other agreements, such as the Nordic Passport Union, we can gain insights into different approaches to border control and the varying degrees of freedom of movement they provide. This comparative perspective enhances the model's ability to reason about the effectiveness and implications of different policies.\n\n### Answer:\nThe agreement under which passport controls have been abolished in 22 EU and 4 non-EU states is known as the **Schengen Agreement**."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nWhat is the name of the agreement under which passport controls have been abolished in 22 EU and 4 non-EU states?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The Nordic Passport Union was established in three stages.
