His \"Anabasis\" chronicles the journey of the \"Army of the Ten Thousand,\" a group of Greek mercenaries who sought to return home after the failed campaign of Cyrus the Younger against his brother, King Artaxerxes II.\n   - **Arrian**: A later historian from the second century AD, known for his work \"Anabasis of Alexander,\" which details the campaigns of Alexander the Great.\n\n3. **Content and Structure**:\n   - **Xenophon\u2019s Anabasis**: This work is composed of seven books and is often referred to as \"The March of the Ten Thousand.\" It provides a first-hand account of the challenges faced by the mercenaries as they navigated hostile territories after their leader's defeat at the Battle of Cunaxa in 401 BC. The narrative emphasizes themes of leadership, camaraderie, and the human spirit in the face of adversity.\n   - **Arrian\u2019s Anabasis**: Also structured in seven books, this work focuses on Alexander's military conquests and strategies, reflecting Arrian's admiration for Alexander as a military leader. It serves as a historical account that builds on earlier sources, including Xenophon\u2019s narrative.\n\n4. **Literary and Historical Significance**: Both works are foundational texts in classical literature and history. They are frequently studied for their narrative style and historical insights. Xenophon\u2019s work is particularly valued for its personal perspective and clarity, while Arrian\u2019s is recognized for its comprehensive portrayal of Alexander\u2019s campaigns.\n\n5. **Cultural and Educational Impact**: The term \"Anabasis\" has broader implications in literature and history, symbolizing the journey of self-discovery and the trials of leadership. Both texts are often among the first studied by students of ancient Greek due to their engaging narratives and clear prose.\n\n6. **Comparative Analysis**: Understanding the differences between the two \"Anabasis\" works enriches the comprehension of military history and narrative techniques in ancient literature. Xenophon\u2019s account is more introspective, while Arrian\u2019s is grander and more focused on the legendary figure of Alexander.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: By distinguishing between the two authors and their respective works, one gains a deeper insight into the evolution of historical writing in ancient Greece. Xenophon\u2019s original narrative serves as a precursor to Arrian\u2019s later historical account, illustrating the interwoven nature of literary and historical traditions.\n\n### Answer:\nThe author of the \"Anabasis\" that details the journey of the Ten Thousand is Xenophon."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nWhich classical author wrote the Anabasis?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The Anabasis of Alexander (, \"Alex\u00e1ndrou An\u00e1basis\"; ) was composed by Arrian of Nicomedia in the second century AD, most probably during the reign of Hadrian.
