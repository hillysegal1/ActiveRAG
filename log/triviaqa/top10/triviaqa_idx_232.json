Initially, Moctezuma welcomed Cort\u00e9s and his men, believing them to be divine or fulfilling a prophecy. However, this initial hospitality turned into a power struggle.\n\n1. **Moctezuma II's Capture**: On November 14, 1519, Cort\u00e9s seized Moctezuma II, effectively taking him hostage. This act was pivotal as it allowed Cort\u00e9s to exert influence over the Aztec leadership and manipulate the political situation to his advantage.\n\n2. **Deposition of Moctezuma**: While Cort\u00e9s was away from Tenochtitlan dealing with other Spanish forces, the Aztec ruling council, feeling threatened and betrayed, voted to depose Moctezuma. They elected his brother, Cuitlahuac, as the new emperor. This change in leadership illustrates the erosion of Moctezuma's authority and the growing resistance against the Spanish.\n\n3. **Circumstances of Moctezuma's Death**: The circumstances surrounding Moctezuma's death are complex. He was struck by a stone during a confrontation with his own people, who were angry at his perceived collaboration with the Spanish. The ambiguity of whether he died from his injuries or was killed by the Spanish adds layers to the narrative of his deposition.\n\n4. **Cuitlahuac's Brief Reign**: After Moctezuma's deposition, Cuitlahuac took over but ruled for a very short period (40 to 80 days). His leadership was marked by efforts to rally the Aztecs against the Spanish, indicating a shift in the power dynamics and the urgency of resistance.\n\n5. **Impact of Cort\u00e9s's Actions**: Cort\u00e9s's actions, including the violent suppression of Aztec nobility by his lieutenant Pedro de Alvarado, contributed to the breakdown of Aztec authority and the eventual fall of Tenochtitlan.

Cort\u00e9s arrived in 1519, during which Moctezuma II was the reigning emperor of the Aztec Empire. Initially, Moctezuma welcomed Cort\u00e9s and his men, believing them to be representatives of the god Quetzalcoatl. However, this initial hospitality quickly turned into a power struggle.\n\nCort\u00e9s captured Moctezuma II on November 14, 1519, effectively taking him hostage. This act was crucial as it destabilized the Aztec leadership and created a power vacuum. While Cort\u00e9s was away dealing with other Spanish forces, tensions escalated within Tenochtitlan, leading to a massacre of Aztec nobles by Pedro de Alvarado, which incited further conflict and resentment among the Aztecs.\n\nAs the situation deteriorated, the Aztec ruling council decided to depose Moctezuma II, electing his brother Cuitlahuac as the new emperor. Moctezuma's death followed shortly after, under circumstances that remain unclear\u2014whether he was killed by his own people or died from injuries inflicted during the conflict.\n\nCuitlahuac's reign was brief, lasting only about 40 to 80 days, as he succumbed to smallpox. He was succeeded by Cuauht\u00e9moc, who became the last emperor of the Aztecs and led the resistance against the Spanish until the fall of Tenochtitlan in 1521.\n\nThe consequences of these events were profound, leading to the collapse of the Aztec Empire and its incorporation into the Spanish Empire. Cort\u00e9s's actions not only altered the political landscape but also had lasting cultural implications, as the Spanish imposed their religion and governance on the indigenous population.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe deposition of Moctezuma II by Cort\u00e9s is a pivotal moment in the history of the Aztec Empire, illustrating the fragility of indigenous leadership in the face of European conquest. Understanding this context enhances our comprehension of the complexities involved in the Spanish conquest and its lasting impact on Mesoamerica.\n\n### Answer:\nMoctezuma II was the Aztec ruler who was deposed by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nWhich Aztec ruler was deposed by Cortez?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['On 14 November 1519, Cortes seized the emperor Moctezuma II and ordered the destruction of all the religious relics of the Aztecs.

The Spaniards were trapped between two Aztec forces and 68 were captured alive. Ten of these Spanish captives were immediately sacrificed at the Temple and their severed heads were thrown back to the Spaniards. The others were sacrificed at the Great Temple that night, which could be seen from the Spanish camps.

Cort\u00e9s arrived in Mexico in 1519 and eventually led an expedition that resulted in the fall of the Aztec Empire. The ruler of the Aztecs at that time was Moctezuma II.

This suggests that Moctezuma was not directly deposed by Cort\u00e9s but rather by the Aztec council during a time of crisis.\n\n2. **Moctezuma's Death**: The circumstances surrounding Moctezuma's death are unclear. Some passages suggest he was killed by an Aztec soldier after being struck with a sling stone, while others imply that he may have died from injuries inflicted by the Spanish or that he was no longer of use to them.

Moctezuma initially welcomed Cort\u00e9s and his men, believing them to be representatives of the god Quetzalcoatl.\n\n2. **Moctezuma's Captivity**: As tensions escalated, Cort\u00e9s took Moctezuma captive in Tenochtitlan. This act was pivotal in the Spanish conquest, as it undermined the authority of the Aztec ruler.\n\n3. **Deposition by the Council**: While Cort\u00e9s played a significant role in Moctezuma's capture, it is crucial to note that Moctezuma was ultimately deposed by the Aztec ruling council. During Cort\u00e9s's absence from Tenochtitlan, the council voted to remove Moctezuma from power and elected his brother, Cuitlahuac, as the new emperor. This indicates that the deposition was a decision made by the Aztec leadership rather than a direct action by Cort\u00e9s.\n\n4. **Moctezuma's Death**: The circumstances surrounding Moctezuma's death are ambiguous. Some accounts suggest he was killed by an Aztec soldier during a confrontation with the Spanish, while others imply he may have died from injuries inflicted by the Spanish or due to the political turmoil. This uncertainty highlights the complexity of the events leading to his death.\n\n5. **Cuitlahuac's Short Reign**: After Moctezuma, Cuitlahuac ruled for a brief period (between 40 and 80 days) before dying of smallpox. His short reign reflects the instability of leadership during the conquest.\n\n6. **Cuauht\u00e9moc's Ascendancy**: Following Cuitlahuac's death, Cuauht\u00e9moc became the last Aztec ruler. His leadership marked the final resistance against the Spanish conquest.\n\n7. **Cort\u00e9s's Role**: While Cort\u00e9s was instrumental in the conquest, the actual deposition of Moctezuma was a result of internal Aztec political decisions, emphasizing the need to clarify the distinction between Cort\u00e9s's actions and the agency of the Aztec rulers.\n\nIn summary, the enhanced reasoning process clarifies that:\n- Moctezuma II was deposed by the Aztec ruling council, not directly by Cort\u00e9s.\n- The exact circumstances of Moctezuma's death remain unclear, with various accounts suggesting different causes.\n- Cuitlahuac succeeded Moctezuma but ruled for a very short time before dying of smallpox.\n- Cuauht\u00e9moc became the last Aztec ruler after Cuitlahuac's death.\n\n**Answer:** Moctezuma II was deposed by the Aztec ruling council, not directly by Cort\u00e9s, who had taken him captive."}], "question_info": {"question": "Which Aztec ruler was deposed by Cortez?", "passages": ["On 14 November 1519, Cortes seized the emperor Moctezuma II and ordered the destruction of all the religious relics of the Aztecs. He ordered a Catholic cross placed on the Templo Mayor. While Cortes left for Veracruz to confront Spaniards looking to arrest him, Pedro de Alvarado learned of a plan to attack the Spaniards, and staged a pre-emptive attack on the Aztecs in the Sacred Precinct while they celebrated a religious festival. Unarmed and trapped within the walls of the Sacred Precinct, an estimated 8,000\u201310,000 Aztec nobles were killed. When word of the massacre spread throughout the city, the people turned on the Spaniards, killing seven, wounding many, and driving the rest back to their quarters. The Spaniards were trapped between two Aztec forces and 68 were captured alive. Ten of these Spanish captives were immediately sacrificed at the Temple and their severed heads were thrown back to the Spaniards. The others were sacrificed at the Great Temple that night, which could be seen from the Spanish camps. The sacrificed Spaniards were flayed and their faces \u2014 with beards attached \u2014 were tanned and sent to allied towns, both to solicit assistance and to warn against betraying the alliance.\n", "Believing that Cort\u00e9s had perished (or at least claiming to believe it), Salazar and Alm\u00edndez then ousted Zuazo on May 23, 1525, and began a tyrannical and criminal government. They began confiscating the property of Cort\u00e9s and the conquistadors who had accompanied him.\n", "While Cort\u00e9s was away from Tenochtitlan dealing with Narv\u00e1ez, his second in command Pedro de Alvarado massacred a group of Aztec nobility in response to a ritual of human sacrifice honoring Huitzilopochtli. The Aztecs retaliated by attacking the palace where the Spanish were quartered. Cort\u00e9s returned to Tenochtitlan and fought his way to the palace. He then took Motecuzoma up to the roof of the palace to ask his subjects to stand down. However, by this point the ruling council of Tenochtitlan had voted to depose Motecuzoma and had elected his brother Cuitlahuac as the new emperor. One of the Aztec soldiers struck Motecuzoma in the head with a sling stone, and he died several days later \u2013 although the exact details of his death, particularly who was responsible, are unclear.\n", "In 1519, the Spanish took Moctezuma, Cacamatzin (ruler of Texcoco), Cuitlahuac and other nobles as prisoners. Cort\u00e9s was then forced to return to Veracruz to face Spanish authorities, leaving Pedro de Alvarado in charge. Alvarado had hundreds of Aztec nobles killed. After Cort\u00e9s returned, he liberated Cuitl\u00e1huac in exchange for supplies, allowing the lord to organize an army against the Spanish. Cuitlahuac succeeded Moctezuma as Aztec emperor and forced the Spanish to flee during the Noche Triste. However, Cuitlahuac was ruler only somewhere between 40 and 80 days according to various records. He spent that time repairing the city of Tenochtitlan as the Spanish regrouped in Tlaxcala. Cuitlahuac died of smallpox in December 1520, with Cuauht\u00e9moc succeeding him.\n", "During Cort\u00e9s' absence, Pedro de Alvarado in Tenochtitlan obtained information that the Aztecs were planning to attack him. In response, de Alvarado ordered a preemptive slaughter of Aztec nobles and priests celebrating a festival in the city's main temple. In retaliation, the Aztecs laid siege to the Spanish compound, in which Moctezuma was still being held captive. By the time Cort\u00e9s returned to Tenochtitlan in late June, the Aztecs had elected a new Hueyi Tlatoani named Cuitl\u00e1huac.\n", "While Cort\u00e9s was gone, Alvarado imprisoned two important Aztec leaders and killed several others. Tensions exploded when Alvarado ordered a massacre during the spring festival of Huizilopochtli. When Cort\u00e9s returned in June 1520 the situation was dire. Communications and entrances to the city were cut off. The Spanish outside the city had no food supplies and a severe shortage of drinking water. Cort\u00e9s had Moctezuma try to pacify his people by speaking to them from the palace, but the emperor was greeted with a storm of stones and arrows, wounding him badly. Moctezuma died a short time later, but whether he died from his injuries or whether the Spanish killed him, seeing that he was no longer of use to them, is unknown. The news of Moctezuma's death caused uproar in the city. The Spanish tried to flee unnoticed but were caught.

The first decree directed that they join the already-formed government of Estrada, Albornoz and Zuazo as its fourth and fifth members, provided that the two groups could reconcile their differences.
