This version of Robin is depicted as the protector of Bl\u00fcdhaven - the city he fights crime in the comics as Nightwing - but he is dressed in the yellow bodysuit, not the grey Batman based suit as shown in Justice League of America (Vol 1) #55, of the adult Robin of Pre Crisis Earth-Two. The rift between him and Batman has already taken place, and he is seen to still be angry at Batman for still treating him as a sidekick rather than a superhero in his own right. It is only after cooperating with Batman to defeat Crazy Quilt does Robin earn Batman's respect. After Crazy Quilt was defeated, Robin joined Batman when Killer Moth hijacks the Gotham Bank Money Train, but he rides in the side cart of Batman's motorcycle (something he stated he never wanted to do again). Robin was voiced by Crawford Wilson.\n", "In \"\" (2008\u20132011), Batman wears a slightly modified version of the blue and gray suit worn during the Silver Age comics from the 1960s and 1970s. The batsuit also resembles the \"New Look\" costume. According to the show's creators, this was deliberately done to invoke a less dark and violent depiction of Batman following the release of \"The Dark Knight\".\n", "Michael Cera voices Dick Grayson in \"The Lego Movie\" spin-off \"The Lego Batman Movie\". This version was adopted by Batman as a teenager and his Robin outfit is actually a modified Reggae outfit for Batman with the pants taken off. He has large, green glasses similar to the Carrie Kelley version. During the climax, he briefly dons a Batman armor labeled \"Nightwing\" when attempting to save Barbara and Alfred.\n", "Batman's cape, cowl, gloves, briefs, and boots are usually either black or dark blue with the body of the costume being grey. Originally the suit was conceived as being black and grey, but due to coloring schemes of early comic books, the black was highlighted with blue. Hence, over the years the black cape and cowl appeared as dark blue in the comic books. Thus artists' renditions depict the costume as both black and grey or blue and grey.\n", "In attempting to present the character as a figurative mirror to Batman, the costume worn by Anarky in \"Beware the Batman\" was radically redesigned as entirely white, in contrast to Batman's black Batsuit. It consists of a tightly worn jumpsuit, cape, hood, flexible mask with white-eye lenses, and a utility belt. Upon the chest is a small, stylized circle-A in black. The design was negatively compared by reviewers to the longstanding design for Moon Knight, a Marvel Comics superhero.\n"], "__answers__": ["Yellow", "Yellowest", "Symbolism of yellow", "White yellow", "yellowy", "(255, 255, 0)", "Yellower", "yellowishly", "Yellow color", "yellower", "Yelow", "royal yellow", "symbolism of yellow", "Yellowishly", "yellow colour", "yellowwhite", "Royal yellow", "Yellow (color)", "white yellow", "Yellow white", "yellow color", "yellow white", "dark yellow", "Yellowy", "Yellow-white", "yellow", "Whiteyellow", "whiteyellow", "yelow", "Rgb(255, 255, 0)", "Dark yellow", "Yellow (Colour)", "Yellow (colour)", "White-yellow", "255 255 0", "rgb 255 255 0", "yellowishness", "yellowest", "Yellowishness", "Yellowwhite"]}}
