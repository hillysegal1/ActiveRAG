However, the absence of this information could lead to an incomplete understanding of Cambodia's vehicle registration system.\n\nTo alleviate model illusions and improve the accuracy of the model's responses, it would be beneficial to include the correct International Vehicle Registration code for Cambodia, which is \"CB.\" This addition would ensure that the model has comprehensive and accurate information regarding vehicle registration in Cambodia. \n\nIn summary, the model should be updated with the IVR code for Cambodia (\"CB\") to prevent factual errors and enhance its knowledge base.\nPlease verify the above reasoning process for errors, \nthen enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to update the language model's knowledge, prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions.\nAfterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n\nGeneration Format:\nknowledge enhanced inference process:\nAnswer:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Knowledge Enhanced Inference Process:**\n\nTo determine the International Vehicle Registration (IVR) code for Cambodia, we need to refer to the international standards that designate vehicle registration codes for countries.
