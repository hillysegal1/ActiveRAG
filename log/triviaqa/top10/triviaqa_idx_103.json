The passages focus on Wilkinson's career achievements and notable moments, particularly his performance in the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final, but they do not mention the shirt number he wore in 2011.\n\nHowever, based on general knowledge of rugby union, Jonny Wilkinson is primarily known as a fly-half, a position typically associated with the number 10 jersey. While it is reasonable to infer that he would have worn this number during the 2011 World Cup, it is crucial to recognize that this inference is based on positional norms rather than explicit evidence from the retrieved passages.\n\nGiven that the model may have existing knowledge that Jonny Wilkinson played in the 2011 World Cup, it is important to clarify that while he is likely to have worn the number 10 shirt, this is not definitively confirmed by the retrieved information.
