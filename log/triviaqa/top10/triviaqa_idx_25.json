Guillermo Endara emerged as a prominent candidate in these elections, running against Carlos Duque, who was backed by Noriega. Endara's victory was significant, as he reportedly won by a margin of nearly three-to-one. However, the existing government, led by Noriega, annulled the election results shortly after, claiming \"foreign interference\" as the justification for this action. This annulment was met with widespread international condemnation, particularly from the United States and various election observers, including the Catholic Church and former President Jimmy Carter, who recognized Endara's victory despite the annulment.\n\nThe situation escalated following the elections, as Endara faced violence and intimidation from Noriega's supporters. The U.S. government, which had provided substantial financial support to Endara's campaign, began to increase its military presence in Panama, ultimately leading to a military invasion on December 20, 1989. This invasion was framed as a necessary action to restore democracy and protect U.S. interests, particularly regarding the Panama Canal.\n\nAfter the invasion, Panama's Electoral Tribunal invalidated the annulment of the May 1989 election on December 27, 1989, confirming Endara's victory and allowing him to be sworn in as president. This sequence of events highlights the complexities of electoral politics in authoritarian regimes and the role of international actors in influencing domestic governance.\n\nThe events surrounding the May 1989 elections in Panama serve as a critical case study in understanding the dynamics of democracy, authoritarianism, and foreign intervention. They illustrate the challenges faced by democratic movements in the face of oppressive regimes and the potential consequences of electoral fraud. Additionally, they underscore the significance of international observers in legitimizing electoral processes and the impact of U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War era.\n\n### Answer:\nPanama"}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nIn which country were democratic elections held in May 1989, and though Guillermo Endara was elected president, the results were annulled by the existing government?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['National elections of May 1989 were marred by accusations of fraud from both sides.

The U.S. government gave $10 million to the Endara campaign. The election results were annulled by the Panamanian Government on May 10, due to what Noriega called \"foreign interference.\" However, a tally organized by the anti-Noriega alliance showed Endara beating Noriega\\'s puppet candidate, Carlos Duque, by a nearly 3-to-1 margin.

Endara was physically assaulted by Noriega supporters the next day in his motorcade. Noriega declared the election null and maintained power by force, making him unpopular among Panamanians. Noriega's government insisted that it had won the presidential election and that irregularities had been on the part of U.S.-backed candidates from opposition parties.

The U.S. began sending thousands of troops to bases in the canal zone. Panamanian authorities alleged that U.S. troops left their bases and illegally stopped and searched vehicles in Panama. During this time, an American Marine got lost in the former French quarter of Panama City, ran a roadblock, and was killed by Panamanian Police (who were then a part of the Panamanian Military).

Guillermo Endara emerged as the candidate representing the opposition against Manuel Noriega's chosen candidate, Carlos Duque. Endara won the election by a significant margin, reportedly nearly 3-to-1. However, the existing government, led by Noriega, annulled the election results on May 10, 1989, claiming \"foreign interference\" as the justification for this action.\n\nDespite the annulment, the legitimacy of the election was recognized by credible international observers, including the Catholic Church and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who certified Endara's victory. This indicates that the election was viewed as valid by independent entities, despite the government's attempts to undermine it.\n\nNoriega's regime had premeditated plans to declare Duque the winner, as evidenced by the preparation of phony tally sheets, demonstrating a clear effort to subvert the democratic process. Following the annulment, widespread public protests erupted against Noriega's authoritarian rule, prompting the U.S. to prepare for military intervention.\n\nOn December 20, 1989, the U.S. invaded Panama, leading to Endara being sworn in as president shortly thereafter. Subsequently, on December 27, 1989, Panama's Electoral Tribunal invalidated the annulment and confirmed Endara's victory, restoring the results of the May election. The U.S. had also provided financial support to Endara's campaign, which adds context to the international dynamics at play during this period.\n\nThis enhanced reasoning process incorporates critical details about the election's legitimacy, the actions of the Noriega regime, and the international response, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the events surrounding the May 1989 elections in Panama.\n\n**Answer:**\nPanama"}], "question_info": {"question": "In which country were democratic elections held in May 1989, and though Guillermo Endara was elected president, the results were annulled by the existing government?", "passages": ["National elections of May 1989 were marred by accusations of fraud from both sides. Panamanian authorities arrested American Kurt Muse who had set up an installation to jam Panamanian radio and broadcast phony election returns. However, the election proceeded and Guillermo Endara won by a margin of over three-to-one over Noriega. The Noriega regime promptly annulled the election, citing massive US interference, and embarked on new repression.\n", "In the Panamanian presidential election of 7 May 1989, Guillermo Endara Galimany, along with vice presidential candidates Ricardo Arias-Calderon and Guillermo \"Billy\" Ford ran against Manuel Noriega's candidate Carlos Duque. The U.S. government gave $10 million to the Endara campaign. The election results were annulled by the Panamanian Government on May 10, due to what Noriega called \"foreign interference.\" However, a tally organized by the anti-Noriega alliance showed Endara beating Noriega's puppet candidate, Carlos Duque, by a nearly 3-to-1 margin. Noriega had planned to declare Duque the winner regardless of the actual results; indeed, his cronies had prepared phony tally sheets to take to the district centers. However, by the time the tally sheets arrived, the opposition's count was already out. Knowing he had been severely defeated, Duque refused to go along with the plan.\n", "In May 1989, during the Panamanian national elections, an alliance of parties opposed to the Noriega dictatorship counted results from the country's election precincts, before they were sent to the district centers. Their tally showed their candidate, Guillermo Endara, defeating Carlos Duque, candidate of a pro-Noriega coalition, by nearly 3\u20131. Endara was physically assaulted by Noriega supporters the next day in his motorcade. Noriega declared the election null and maintained power by force, making him unpopular among Panamanians. Noriega's government insisted that it had won the presidential election and that irregularities had been on the part of U.S.-backed candidates from opposition parties. Bush called on Noriega to honor the will of the Panamanian people. The United States reinforced its Canal Zone garrison, and increased the tempo of training and other activities intended to put pressure on Noriega.\n", "In the morning of December 20, 1989, a few hours after the beginning of the invasion, the presumptive winner of the May 1989 election, Guillermo Endara, was sworn in as president of Panama at a U.S. military installation in the Canal Zone. Subsequently, on December 27, 1989, Panama's Electoral Tribunal invalidated the Noriega regime's annulment of the May 1989 election and confirmed the victory of opposition candidates under the leadership of President Guillermo Endara and Vice Presidents Guillermo Ford and Ricardo Arias Calder\u00f3n.\n", "When Guillermo Endara won the Presidential elections held in May 1989, the Noriega regime annulled the election, citing massive US interference. Foreign election observers, including the Catholic Church and Jimmy Carter certified the electoral victory of Endara despite widespread attempts at fraud by the regime. At the behest of the United States, the Organization of American States convened a meeting of foreign ministers but was unable to obtain Noriega's departure. The U.S. began sending thousands of troops to bases in the canal zone. Panamanian authorities alleged that U.S. troops left their bases and illegally stopped and searched vehicles in Panama. During this time, an American Marine got lost in the former French quarter of Panama City, ran a roadblock, and was killed by Panamanian Police (who were then a part of the Panamanian Military). On December 20, 1989 the United States troops commenced an invasion of Panama. Their primary objectives were achieved quickly, and the combatants withdrawal began on December 27. The US was obligated to hand control of the Panama Canal her to Panama on January 1 due to a treaty signed decades before. Endara was sworn in as President at a U.S. military base on the day of the invasion. General Manuel Noriega is now serving a 40-year sentence for drug trafficking. Estimates as to the loss of life on the Panamanian side vary between 500 and 7000. There are also claims that U.S. troops buried many corpses in mass graves or simply threw them into the sea. For different perspectives, see references below. Much of the Chorillo neighborhood was destroyed by fire shortly after the start of the invasion.\n", "In the morning of December 20, 1989, hours after the invasion started, the presumptive winner of the May 1989 election, Guillermo Endara, was sworn in as president of Panama at a US military installation in the Canal Zone. On December 27, Panama's Electoral Tribunal invalidated the Noriega regime's annulment of the May 1989 election and confirmed the victory of opposition candidates for president (Endara) and vice presidents (Guillermo Ford and Ricardo Arias Calder\u00f3n).\n", "P\u00e9rez Balladares later served as campaign manager for Carlos Duque, Noriega's chosen candidate for the 1989 presidential election. The opposition candidate, Guillermo Endara, was reported by international observers to be leading the vote by a 3-to-1 margin, but the results were annulled by the Noriega government before counting was complete. During the December 1989 US invasion of Panama, however, Endara was certified the election's winner and sworn in as the next president of Panama. During the invasion, P\u00e9rez Balladares was briefly detained and interrogated by US forces for his association with Noriega, but was then released.\n", "The Argentine general election of 1989 was held on 14 May 1989. Voters chose both the President and their legislators and with a turnout of 85.3%, Carlos Menem won the presidency, and the Justicialist Party won the control of both houses of Congress. This is the last presidential election the president was elected by the electoral college.\n", "During the 1980s, the U.S. had supplied aid to Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega, an anti-Communist dictator who engaged in drug trafficking. In May 1989, Noriega annulled the results of a democratic presidential election in which Guillermo Endara had been elected. Bush objected to the annulment of the election and worried about the status of the Panama Canal with Noriega still in office. Despite massive public protests and an attempted coup, Noriega had more staying power than Washington expected and negotiations for him to leave failed. Military planning for an invasion began, but Washington feared it would cause highly negative reactions across Latin America. Bush dispatched 2,000 soldiers to the country, where they began conducting regular military exercises in violation of prior treaties.\n", "Panama's Electoral Tribunal moved quickly to restore civilian constitutional government, reinstated the results of the May 1989 election on December 27, 1989, and confirmed the victory of President Guillermo Endara and Vice Presidents Guillermo Ford and Ricardo Arias Calder\u00f3n.\n"], "__answers__": ["Panamanian", "Panamanian", "Panamanian", "Panama", "Panama", "Panama", "Republic of Panama", "Panam\u00e1", "Republic of Panam\u00e1", "panamanian", "iso 3166 1 pa", "etymology of panama", "Administrative divisions of Panama", "rep\u00fablica de panam\u00e1", "Rep\u00fablica de Panam\u00e1", "panam\u00e0", "Panam\u00e0", "Etymology of Panama", "ISO 3166-1:PA", "Subdivisions of Panama", "Sport in Panama", "panama", "republic of panama", "sport in panama", "Name of Panama", "subdivisions of panama", "administrative divisions of panama", "name of panama", "panam\u00e1", "republic of panam\u00e1"]}}
