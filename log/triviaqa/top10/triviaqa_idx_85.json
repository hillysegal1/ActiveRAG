Based on the retrieved authoritative passages, the following points clarify the accurate description of The Chillingham Bull:\n\n1. **Color Description**: The Chillingham Bull is predominantly **white**. However, it is important to note that it has **red ears**, which distinguishes it from other breeds, such as the White Park cattle that have black ears.\n\n2. **Relation to Other Breeds**: The Chillingham cattle are related to White Park cattle, but there is no gene flow from White Park to Chillingham. This relationship highlights the distinctiveness of the Chillingham breed.\n\n3. **Physical Characteristics**: Chillingham cattle are described as small with upright horns, which contributes to their primitive conformation. This is a notable aspect of their identity as a breed that has been preserved in a wild state.\n\n4. **Historical Context**: The Chillingham Bull has been preserved in Chillingham Park, England, which adds to its significance as a breed that has maintained its characteristics over time.\n\nGiven this information, the previous assertion that The Chillingham Bull has black or dark patches is incorrect.
