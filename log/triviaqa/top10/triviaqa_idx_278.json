This group, often linked to the infamous Hellfire Club, was known for its controversial and hedonistic activities that diverged significantly from the traditional Franciscan values of poverty and humility. \n\nInitially part of the Franciscan order founded by St. Francis of Assisi in the early 13th century, the friars in Wycombe became notorious for their involvement in local politics, disputes over property, and tensions with other religious groups. Their meetings at Medmenham Abbey, where they adopted a more libertine lifestyle and decorated the space with mythological and sexual themes, further solidified their reputation. \n\nThe Brotherhood's activities reflected a broader cultural shift in 18th-century England, challenging conventional morality and contributing to artistic endeavors.

They established numerous friaries across England, including notable locations like Oxford and Canterbury. The Greyfriars, as they were known, played a significant role in the religious landscape of medieval England.\n\n2. **Division of the Order**: The Franciscans split into two main branches in 1517: the Conventuals, who engaged in urban ministry and education, and the Observants, who sought a more ascetic lifestyle. This division reflects the broader tensions within the order regarding adherence to the original ideals of St. Francis.\n\n3. **The Brotherhood of St. Francis of Wycombe**: Established in 1752 at the home of Sir Francis Dashwood, this group was a social club that adopted a playful and ironic association with the Franciscan order. It was not a religious order in the traditional sense but rather a secular organization that engaged in activities that often contradicted the original Franciscan values. The club's meetings at Medmenham Abbey included themes of mythology and sexuality, which diverged sharply from the piety associated with the Franciscans.\n\n4. **Cultural and Social Implications**: The Friars of St Francis of Wycombe are often linked to the Hellfire Club, a name that emerged later and reflects the group's reputation for hedonism and irreverence. This connection illustrates how the original Franciscan ideals were reinterpreted in a more libertine context, leading to their notoriety.\n\n5. **Notoriety and Controversy**: The term \"notorious\" suggests that the activities of the Friars of St Francis of Wycombe were controversial. Their gatherings and the themes they embraced likely led to tensions with more traditional religious groups and local authorities, contributing to a perception of scandal or disrepute.\n\nBy synthesizing this information, we can see that the notorious Friars of St Francis of Wycombe represent a significant cultural shift from the original Franciscan values to a more secular and controversial interpretation. This evolution highlights the complexities of religious identity and the ways in which historical figures and groups can be recontextualized over time.\n\n### Answer:\nThe notorious Friars of St Francis of Wycombe were a social club established in 1752 by Sir Francis Dashwood, which playfully adopted the name of the Franciscan order. Unlike the original Franciscans, who were dedicated to poverty and service, this group engaged in activities that were often irreverent and hedonistic, reflecting a secular interpretation of Franciscan ideals. Their meetings at Medmenham Abbey included themes of mythology and sexuality, leading to their association with the Hellfire Club and contributing to their notoriety.

The Friars had a long and esteemed history in Oxford, listing many famous alumni, including the English statesman, Robert Grosseteste, also a theologian and Bishop of Lincoln, who became head of Greyfriars, Master of the School of Oxford from 1208, and the first Chancellor of the University of Oxford. In 1517, the order divided into two branches. The friars who had been living in city-convents, ministering there and teaching in universities became known as \"Conventuals\"; while the friars who preferred a more eremitical life became known as \"Observants\". (The Capuchins developed in 1528.) The friaries were suppressed during the Reformation in the 16th century.\n", "It is possible that Friar Waire is to be identified with Thomas Wyre, one of the signatories to the surrender of the Franciscan friary of Dorchester, 30 September 1538. However, it is uncertain to what order he belonged. If he was a Franciscan it is remarkable that his death is not recorded in the \"Grey Friars' Chronicle\", and that no mention is made of him in such English Franciscan martyrologists as Bouchier or Angelus a S. Francisco.\n", "The first meeting of the group known facetiously as \"Brotherhood of St. Francis of Wycombe\", \"Order of Knights of West Wycombe\" was held at Sir Francis' family home in West Wycombe on \"Walpurgis Night\" in 1752. \n", "Edward Reginald Francis (31 January 1929 \u2013 16 May 2004) was Archdeacon of Bromley from 1979 to 1994.\n", "The Franciscan Friars were an order of monks founded by St Francis of Assisi in 1209. In 1237 a group of these monks came to Lichfield to set up home. In the town they became known as the Grey Friars because of the colour of their habits. The Bishop of Lichfield at the time, Bishop Stavenby founded the Friary when he granted the friars \u2018certain free burgages in the town for them to set their house on\u2019.\n", "Greyfriars was a Franciscan friary in Canterbury, the first friary of that order in England. The first Franciscans arrived in the country in 1224 (during the lifetime of the order's founder Francis of Assisi) and the friary was set up soon afterwards. It was dissolved in 1538 and the only surviving building of the complex is the Greyfriars Chapel, now worshipped in by Anglican Franciscans since 2003.\n", "Greyfriars is a monastic house in Bedford, England. The house of the Grey Friars (or Franciscan friars) was founded either by Mabilea de Plateshull (Lady Mabel de Pattishall) (according to Leland) or John St. John (according to \"Valor Ecclesiasticus\") during the reign of King Edward II, and their church was dedicated on 3 November 1295. The date of the arrival of the Franciscans in the town is not known. \n", "Sir Francis's club was never originally known as a Hellfire Club; it was given this name much later. His club in fact used a number of other names, such as the \"Brotherhood of St. Francis of Wy\", \"Order of Knights of West Wycombe\", \"The Order of the Friars of St Francis of Wycombe\", and later, after moving their meetings to Medmenham Abbey, they became the \"Monks\" or \"Friars of Medmenham\". The first meeting at Sir Francis's family home in West Wycombe was held on \"Walpurgis Night\", 1752; a much larger meeting, it was something of a failure and no large-scale meetings were held there again. In 1751, Dashwood, leased Medmenham Abbey on the Thames from a friend, Francis Duffield. On moving into the Abbey, Dashwood had numerous expensive works done on the building. It was rebuilt by the architect Nicholas Revett in the style of the 18th-century Gothic revival. At this time, the motto \"Fais ce que tu voudras\" was placed above a doorway in stained glass. It is thought that William Hogarth may have executed murals for this building; none, however, survive. Underneath the Abbey, Dashwood had a series of caves carved out from an existing one. It was decorated again with mythological themes, phallic symbols and other items of a sexual nature.\n", "Greyfriars, Stamford was a Franciscan friary in Lincolnshire, England.
