The title character, Anne, is a young orphan girl known for her imaginative and spirited personality. Her full name is Anne Shirley, which is a crucial aspect of her identity throughout the story. \n\nTo determine her surname, I refer to the passages that explicitly state her full name, confirming that she is consistently referred to as Anne Shirley. This is supported by multiple authoritative sources that clarify her identity as the title character. \n\nAdditionally, it is important to note that while one passage mentions \"Shirley\" as the surname, it lacks context by not stating that \"Anne\" is her first name. This could lead to confusion, so it is essential for the model to recognize that \"Anne Shirley\" is the complete name of the character.\n\nFurthermore, understanding the context of Anne's background enhances the knowledge about her character. She is mistakenly sent to live with Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, who had intended to adopt a boy to help them on their farm. The story is set in the late 19th century in the fictional town of Avonlea on Prince Edward Island, which adds depth to her character and the narrative.\n\nBy integrating this information, the model can accurately represent the character's full name and context, thereby reducing the likelihood of factual errors and addressing potential model illusions.\n\n**Answer:**\nShirley"}], "question_info": {"question": "What is the surname of the title character of Anne of Green Gables?", "passages": ["BULLET::::- Shirley, the surname of the title character in \"Anne of Green Gables\"\n", "BULLET::::- \"Anne of Green Gables\" (Aunt Josephine Barry (Charmion King))\n", "Gilbert Blythe is a fictional character in Lucy Maud Montgomery's \"Anne of Green Gables\" series of novels.\n", "Anne of Green Gables\n", "Anne of Green Gables is a 1908 novel by Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery (published as L.M.
