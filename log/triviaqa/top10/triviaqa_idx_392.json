This description aligns with the characteristics of beetles, which possess hard forewings that serve to protect their hind wings.\n\nFurther supporting this definition, authoritative sources confirm that coleopterology is specifically defined as the scientific study of beetles belonging to the order Coleoptera.

Informally, coleopterists may refer to their work as \"beetling.\"\n\nIt is also important to note that while some sources mention that coleopterology includes the study of \"beetles and weevils,\" it is crucial to clarify that weevils are a subset of beetles.
