These meetings occurred in 1899 and in 1907. Three treaties were signed and put into effect in 1899, including the treatment of prisoners of war and the protection of hospital ships. In 1907 thirteen additional treaties were signed. These cover regulations concerning war on land, the declaration of war, the rights and responsibilities of neutral countries, and rights and restrictions during naval war.\n", "International law has prohibited the use of chemical weapons since 1899, under the Hague Convention: Article 23 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land adopted by the First Hague Conference \"especially\" prohibited employing \"poison and poisoned arms\". A separate declaration stated that in any war between signatory powers, the parties would abstain from using projectiles \"the object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases\".\n", "Participants in the international Hague Peace Conferences used Lieber's text as the basis for negotiations which resulted in the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. These two international agreements set forth laws of land and naval warfare. Subsequently, during World War I and World War II, many of these laws were broken. Following World War II, jurists at the Nuremberg Trials and the Tokyo Trials ruled that by 1939 the rules for armed conflicts, particularly those concerning belligerent and neutral nationals, had been recognized by all civilized nations and thus could apply to officials even of countries that never signed the Hague Conventions. Some features of the Lieber Code are still evident in the Geneva Conventions of 1949.\n", "The Hague Convention of 1899, Declaration III, prohibited the use in \"international warfare\" of bullets that easily expand or flatten in the body.\n", "On 20 October 1868 the first, unsuccessful, attempt to expand the 1864 treaty was undertaken. With the 'Additional Articles relating to the Condition of the Wounded in War' an attempt was initiated to clarify some rules of the 1864 convention and to extend them to maritime warfare. The Articles were signed but was only ratified by the Netherlands and North America. The Netherlands later withdrew their ratification. The protection of the victims of maritime warfare would later be realized by the third Hague Convention of 1899 and the tenth Hague Convention of 1907.\n", "BULLET::::- 1899 \u2013 International Convention for Adapting to Maritime Warfare the Principles of the Geneva Convention of 22 August 1864 [Hague III] (The Hague, 29 July 1899)\n", "BULLET::::- Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, among the first formal statements of the laws of war and war crimes in international law, signed July 1899 and October 1907\n", "BULLET::::- Geneva Conventions, for the humanitarian treatment of war (1864, 1906, 1929, 1949)\n", "BULLET::::- 1910 \u2013 International Convention respecting Bombardments by Naval Forces in Time of War [Hague IX]\n"], "__answers__": ["Hague Conventions", "Hague Convention", "hague convention", "Hague conventions", "The Hague Convention", "Hague convention", "haig convention", "hague convention disambiguation", "hague conventions", "Hague Convention (disambiguation)", "Haig convention"]}}
