The structure of a drupe consists of three main layers: the exocarp (the outer skin), the mesocarp (the fleshy middle), and the endocarp (the hard inner layer surrounding the seed). \n\nDrupes are categorized as indehiscent fruits, meaning they do not split open at maturity to release their seeds. They usually develop from a single carpel and are primarily derived from flowers with superior ovaries. The defining characteristic of a drupe is the hard, lignified stone that is formed from the ovary wall of the flower.\n\nCommon examples of drupes include peaches, plums, cherries, olives, and coconuts, which are often referred to as stone fruits. Additionally, there are variations in the classification of fruits that resemble drupes; for instance, the term \"drupaceous\" describes fruits that have similar structures but may not fully meet the botanical definition of a drupe. Some fruits, such as those from the Coffea species, can be classified as either drupes or berries, indicating a degree of overlap in definitions.\n\nFurthermore, in the context of aggregate fruits, individual drupes (termed drupelets) can cluster together to form larger fruits, such as raspberries. This complexity in fruit classification enhances the understanding of botanical relationships and encourages the model to engage in comparative analysis of different fruit types.\n\nBy integrating this knowledge, the model can improve its ability to categorize fruits, understand their relationships, and make logical inferences about their characteristics and classifications.
