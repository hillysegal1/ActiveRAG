This album is particularly significant as it is the last one to feature lead vocalist **Chester Bennington**, who tragically passed away on **July 20, 2017**, shortly after the album's release.\n\nUnderstanding the timeline is crucial: the album was released before Bennington's death, which adds emotional weight to the music and its reception. Additionally, the song \"One More Light\" was released as a single to US contemporary hit radio on **October 3, 2017**, after Bennington's passing, marking it as a posthumous release. This context helps to illustrate how the events surrounding the album's release and Bennington's death are interconnected.\n\nFurthermore, the \"One More Light World Tour,\" which began in May 2017 to support the album, was impacted by Bennington's death, leading to the cancellation of the North American leg on **July 21, 2017**. This illustrates how one event (the death of a band member) can have cascading effects on subsequent events (the tour's cancellation).\n\nBy analyzing these relationships, I can infer that the release of \"One More Light\" not only marks a significant moment in Linkin Park's discography but also serves as a poignant reminder of the impact of personal loss on artistic expression and public reception.\n\n### Answer:\nLinkin Park released \"One More Light\" on May 19, 2017."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhen did linkin park release one more light\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['One More Light is the seventh studio album by American rock band Linkin Park.
