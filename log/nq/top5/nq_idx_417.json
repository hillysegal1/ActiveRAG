Latin was the primary language for Mass until around 1964.\n\n2. **Vatican II Influence**: The Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) was a pivotal moment for the Roman Catholic Church, leading to significant reforms, including changes in liturgical practices. One of the council's key outcomes was the permission for the use of vernacular languages in the Mass.\n\n3. **Bishops' Conferences' Role**: Following Vatican II, Bishops' Conferences around the world voted to expand the use of vernacular languages in the liturgy. This collective decision-making process illustrates how local church authorities sought to adapt to the needs of their congregations.\n\n4. **Gradual Implementation**: The directives from Vatican II began to take effect in 1964, leading to a gradual implementation of vernacular languages in the Mass. This process involved a series of documents from Rome that authorized the increasing use of local languages.\n\n5. **Revised Missal of 1970**: By 1970, the Roman Missal was revised, allowing for the option of celebrating Mass in the vernacular. This marked a significant shift away from Latin as the sole language of the Mass, indicating a formal acknowledgment of the changes initiated by Vatican II.\n\n6. **Current Practice**: Today, while the majority of Masses are celebrated in the vernacular, Latin is still used in some contexts, either occasionally or regularly. This reflects a coexistence of traditional and modern practices within the Church.\n\n7. **Regulatory Framework**: The current regulations state that Mass can be celebrated in either Latin or another language, provided that the liturgical texts used are approved. This flexibility allows for a variety of practices while maintaining a connection to tradition.\n\n8. **Causal Relationships**: The transition from Latin to vernacular languages can be understood as a causal relationship where the directives from Vatican II (cause) led to a significant change in the language of the Mass (effect). This demonstrates how institutional decisions can influence religious practices.\n\n9. **Temporal Sequencing**: The timeline of events (1964 directives, gradual implementation, 1970 Missal) provides a clear sequence that aids in understanding the progression of change, emphasizing the importance of temporal order in causal relationships.\n\n10. **Complexity and Variation**: The acknowledgment that Latin is still used in some contexts allows for an understanding that changes in practice can coexist with traditional elements. This complexity enhances the model's ability to reason about situations where multiple factors or practices are present.\n\n### Answer:\nThe use of Latin in the Mass largely ceased after the Second Vatican Council, with significant changes implemented by 1970. The council's directives initiated a gradual shift towards the use of vernacular languages, allowing the liturgy to be celebrated in the native languages of congregations, while still permitting the occasional use of Latin in some contexts."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhen did they stop saying mass in latin\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n[\"Mass was said in Latin until around 1964, when Vatican II's directives came into effect. \\n\", 'Historically speaking, \"Latin Mass\" can be applied also to the various forms of Pre-Tridentine Mass from about the year 190 of Pope Victor, when the Church in Rome changed from Greek to Latin.\\n', 'Latin Mass\\n', 'Bishops\\' Conferences from all over the world soon voted to expand the use of the vernacular, and requested confirmation of this choice from Rome.
