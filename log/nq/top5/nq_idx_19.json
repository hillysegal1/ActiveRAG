They mention previous seasons where the Steelers missed the playoffs or had losing records, which may not be relevant to the current inquiry.\n\nBased on this analysis, the model's knowledge should be updated to reflect that the Steelers lost to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional round of the playoffs last year. This information is crucial for accurately answering the question and alleviating any potential model illusions regarding the Steelers' playoff performance.\nPlease verify the above reasoning process for errors, \nthen enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to update the language model's knowledge, prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions.\nAfterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n\nGeneration Format:\nknowledge enhanced inference process:\nAnswer:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Knowledge Enhanced Inference Process:**\n\nTo determine who the Pittsburgh Steelers lost to in the playoffs last year, I will analyze the relevant passages provided.
