The NCAA Tournament began to gain traction in the mid-1940s, particularly after notable events like the 1945 recognition of stronger competition in the NCAA.\n\n3. **Key Developments**: The turning point for the NCAA Tournament's prominence occurred in the 1950s:\n   - The NCAA's decision in 1950 to prohibit teams from participating in both tournaments effectively directed top teams towards the NCAA.\n   - The fallout from the 1951 gambling and point-shaving scandals significantly tarnished the NIT's reputation, while the NCAA Tournament emerged as the primary determinant of the national champion.\n\n4. **Shift in Prestige**: By the late 1950s and into the 1960s, the NCAA Tournament had firmly established itself as the premier event. The expansion of the tournament field (from 25 teams in 1975 to 68 by 2011) and the success of teams like UCLA contributed to its growing popularity and visibility.\n\n5. **Cultural Impact**: The NCAA Tournament became a cultural phenomenon by the late 1980s and 1990s, characterized by extensive media coverage, fan engagement, and significant financial backing. The NIT, while still respected, was increasingly viewed as a consolation prize for teams that did not qualify for the NCAA Tournament.\n\n6. **Final Decline of the NIT**: The NCAA's strategic initiatives, including the introduction of the National Commissioners Invitational Tournament in 1974, aimed to further diminish the NIT's relevance.

During the 1940s, the relative status of the two tournaments was unclear, and thus some years produced disputed national championship claims. Some contemporary sources claim superiority for the NIT during this time. In 1943, in a shrewd competitive move the NCAA tournament began sharing Madison Square Garden with the NIT. In 1945, following victories by the NCAA champions over the NIT champions in the Red Cross games, \"The New York Times\" indicated that many teams who could potentially get bids to enter either tournament would probably choose the NCAA tournament \"because it involves stronger competition.\" In 1950, City College of New York won both the NIT and the NCAA tournaments in the same season, coincidentally defeating Bradley University in the championship game of both tournaments, and thus united the titles.\n", "In 1939, another national tournament was implemented by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The location of the NCAA Tournament varied from year to year, and it soon used multiple locations each year, so more fans could see games without traveling to New York. Although the NIT was created earlier and was more prestigious than the NCAA for many years, it ultimately lost popularity and status to the NCAA Tournament. In 1950, following a double win by the 1949\u201350 CCNY Beavers men's basketball team (when the NIT comprised 12 and the NCAA 8 teams), the NCAA ruled that no team could compete in both tournaments, and effectively indicated that a team eligible for the NCAA tournament should play in it. Not long afterward, assisted by the 1951 scandals based in New York City, the NCAA tournament had become more prestigious than before, with conference champions and the majority of top-ranked teams competing there. The NCAA tournament eventually overtook the NIT by 1960. Through the 1960s and 1970s, with UCLA leading the way as winner of ten NCAA Tournament championships, a shift in power to teams from the west amplified the shift of attention away from the New York City-based NIT. When the NCAA tournament expanded its field of teams from 25 to 32 in 1975, to 48 in 1980, to 64 in 1985, and to 68 teams in 2011, interest in the NCAA tournament increased again and again, as it comprised more and more teams, soon including all of the strongest ones. (Expansion also improved the distribution of playing locations, which number roughly one-third the number of teams in the field.)\n", "BULLET::::- During 1939, Long Island University finished the regular season unbeaten but decided to accept instead an invitation to the second NIT (which they won) instead of the first and only NABC tournament (later called the NCAA tournament), as the NIT was more prestigious at the time. It wasn't until the mid-1950s that the NCAA required that its tournament would have \"first choice\" in determining teams for their field. Before then, many of the more successful teams during the regular season chose to play in the NIT instead of the NCAA tournament.\n", "After the fall-out from the 1951 gambling and point-shaving scandals, the NCAA tournament pulled out of Madison Square Garden. With conference champions and the majority of the top-ranked teams participating in it, the NCAA tournament since then came to be regarded as the more important post-season tourney and the sole determiner of the national championship, although following the taint of the gambling scandals, the NIT was still considered a quality tournament for some time afterward. The NCAA built on the momentum of three consecutive Red Cross \"mythical national championship\" game victories over the NIT, eventually outmaneuvering the NIT by adeptly avoiding permanent damage from the 1951 gambling and point-shaving scandals and by adding more teams. As the NCAA Tournament steadily gained preeminence and became the sole source of naming the national champion, winners of the NCAA Tournament during those early years were given the same level of honor.\n", "The National Commissioners Invitational Tournament was an eight-team postseason college men's basketball tournament run by the NCAA. It was introduced in 1974 as the Collegiate Commissioners Association Tournament. It was created because the NCAA wanted to \"kill\" the NIT, which, at that time, it did not control. It only lasted two years before being discontinued after changes to the NCAA Tournament which allowed more than one team per conference to participate.\n"], "__answers__": ["By the mid-1980s"]}}
