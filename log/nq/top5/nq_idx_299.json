While it is commonly referred to as the \"Radcliffe Line,\" named after Sir Cyril Radcliffe, who drew the boundary, it is also known locally as the \"International Border (IB).\" This designation reflects how the border is recognized in regional contexts.\n\nGeographically, the India-Pakistan border extends from the Line of Control (LoC) in the north, which separates Indian-controlled Kashmir from Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, down to the Zero Point between the Indian state of Gujarat and the Sindh province of Pakistan in the south. This geographical delineation is crucial for understanding the border's extent and significance.\n\nThe border is heavily patrolled by India's Border Security Force (BSF), and the Indian Army conducts exercises in the area to acclimatize troops to the challenging terrain, particularly in the northern boundary of the Greater Rann of Kutch. This military presence underscores the border's strategic importance.\n\nAdditionally, specific segments of the border, such as the \"Hindumalkot Border,\" are noteworthy points that could be relevant for discussions about the border's various segments and their significance.\n\nBy integrating this comprehensive understanding of the India-Pakistan border, including its historical context, geographical layout, military significance, and specific names, the model can provide a more accurate and nuanced response.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe border between India and Pakistan is commonly referred to as the \"International Border (IB)\" in local terms, but it is also known as the \"Radcliffe Line,\" named after Sir Cyril Radcliffe, who drew the boundary during the partition of British India in 1947."}], "question_info": {"question": "what is the name of india pakistan border", "passages": ["BULLET::::- The Hindumalkot Border, the Indo-Pak Border, derives its name from Hindumal, the Diwan of Bikaner.
