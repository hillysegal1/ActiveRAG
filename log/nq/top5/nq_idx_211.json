In low rainfall areas, unleached calcium pushes pH to 8.5 and with the addition of exchangeable sodium, soils may reach pH\\xa010. Beyond a pH of 9, plant growth is reduced. High pH results in low micro-nutrient mobility, but water-soluble chelates of those nutrients can correct the deficit.

This phenomenon is primarily caused by human activities, particularly the release of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. These compounds can react with water vapor and other chemicals to form sulfuric and nitric acids, which then fall to the ground as precipitation.\n\n2. **Sources of Acidity**: The retrieved passages highlight that acidic precipitation can arise from both anthropogenic sources, such as industrial emissions, and natural sources, such as volcanic eruptions. The last passage specifically mentions that in industrialized areas, rain is typically acidic due to these dissolved oxides. This duality of sources is important for understanding the broader context of acid rain.\n\n3. **Wet Deposition Process**: The concept of wet deposition is crucial in understanding how acids are transferred from the atmosphere to the Earth's surface. This process involves precipitation removing acids from the atmosphere, which can occur with any form of precipitation, including rain and snow. This reinforces the idea that the term \"acid rain\" encompasses all acidic forms of precipitation.\n\n4. **Environmental Impact**: Acid rain has significant environmental impacts, including harm to aquatic ecosystems, damage to vegetation, and deterioration of buildings and monuments.
