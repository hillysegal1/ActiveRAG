The term \"ice age\" refers to a period in Earth's history when significant portions of the planet were covered by ice sheets and glaciers. \n2. The most well-known ice ages are part of a series of glacial and interglacial periods that have occurred throughout Earth's history.\n3. The first major ice age, known as the Huronian glaciation, occurred around 2.4 billion years ago during the Proterozoic Eon.\n4. However, when people refer to \"the first ice age,\" they often mean the more recent Pleistocene ice age, which began about 2.6 million years ago and lasted until about 11,700 years ago.\n5. The Pleistocene ice age is characterized by repeated glacial cycles, where glaciers expanded and retreated multiple times.\n\nAnswer:\nThe first major ice age, known as the Huronian glaciation, occurred around 2.4 billion years ago, while the more recent and well-known Pleistocene ice age began about 2.6 million years ago.\nTo update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions. \nI retrieved some knowledge that may update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions\nNote that these passages are retrieved from the most authoritative knowledge repositories, so they are assumed to be correct.\nknowledge:\nBased on the retrieved passages, the following information can be extracted that may update the model's knowledge regarding the \"Ice Age\" franchise:\n\n1. **Ice Age (2002 film)**: The first film in the \"Ice Age\" franchise was released in 2002.

The term \"ice age\" can refer to both geological periods characterized by extensive glaciation and popular media representations of the concept.\n2. In geological terms, the first major ice age, known as the Huronian glaciation, occurred around 2.4 billion years ago during the Proterozoic Eon.\n3. The more recent and well-known Pleistocene ice age began about 2.6 million years ago and lasted until approximately 11,700 years ago, characterized by repeated glacial cycles.\n4. However, the question may also pertain to the \"Ice Age\" franchise, which includes animated films and video games.\n5. The first film in the \"Ice Age\" franchise, released by Blue Sky Studios, premiered in 2002. This film is often what people refer to when they mention \"Ice Age\" in a contemporary context.\n6. Additionally, there is a video game titled \"Ice Age,\" released in 2002 for the Game Boy Advance, which further associates the name with media rather than geological periods.\n7. There are other unrelated uses of the term \"Ice Age,\" such as the 1975 German film and the 1984 title \"The Ice Age Cometh,\" which may cause confusion but are not part of the widely recognized franchise.\n\nTo clarify, when discussing \"the first Ice Age,\" it is essential to distinguish between the geological periods and the media franchise. The model should be updated to reflect that the first film in the popular \"Ice Age\" franchise was released in 2002, while the geological ice ages refer to much earlier events in Earth's history.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe term \"Ice Age\" can refer to both geological periods and media representations. The first major geological ice age, known as the Huronian glaciation, occurred around 2.4 billion years ago, while the more recent Pleistocene ice age began about 2.6 million years ago.
