It indicates that the original slaughterhouse workers were largely recent immigrants of Irish, German, and Scandinavian backgrounds. This demographic detail highlights the diverse origins of the workforce in slaughterhouses.\n\nMoreover, it is important to note that most of these workers lived in slums adjacent to the slaughterhouses, which underscores the challenging socioeconomic conditions they faced.
