This context is crucial for understanding the League's objectives and motivations.\n\n2. **First Significant Session**: The first significant session of the Muslim League, known as the Lahore Resolution, took place in Lahore, Punjab, from March 22 to 24, 1940. This session was pivotal as it marked a formal demand for a separate nation for Muslims, which later led to the creation of Pakistan. The choice of Lahore for this session was significant due to its historical and cultural importance to the Muslim community.\n\n3. **Historical Context and Causation**: The political climate in India, particularly the actions of the Indian National Congress and the socio-political dynamics between Hindus and Muslims, influenced the formation and activities of the Muslim League. Understanding this context helps clarify why the League sought to establish a separate political identity.\n\n4. **Key Proposals and Theoretical Frameworks**: During the 1940 session, Muhammad Ali Jinnah articulated the Two Nation Theory, which posited that Muslims and Hindus constituted two distinct nations. This theory was foundational in justifying the demand for a separate state, illustrating how ideological frameworks can emerge from historical contexts.\n\n5. **Impact of Leadership**: The role of Muhammad Ali Jinnah as a leader was instrumental in shaping the direction of the Muslim League. His proposals and leadership style significantly influenced the political landscape, demonstrating how individual leadership can impact collective movements.\n\n6. **Resolution and Outcomes**: The Lahore Resolution is often seen as a turning point that led to significant political changes in the Indian subcontinent. Understanding the implications of such resolutions helps the model recognize how formal declarations can lead to the establishment of new political entities and national identities.\n\n### Answer:\nThe first session of the Muslim League was held in Dhaka in 1906, during the All India Muhammadan Educational Conference.
