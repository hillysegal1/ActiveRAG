Millard had initially declined a request from Grant's record label to allow her to record the song; some segments of the Christian community had reacted negatively to her divorce, and Millard wasn't sure if he wanted to be involved. After consulting with his pastor, who felt Millard should accept the opportunity, Millard began to reconsider, and finally agreed to let her cover it after talking with Grant over the phone. Grant had planned to release her version of the song as the first single from her upcoming album and MercyMe would release a different song as their first single, hoping to capitalize on having written what would presumably become a major hit for Grant. The band released their first single from the album, \"Bless Me Indeed (Jabez's Song)\", which performed poorly at Christian radio, leading to poor sales of \"Almost There\". Plans were made to release a second single from the record, but the band's manager, Scott Brickell, decided to reach out to Grant to see if she still planned to release her version as a single. Grant gave MercyMe her blessing to release the song as their second single and signed the rights back to the band; \"I Can Only Imagine\" was released on October 12, 2001 as the album's second single.\n", "BULLET::::- Julie Graham as Abby Grant.
