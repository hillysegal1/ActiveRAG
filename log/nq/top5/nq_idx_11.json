This treaty not only recognized the independence of the United States but also involved negotiations concerning territorial claims that affected Spain.\n\n1. **Treaty of Paris (1783)**:\n   - The Treaty of Paris was a significant diplomatic agreement that concluded the American Revolutionary War. One of its key outcomes was the return of Florida to Spain. Florida had been ceded to Britain in 1763 but was returned to Spain as part of the negotiations. This return was strategic for Spain, as it aimed to re-establish its influence in North America and counter British expansion.\n\n2. **Historical Context of Spain's Territorial Claims**:\n   - Understanding the geopolitical landscape of the time is crucial. Spain was concerned about maintaining its territories in the Americas, especially in light of the growing power of the United States. The return of Florida was part of Spain's broader strategy to secure its remaining territories and influence in the region.\n\n3. **Internal Political Dynamics**:\n   - The passages provided earlier mention significant political changes in Spain, including the transition from monarchy to republic and the existence of exiled governments. While these events occurred later, they reflect the ongoing internal struggles within Spain that were influenced by external conflicts, such as the Revolutionary War. The return of Florida can be seen as a moment that would later impact these internal dynamics.\n\n4. **Broader Themes of Colonialism and Nationalism**:\n   - The reference to the Spanish Reconquest in Chile and the internal divisions within Spain highlight the themes of colonialism and nationalism. These themes are relevant as they provide insight into Spain's motivations for reclaiming territories like Florida and maintaining its colonial presence in the Americas.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the enhanced reasoning process, it is clear that the state returned to Spain after the Revolutionary War was Florida.
