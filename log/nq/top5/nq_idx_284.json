The key experiment that led to this model was conducted by Ernest Rutherford in 1909, known as the gold foil experiment. In this experiment, Rutherford and his team fired alpha particles at a thin sheet of gold foil and observed how they scattered. Most of the particles passed through, but some were deflected at large angles, suggesting that the atom is mostly empty space with a small, dense, positively charged nucleus at its center. This was a significant departure from the earlier plum pudding model proposed by J.J. Thomson, which suggested that atoms were a diffuse cloud of positive charge with electrons embedded within it.

Thomson. The key experiment that led to the formulation of the nuclear model was conducted by Ernest Rutherford in 1909, known as the gold foil experiment. In this experiment, Rutherford and his team fired alpha particles at a thin sheet of gold foil and observed their scattering patterns. Most of the particles passed through the foil, but a small fraction were deflected at large angles, indicating that the atom consists of a small, dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons. This finding was pivotal in establishing the nuclear model of the atom.\n\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that prior to Rutherford's work, Hantaro Nagaoka had already proposed an early nuclear model in 1904, where electrons orbit a dense nucleus, resembling a miniature solar system. This suggests that the concept of a nuclear model was not entirely new with Rutherford, but rather a development of existing ideas.\n\nFurthermore, the nuclear shell model, proposed by Dmitry Ivanenko in 1932 and later refined by several physicists, illustrates that the understanding of atomic structure continued to evolve after Rutherford's initial model. This model describes the arrangement of protons and neutrons within the nucleus in terms of energy levels, adding complexity to the nuclear model.\n\nIn summary, the development of the nuclear model of the atom involved contributions from multiple scientists:\n1. Hantaro Nagaoka proposed an early nuclear model in 1904.\n2. Ernest Rutherford's gold foil experiment in 1909 led to the widely recognized nuclear model established in 1911.\n3. The nuclear shell model introduced in the 1930s further advanced the understanding of atomic structure.\n\nBy incorporating this information, we can provide a more comprehensive and accurate account of the historical context and contributions to the nuclear model of the atom, thereby alleviating potential model illusions.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe nuclear model of the atom was primarily established by Ernest Rutherford in 1911 following his gold foil experiment in 1909. However, it is important to note that Hantaro Nagaoka proposed an early nuclear model in 1904, where electrons orbit a dense nucleus.
