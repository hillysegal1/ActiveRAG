This marked a significant loss of legislative independence for Ireland.\n\n2. **Early Legislative Independence**:\n   - In the late 18th century, particularly during the 1780s, Ireland experienced a limited form of legislative independence due to the efforts of figures like Henry Grattan. However, this was short-lived, as the subsequent political climate and the threat of foreign intervention led to the Act of Union.\n\n3. **Anglo-Irish Treaty**:\n   - The Anglo-Irish Treaty, signed on December 6, 1921, was a crucial turning point. It established the Irish Free State, which came into effect on December 6, 1922. This treaty recognized Ireland's autonomy but maintained the British monarch as the head of state, indicating that while Ireland was independent, it was still part of the British Empire.\n\n4. **Transition to Full Sovereignty**:\n   - The Irish Free State was a dominion, which meant it had limited powers compared to a fully sovereign state. The adoption of a new constitution in 1937 marked a significant step toward full independence, as it established Ireland as a sovereign state. The Statute of Westminster in 1931 further solidified this independence by granting dominions full legislative authority.\n\n5. **De Facto Independence**:\n   - The concept of \"de facto\" independence is important here. While formal independence was declared in 1922, many aspects of self-governance were already being exercised in the years leading up to that date, particularly following the Anglo-Irish War.\n\n6. **Final Steps to Independence**:\n   - Full independence was ultimately achieved in 1949 with the Republic of Ireland Act, which declared Ireland a republic and removed the British monarch as head of state. This marked the culmination of Ireland's long struggle for complete autonomy.\n\n### Answer:\nIreland gained its independence from England on December 6, 1922, with the establishment of the Irish Free State, following the Anglo-Irish Treaty. However, it is important to note that full sovereignty was not achieved until 1949, when the Republic of Ireland Act declared Ireland a republic and removed the British monarch as head of state.

The brief legislative independence achieved in the 1780s was undermined by the Act of Union in 1801, which was motivated by British fears of Ireland aligning with France during the revolutionary wars. This act effectively dissolved the Irish Parliament and integrated Ireland into the United Kingdom.\n\n2. **Key Events Leading to Independence**:\n   - The Anglo-Irish Treaty, signed on December 6, 1921, was a pivotal moment in Ireland's path to independence. It was a result of the Irish War of Independence (1919-1921), which was fueled by a desire for self-governance and national identity. The treaty established the Irish Free State, which came into effect on December 6, 1922, granting Ireland a degree of autonomy while still recognizing the British monarch as the head of state.\n\n3. **Progression Towards Full Sovereignty**:\n   - Although the establishment of the Irish Free State marked a significant step towards independence, it was not until the Republic of Ireland Act in 1949 that Ireland achieved full sovereignty, removing the British monarch as head of state and declaring itself a republic. This illustrates the gradual nature of Ireland's journey to complete independence.\n\n4. **Complex Interactions and Legal Frameworks**:\n   - The relationship between Ireland and Britain was characterized by ongoing tensions, exemplified by events such as the Anglo-Irish Trade War. The legal frameworks established by treaties and acts, including the Statute of Westminster in 1931, played a crucial role in shaping Ireland's legislative independence and political landscape.\n\n5. **Causality and Temporal Relationships**:\n   - The timeline of events from the 1780s through the establishment of the Irish Free State and the eventual declaration of the Republic of Ireland demonstrates the interconnectedness of historical events. Each event influenced subsequent developments, highlighting the complexity of Ireland's quest for independence.\n\n6. **Conflict and Resolution**:\n   - The Anglo-Irish War and the subsequent treaty negotiations illustrate how conflict can lead to significant political changes. Understanding these dynamics enhances the model's ability to analyze how historical conflicts can shape national identities and governance structures.\n\n### Answer:\nIreland gained its independence from England on December 6, 1922, with the establishment of the Irish Free State, which was a significant step towards autonomy.
