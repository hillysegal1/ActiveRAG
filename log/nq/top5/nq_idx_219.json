This move was part of a broader trend in the music industry during the late 1980s and early 1990s, where many companies sought to establish production facilities in Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs. Fender officially opened its factory in Ensenada, Mexico, in 1987, which marked the beginning of their production of amplifiers in that location. \n\nAnswer:\nFender started making amps in Mexico in 1987.\nTo update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions. \nI retrieved some knowledge that may update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions\nNote that these passages are retrieved from the most authoritative knowledge repositories, so they are assumed to be correct.\nknowledge:\nBased on the provided passages, the following information can be extracted that may update the model's knowledge regarding when Fender started making amplifiers in Mexico:\n\n1. **Manufacturing Move to Mexico**: The second passage states that \"most Fender amplifier manufacturing moved to the Ensenada factory in Mexico\" in 1996.

However, the retrieved passages indicate that while Fender did establish a factory in Ensenada, Mexico, in 1996, this marked the significant move of most amplifier manufacturing to that location. The passages do not provide evidence that Fender began producing amplifiers in Mexico as early as 1987; rather, they suggest that the major shift occurred in 1996.\n\nTo enhance the reasoning process, it is essential to clarify that the 1996 date is when most of the amplifier manufacturing moved to Mexico, which is a critical distinction. The earlier mention of 1987 may refer to the establishment of the factory but does not specifically indicate the start of amplifier production.\n\nAdditionally, the context provided in the passages about the broader trend of manufacturing moving to Mexico during the late 1980s and early 1990s supports the idea that Fender's decision was part of a larger industry movement, but it does not pinpoint the exact start date for amplifier production.\n\nThus, the enhanced inference process should focus on the specific information from the passages regarding the 1996 date for the significant move of amplifier production to Mexico.\n\n**Answer:**\nFender started making amps in Mexico in 1996, when most of their amplifier manufacturing moved to the Ensenada factory."}], "question_info": {"question": "when did fender start making amps in mexico", "passages": ["\"Mexican Fender\" is a song by the American rock band Weezer.
