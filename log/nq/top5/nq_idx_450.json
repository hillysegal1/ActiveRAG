A Zippo lighter is a type of refillable lighter that uses a specific type of fuel to operate.\n2. The fuel used in Zippo lighters is typically a liquid that can easily ignite and sustain a flame.\n3. The most common fuel for Zippo lighters is Zippo lighter fluid, which is a refined petroleum product designed specifically for use in these lighters.\n4. Other types of lighter fluids, such as naphtha, can also be used, but they may not be as effective or safe as the recommended Zippo lighter fluid.\n5. It is important to avoid using gasoline or other flammable liquids that are not designed for lighters, as they can be dangerous and may damage the lighter.\n\nAnswer:\nZippo lighter fluid (a refined petroleum product) is the type of fuel that goes in a Zippo lighter.\nTo update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions. \nI retrieved some knowledge that may update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions\nNote that these passages are retrieved from the most authoritative knowledge repositories, so they are assumed to be correct.\nknowledge:\nBased on the retrieved passages, the following information can be extracted that may update the model's knowledge regarding the type of fuel used in a Zippo lighter:\n\n1. **Fuel Type**: The passages indicate that Zippo lighters do not come pre-filled with fuel when purchased new.

However, if the flame is blown from the top down, it will be easily extinguished. The proper way to extinguish the lighter is to close the top half, which starves the flame of oxygen, but unlike other lighters, this does not cut off the fuel supply. One of the recognizable features of Zippo is the fact that it burns with a wick. Opening the top lid produces an easily recognizable \"clink\" sound for which Zippo lighters are known, and a different but similarly recognizable \"clunk\" when the lighter is closed. This noise is produced by the spring-loaded toggling cam, a little lever that keeps the lid closed or opened securely. \n"], "__answers__": ["butane", "lighter fluid"]}}
