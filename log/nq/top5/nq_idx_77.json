This is a key step in many metabolic processes, as it releases energy.\n\n3. **Products of Hydrolysis**: The removal of one phosphate group from ATP results in the formation of ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and an inorganic phosphate (Pi). This can be summarized as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{ADP} + \\text{Pi}\n   \\]\n   However, it is also important to note that in some contexts, the hydrolysis of ATP can lead to the formation of AMP (adenosine monophosphate) and pyrophosphate (PP) if two phosphate groups are removed.\n\n4. **Energetics of the Reaction**: The hydrolysis of ATP is highly exergonic, meaning it releases a significant amount of energy. This energy release is what makes ATP a vital energy currency in biological systems, driving various biochemical reactions.\n\n5. **Further Hydrolysis of Pyrophosphate**: If pyrophosphate (PP) is formed, it can be further hydrolyzed into two inorganic phosphate molecules (2 Pi). This step is also energetically favorable and contributes to the overall energy dynamics of the reaction.\n\n6. **Biochemical Implications**: Understanding the products of ATP hydrolysis (ADP and Pi) and the potential for further hydrolysis of PP allows for a deeper comprehension of metabolic pathways. For example, ADP can be phosphorylated back to ATP, illustrating the cyclical nature of energy transfer in cells.\n\n### Answer:\nWhen one phosphate group is removed from ATP, the breakdown products formed are ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). Additionally, if two phosphate groups are removed, AMP (adenosine monophosphate) and pyrophosphate (PP) can be formed, with PP further hydrolyzing into two inorganic phosphate molecules.
