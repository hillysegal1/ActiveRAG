However, it does not directly pertain to the first award, which is crucial for the current inquiry.\n\n3. **Controversy in Awards**: The mention of controversy surrounding the awarding of the Nobel Prize to Antony Hewish over his PhD student, Jocelyn Bell Burnell, highlights the complexities and discussions that can arise in the Nobel Prize selection process. While this context is interesting, it does not impact the specific question regarding the first Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nIn summary, the key update needed for the model's knowledge is the identification of Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen as the first recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901. This information is critical for accurately answering the question posed and preventing any potential factual errors.\n\n**Answer:**\nWilhelm R\u00f6ntgen"}], "question_info": {"question": "who got the first nobel prize in physics", "passages": ["Nobel Prize in Physics\n", "was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physics (in 1901) for his discoveries.\n", "BULLET::::- Nobel Prize in Physics: John C.
