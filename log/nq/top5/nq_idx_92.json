This historical context is crucial for understanding how states were admitted to the Union.\n\n2. **Historical Context**:\n   - The United States has a total of 50 states, and the admission of states occurred over a long period, starting with the original 13 colonies. The last few states to join were primarily in the 19th and 20th centuries, with Alaska and Hawaii being the final two. Alaska became the 49th state on January 3, 1959, followed by Hawaii later that year.\n\n3. **Passage Analysis**:\n   - The passages provided contain various historical references to statehood but do not directly address the last state. \n     - **Passage 2** mentions Louisiana's admission in 1812, which is significant but not relevant to the last state.\n     - **Passage 3** refers to \"The Delta,\" which is ambiguous and does not pertain to U.S. statehood.\n     - **Passage 4** hints at states admitted around 1889, which could include North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Washington, but again, this is not relevant to the last state.\n     - **Passage 5** discusses California's admission in 1850, providing historical context but not addressing the last state.\n\n4. **Clarifying Unfamiliar Concepts**:\n   - The mention of \"The Delta\" in Passage 3 could lead to confusion, as it does not correspond to a recognized U.S. state.

Hawaii is recognized as the last state to be admitted, and it became the 50th state on August 21, 1959. \n\nAnswer: August 21, 1959.\nTo update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions. \nI retrieved some knowledge that may update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions\nNote that these passages are retrieved from the most authoritative knowledge repositories, so they are assumed to be correct.\nknowledge:\nTo address the question of when the last state became a state, we need to analyze the provided passages for relevant information and identify any contradictions or updates to the model's existing knowledge.\n\n### Extracted Information from Passages:\n1. **Louisiana became a state in 1812.**\n2. **The Delta became a state on 3 August 1991.**\n3. **California became the 31st state of the United States in September 1850.**\n4. **Another state did not become a state until one year later in 1889.**\n\n### Analysis:\n- The passage mentioning \"The Delta became a state on 3 August 1991\" is particularly noteworthy. If \"The Delta\" refers to a recognized state, this could imply that there was a statehood event in 1991 that is not commonly recognized in the context of U.S. states, as the last state to join the United States was Hawaii in 1959.\n- The passage about Louisiana and California provides historical context but does not directly address the question of the last state.\n- The mention of a state not becoming a state until 1889 is vague and does not specify which state is being referred to.\n\n### Contradictory or Updating Information:\n- The claim that \"The Delta became a state on 3 August 1991\" could be misleading if \"The Delta\" is not an officially recognized state in the context of the United States. This needs clarification, as it may represent a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of statehood.\n- The model's knowledge should be updated to reflect that Hawaii is the last state to join the United States, which occurred on August 21, 1959. This is crucial to prevent factual errors regarding statehood.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTo alleviate model illusions and ensure accurate knowledge, it is essential to clarify the status of \"The Delta\" and reinforce that Hawaii is the last state to have become a state in the United States. The model should be updated to reflect this accurate information to prevent the propagation of misleading claims.\nPlease verify the above reasoning process for errors, \nthen enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to update the language model's knowledge, prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions.\nAfterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n\nGeneration Format:\nknowledge enhanced inference process:\nAnswer:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Knowledge Enhanced Inference Process:\n\nTo determine when the last state became a state in the United States, we need to identify which state was the last to join the Union. Based on established historical knowledge, Hawaii is recognized as the last state to be admitted, becoming the 50th state on August 21, 1959.\n\nHowever, the retrieved passages contain some potentially misleading information that requires clarification:\n\n1. **Louisiana became a state in 1812.** - This is accurate historical information but does not pertain to the last state.\n2. **The Delta became a state on 3 August 1991.** - This statement is ambiguous. \"The Delta\" does not refer to any recognized U.S. state. This could be a misinterpretation or error, as there has not been a new state admitted to the Union since Hawaii in 1959.\n3. **California became the 31st state of the United States in September 1850.** - This is accurate but also irrelevant to the question of the last state.\n4. **Another state did not become a state until one year later in 1889.** - This statement lacks specificity and does not clarify which state is being referenced.\n\n### Analysis of Contradictory Information:\n- The claim regarding \"The Delta\" needs to be addressed, as it may lead to confusion about statehood. There has been no state admitted to the United States since Hawaii, and any reference to a new state in 1991 is incorrect.\n- The model's knowledge should be reinforced with the fact that Hawaii is the last state to join the United States, and this fact should be emphasized to prevent the propagation of misleading claims.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTo enhance the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, it is crucial to clarify that Hawaii is the last state to have become a state in the United States on August 21, 1959. The mention of \"The Delta\" should be disregarded as it does not pertain to any recognized statehood event.\n\n### Answer:\nAugust 21, 1959."}], "question_info": {"question": "when did the last state became a state", "passages": ["became a state.\n", "Louisiana became a state in 1812.\n", "The Delta became state on 3 August 1991.\n", "become a state until one year later in 1889.\n", "In September 1850, California became the 31st state of the United States.\n"], "__answers__": ["Hawaii", "August 21 , 1959"]}}
