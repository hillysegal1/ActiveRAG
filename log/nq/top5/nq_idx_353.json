The most prominent figure in this context is Felix Baumgartner, who made a historic jump from approximately 128,000 feet (about 39 kilometers) during the Red Bull Stratos project in October 2012. This event is significant not only for its altitude but also because Baumgartner became the first person to break the sound barrier without the use of a vehicle during freefall, setting multiple records in the process.\n\nWhile the retrieved passages do not provide relevant information about actual space jumps, they do highlight the importance of distinguishing between fictional narratives and factual historical events. For instance, the passages mention various unrelated incidents and fictional characters, which could lead to confusion if not properly contextualized. \n\nTo enhance the model's knowledge, it is crucial to clarify that \"jumping from space\" typically refers to high-altitude jumps, such as those performed by Felix Baumgartner and Alan Eustace. Eustace also made a notable jump from the stratosphere in 2014, reaching an altitude of about 135,890 feet (approximately 41,422 meters), which further solidifies the association of these individuals with the concept of jumping from space.\n\nIn summary, the model should be updated to include the following key points:\n1. Felix Baumgartner is a well-known figure for his jump from the edge of space during the Red Bull Stratos project in 2012.\n2. Alan Eustace also performed a significant high-altitude jump in 2014.\n3. The distinction between fictional accounts and real-life events is essential for accurate knowledge representation.\n\n**Answer:**\nFelix Baumgartner is the guy who famously jumped from space, performing a record-setting jump from approximately 128,000 feet during the Red Bull Stratos project in 2012. Alan Eustace also made a notable jump from the stratosphere in 2014, reaching an altitude of about 135,890 feet."}], "question_info": {"question": "who is the guy that jumped from space", "passages": ["Brewster Rockit: Space Guy!\n", "On January 29, 2019 a man was on the Space Mountain rollercoaster in Disneyland when he climbed out of the ride and jumped down while it was moving in its ascent up the lift hill.
