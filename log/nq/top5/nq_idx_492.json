This layer manages the framing of data packets and the physical addressing necessary for local communication.\n\n4. **Clarifying the Physical Layer's Role**: The Physical layer (Layer 1) is responsible for the transmission of raw bitstreams over a physical medium. It translates logical communication requests from the Data Link layer into hardware-specific operations, facilitating the actual transmission of signals.\n\n5. **Interrelationship Between Layers**: The relationship between the Physical layer and the Data Link layer is crucial. The Data Link layer relies on the Physical layer to transmit the data frames that include MAC addresses.
