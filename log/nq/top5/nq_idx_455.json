The idea for the band originated from discussions between Harrison and Lynne during the sessions for Harrison's 1987 album \"Cloud Nine.\" This context illustrates how collaborative discussions can lead to the formation of new creative entities.\n\n2. **Initial Collaboration**: The group initially came together to record \"Handle with Care,\" a bonus track for Harrison's European single. This collaboration was so successful that it prompted the decision to record a full album.
