This period is characterized by significant physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development. \n\n1. **Age Range and Development**: The toddler stage typically encompasses ages 1 to 3 years. During this time, children achieve critical developmental milestones, such as walking, talking, and beginning to engage in social play. By the end of this stage, around age 3, children often exhibit increased independence and the ability to engage in more complex interactions.\n\n2. **Transition to Preschool**: The transition from toddlerhood to preschool age generally occurs around 3 years old. At this age, children are expected to have developed enough skills to participate in preschool activities, which often include structured learning and socialization with peers. This transition marks a shift in developmental expectations, as preschoolers are typically more capable of following instructions and engaging in group activities.\n\n3. **Cultural and Contextual Variations**: It is important to note that the understanding of developmental stages can vary across cultures and contexts. For instance, in some educational or gaming contexts, the classification of a child may differ based on specific developmental milestones or societal norms. However, the general consensus in developmental psychology is that a child is no longer a toddler by the age of 3.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the above points, we can conclude that while the toddler stage officially ends at 36 months, the transition to being classified as a preschooler typically occurs around 3 years old.

Based on the authoritative knowledge retrieved, a toddler is defined as a child aged **12 to 36 months**. This means that the toddler stage begins at 1 year (12 months) and ends at 3 years (36 months).\n\nDuring this period, children undergo significant physical, emotional, and cognitive development. By the time a child reaches the age of 3, they typically have developed enough skills and independence to transition into the preschool stage, which is considered the next phase of early childhood development.\n\nTherefore, once a child surpasses **36 months (3 years old)**, they are no longer classified as a toddler. This clarification is crucial because it aligns with the authoritative definition and helps prevent any misconceptions about the age range of toddlerhood.\n\n### Answer:\nA child is no longer considered a toddler once they reach **3 years old** (36 months)."}], "question_info": {"question": "at what age are you no longer a toddler", "passages": ["A toddler is a child 12 to 36 months old.
