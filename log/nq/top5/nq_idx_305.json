It supported democratic governments and formed military alliances, such as NATO, which included Western European nations like the United Kingdom, France, and West Germany. The U.S. also extended its influence in Asia, particularly in Japan and South Korea.\n\n2. **Soviet Union**: The USSR was the main adversary of the United States, promoting communist ideology and establishing control over Eastern Europe. By 1947, the Soviets had absorbed the Baltic states and exerted influence over countries like Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria. This control solidified the division of Europe, famously referred to as the Iron Curtain.\n\n3. **Allies of the United States**: In addition to NATO members, the U.S. had strategic partnerships with countries like Japan and South Korea, which were crucial in countering communist movements in Asia. The presence of American military forces in these regions was part of a broader strategy of containment.\n\n4. **Allies of the Soviet Union**: The Eastern Bloc consisted of countries under Soviet influence, including East Germany, Poland, Hungary, and Romania. Additionally, communist nations like China and Cuba were significant allies of the USSR, with China\u2019s emergence as a communist power in 1949 adding complexity to the Cold War dynamics.\n\n5. **Neutral Countries**: Countries such as Sweden, Austria, and Finland maintained neutrality during the Cold War. Their positions allowed them to act as mediators and provided bases for operations, influencing the superpowers' strategies without direct involvement in the conflict.\n\n6. **Nuclear Weapons Development**: The development of nuclear weapons by the United Kingdom, France, and China during the early Cold War years escalated tensions and contributed to the arms race. The concept of mutually assured destruction (MAD) became a critical aspect of the Cold War strategy, shaping the interactions between the superpowers.\n\n7. **Non-Aligned Movement**: Countries like India and Egypt sought to remain neutral and were significant players in the global political landscape. Their stance highlighted the complexities of international relations during the Cold War, as they navigated between the two superpowers.\n\nBy synthesizing this information, we can conclude that the major countries involved in the Cold War were primarily the United States and the Soviet Union, along with their respective allies in Europe and Asia, as well as the influence of neutral countries and the broader implications of nuclear proliferation.\n\n### Answer:\nThe major countries involved in the Cold War were the United States and the Soviet Union, along with their respective allies.
