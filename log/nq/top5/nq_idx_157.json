Fleet Admiral (FADM) - This rank is reserved for wartime use and has not been active since World War II.\n\nThis ranking structure provides a clear hierarchy within the U.S. Navy, with each rank having specific responsibilities and authority."}], "question_info": {"question": "what are the ranks in the us navy", "passages": ["Naval officer ranks\n", "In the United States Navy, a \"rate\" is the military rank of an enlisted sailor, indicating where an enlisted sailor stands within the chain of command, and also defining one's pay grade. However, in the U.S. Navy, only officers carry the term \"rank\", while it is proper to refer to an enlisted sailor's pay grade as \"rate.\" A similar term is \"rating\", which refers to one's area of occupational specialization within the enlisted Navy. Associated with the enlisted pay grades is a numbering system from the most junior enlisted sailor (\"E-1\") to the most senior enlisted sailor (\"E-9\"). This enlisted numbering system is the same across all five branches of the U.S. military. All E-1 through E-3 are known as Seamen. E-4 through E-6 are called petty officers. All E-7s are called chief petty officer, E-8s senior chief petty officer, and E-9s master chief petty officer. Rates are displayed on a rating badge, which is a combination of rate and rating. E-2s and E-3s have color-coded group rate marks based on their career field. Personnel in pay grade E-1, since 1996, do not have an insignia to wear.\n", "The rank hierarchy in Navy is divided in three categories: junior officers, senior officers, and star officers\u2014 the Junior officers are those in pay grade scale of [[OF-1]] to [[OF-4]] while the senior officers are in scale of [[OF-5]] and the star officers are in the pay grade scale from [[OF-6]] to above [[OF-9]].\n", "A navy will typically have two sets of ranks, one for enlisted personnel and one for officers.\n", "In various countries, particularly the United States, these may be referred to as \"star ranks\" for the number of stars worn on some rank insignia: typically one-star for brigadier general or equivalent with the addition of a star for each subsequent rank. In the United States, five stars has been the highest rank regularly attainable (excluding the Marines and Coast Guard, which have traditionally served as branches of the Navy in times of war and thus under the command of a Fleet Admiral). There also exists the specialty ranks of General of the Armies of the United States and Admiral of the Navy which at their inception were considered senior four star officers but came to be considered six-star rank after the creation of five star officers. To date only one other officer has held a six star rank in their lifetime, John J. Pershing while George Washington was posthumously promoted to the post in 1976. Additionally, Admiral George Dewey was promoted to Admiral of the Navy but died well before statute made it senior to an Admiral of the Fleet upon the latter's inception.\n"], "__answers__": ["E-8s senior chief petty officer", "E-9s master chief petty officer", "E-7s are called chief petty officer", "E-1 through E-3 are known as Seamen", "E-4 through E-6 are called petty officers"]}}
