In 2017, California ranked first in the United States in geothermal power generation. California is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, with the conjunctions of tectonic plates providing California the largest potential for producing geothermal energy generation in the country. Most of California's geothermal plants are located slightly north of San Francisco in Lake Folsom and Sonoma Counties. This is due to the geysers geothermal resource area, which produces electricity from dry steam.
