Henry, but it is important to clarify that the more widely recognized phrase is \"Life is just a bowl of cherries,\" which is the title of a popular song. This song, with music by Ray Henderson and lyrics by Lew Brown, was published in 1931 and introduced by Ethel Merman in George White's \"Scandals of 1931.\" The song's lyrics convey a sentiment that life can be sweet and enjoyable, akin to cherries, but it also acknowledges the challenges (or \"pits\") that come with it.\n\nThe song gained significant popularity, with a version recorded by Rudy Vall\u00e9e in 1931, and it was later revived by Jaye P. Morgan in 1953. Additionally, the song has been covered by various artists, including Howard McGhee and E.G. Daily, which highlights its cultural significance and lasting appeal.\n\nThus, while O. Henry is known for his insightful observations about life, the specific phrase in question is more accurately associated with the song rather than directly attributed to him. This distinction is crucial for understanding the origins and context of the phrase.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe phrase \"Life is just a bowl of cherries\" is primarily known as the title of a popular song published in 1931, with music by Ray Henderson and lyrics by Lew Brown. It was introduced by Ethel Merman and is not directly attributed to O.
