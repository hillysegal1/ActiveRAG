This suggests that there are other locations, potentially lower in elevation but farther to the east or southeast, that actually see the first sunrise.

This implies that the model should consider seasonal variations and geographical factors when determining which location sees the sun first.\n\n3. **Geographical Context**: The third passage mentions that while certain peaks may receive sunlight first, this is not universally true throughout the year.
