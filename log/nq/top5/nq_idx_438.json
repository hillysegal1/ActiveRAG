The poem emphasizes themes of resistance against death and encourages fighting against the inevitability of mortality. \n\nHowever, the phrase \"I will not go quietly\" appears in various contemporary songs, such as those by artists like Henley and Steven Curtis Chapman. This indicates that while the sentiment of resisting passivity in the face of death is present in Thomas's work, the specific wording \"I will not go quietly into the night\" may not originate from him and could be a misquote or conflation with his poem.\n\nTo clarify:\n1. **Correct Attribution**: The line \"Do not go gentle into that good night\" is attributed to Dylan Thomas, while \"I will not go quietly\" is used in modern music and is not a direct quote from Thomas's poem.\n2. **Cultural Context**: The phrase has been adopted in contemporary culture, particularly in music, which may lead to its misattribution to Thomas. This reflects a broader cultural interpretation that may not align with the original literary context.\n3. **Preventing Misunderstanding**: It is important for the model to distinguish between the literary origin of the phrase and its usage in modern contexts to avoid perpetuating inaccuracies.\n\nBy integrating this information, the model can provide a more nuanced understanding of the phrase's origins and its contemporary applications, thereby reducing the likelihood of factual errors and addressing potential model illusions.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe phrase \"I will not go quietly into the night\" is often misquoted and conflated with the line \"Do not go gentle into that good night,\" which is from a poem by Dylan Thomas. While Dylan Thomas is the author of the latter, the specific phrase \"I will not go quietly\" is used in various contemporary songs by artists like Henley and Steven Curtis Chapman. Therefore, while the sentiment of resisting passivity in the face of death is present in Thomas's work, the exact wording does not originate from him."}], "question_info": {"question": "who said i will not go quietly into the night", "passages": ["BULLET::::9. \"I Will Not Go Quietly\" (Henley, Kortchmar)\u00a0\u2013 5:41\n", "BULLET::::9. \"I Will Not Go Quietly\" (Henley, Kortchmar) \u2013 5:43\n", "BULLET::::4. \"I Will Not Go Quietly\" \u2013 Steven Curtis Chapman\n", "BULLET::::- \"'Won't Go Quietly' is a very nowadays sort of a song, aimed at the same brainial pleasure receptors as almost everything Calvin Harris has released, with some smashing lyrics about not really wanting to get close to a lady, because she's probably going to turn out to be bad news, but going ahead and snuggling up anyway.
