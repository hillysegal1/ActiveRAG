US Highway 1 (US 1) is a significant north-south highway in the United States, primarily serving the East Coast. \n\n1. **Starting Point**: US 1 begins in Key West, Florida, which is notable for being the southernmost point of the continental United States. This geographical significance establishes the highway's role in connecting the southern regions to the rest of the country.\n\n2. **Route Overview**: The highway travels north through various states, including Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine. It connects numerous major cities along this route, such as Miami, Jacksonville, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, Boston, and Portland.\n\n3. **Northern Terminus**: The northern terminus of US Highway 1 is at Fort Kent, Maine, which is located at the Canada\u2013United States border. This endpoint highlights the highway's role in facilitating cross-border travel and trade.\n\n4. **Geographical Context**: US 1 closely parallels Interstate 95 (I-95) for much of its length, particularly between Jacksonville, Florida, and Petersburg, Virginia. However, US 1 is generally located farther west (inland), which can influence travel patterns and accessibility to various regions.\n\n5. **Historical Context**: Established in 1926, US 1 has undergone various changes in routing and designation over the years, particularly in urban areas like New York City. Understanding these historical changes can provide insights into how transportation infrastructure evolves and impacts urban development.\n\n6. **Specific Routing in New York**: In New York, US 1 extends from the George Washington Bridge in Manhattan to the Connecticut state line at Port Chester. This routing reflects the highway's integration into the urban fabric of New York City and its surrounding areas.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy synthesizing this information, I can conclude that US Highway 1 serves as a vital transportation artery that connects the southernmost point of the continental United States to its northern border with Canada, facilitating travel and commerce along the East Coast.\n\n### Answer:\nUS Highway 1 starts in Key West, Florida, and ends in Fort Kent, Maine, at the Canada\u2013United States border."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhere does us highway 1 start and end\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['U.S. Route\\xa01 (US\\xa01) is a part of the U.S. Highway System that extends from Key West, Florida, to the Canada\u2013United States border at Fort Kent, Maine.
