The film features several notable voice actors, and I must identify the one who played LeFou specifically.\n\nAfter considering the cast, I remember that the character LeFou is voiced by a well-known actor who has a distinct comedic style. However, it is crucial to clarify that in the 1991 animated version, LeFou is voiced by **Gaston**, who is not the same character. The character of LeFou is actually voiced by **Jesse Corti** in the original animated film. \n\nIn contrast, Josh Gad voiced LeFou in the 2017 live-action adaptation of \"Beauty and the Beast.\" Therefore, to prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions, the model should be updated with the following information:\n- LeFou in the 1991 animated film \"Beauty and the Beast\" is voiced by **Jesse Corti**.\n- The character of Gaston, who is LeFou's master, is voiced by **Richard White**.\n\nThis enhanced understanding will help clarify any potential misconceptions and ensure accurate responses regarding the cast of the film.\n\n**Answer:**\nIn the 1991 animated film \"Beauty and the Beast,\" the character LeFou is voiced by **Jesse Corti**."}], "question_info": {"question": "who plays lefou in beauty and the beast 1991", "passages": ["BULLET::::- \"Lady of Burlesque\" (1943) as Louie Grindero\n", "Tartaglia joined the cast of \"Beauty and the Beast\" as Lumi\u00e8re on November 21, 2006 until early June 2007.\n", "At the age of 15, she was cast by director Daniel Fridell in a 2001 episode of the Swedish television series \"En klass f\u00f6r sig\", which portrayed high-school life.
