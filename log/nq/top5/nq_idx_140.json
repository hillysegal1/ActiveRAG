It is one of the two points where Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface, specifically in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\n2. **Map Orientation**: On a standard world map, which is typically oriented with north at the top, the South Pole is represented at the bottom of the map. This orientation is crucial for visualizing its location relative to other geographical features.\n\n3. **Geographical Context**: The South Pole is situated on the continent of Antarctica, which is a large landmass that encompasses the South Pole. Understanding this context helps in visualizing its location on a map.\n\n4. **Elevation and Ice Characteristics**: The South Pole is located at an elevation of 2,835 meters (9,300 feet) above sea level on a polar plateau, with an ice sheet approximately 2,700 meters (9,000 feet) thick. This information is significant for understanding the environmental conditions at the South Pole and their implications for climate and research.\n\n5. **Proximity to Open Water**: The South Pole is about 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from the nearest open sea at Bay of Whales. This distance is important for understanding logistical challenges related to access and transportation for research activities.\n\n6. **Human Presence and Research**: The United States Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station has been permanently staffed since 1956, indicating ongoing human activity and research in this extreme environment. This historical context is essential for understanding the significance of the South Pole in scientific research.\n\n7. **Differentiation of Concepts**: It is important to differentiate between the Geographic South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole, as they are defined by different criteria. This distinction aids in logical categorization and enhances understanding of related geographical concepts.\n\n8. **Causal Relationships**: Recognizing that the South Pole is a point of intersection for Earth's axis of rotation allows for inferences about its impact on climate patterns and environmental conditions. This understanding can lead to insights about global climate systems and their effects on polar regions.\n\n### Answer:\nThe South Pole is located at 90 degrees south latitude, at the center of Antarctica, which is found at the bottom of a standard world map. It sits on a polar plateau at an elevation of 2,835 meters (9,300 feet) above sea level, approximately 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from the nearest open sea at Bay of Whales.
