The potential for forensic application was proposed by Dr. Henry Faulds in 1880, which indicates an early recognition of the method's value in criminal investigations.\n\n2. **Scientific Development**: Francis Galton's contributions in the late 19th century, particularly his classification of fingerprint patterns, provided a scientific basis that facilitated the acceptance of fingerprinting in legal contexts. This classification system was crucial for the systematic application of fingerprinting in police work.\n\n3. **Adoption by Police**: The first significant implementation of fingerprinting by police occurred in 1901 when the London Scotland Yard began using fingerprints for criminal identification. This marked a pivotal moment in law enforcement history, transitioning fingerprinting from a theoretical concept to a practical tool for solving crimes.\n\n4. **Key Cases and Institutional Frameworks**: The first known use of fingerprints in a criminal case was by Juan Vucetich in Argentina in 1892, which demonstrates an early application of the method outside of Europe. In the U.S., the Scheffer case in 1902 was the first instance of identification and conviction based on fingerprint evidence, underscoring the method's growing importance in judicial processes.\n\n5. **Establishment of Formal Systems**: The creation of the Metropolitan Police Fingerprint Bureau in 1901 represents a formal institutional approach to fingerprinting, highlighting the role of organized law enforcement in adopting new technologies. This institutional support is critical for the widespread acceptance and implementation of forensic methods.\n\n6. **Causal Relationships**: The model can infer that the scientific advancements in fingerprint classification directly contributed to its legal acceptance and subsequent adoption by police forces. Understanding these causal relationships enhances the model's ability to reason about how innovations in forensic science influence law enforcement practices.\n\n### Answer:\nFingerprinting was first used by the police in 1901 when the London Scotland Yard began implementing it as a method for identifying criminals.
