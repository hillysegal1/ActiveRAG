Initially set at 28%, it was reduced to 20% and then to 19% between 2009 and 2012. This reduction was part of a broader reform aimed at making the UK more competitive globally, particularly against countries like Ireland, which has a much lower corporate tax rate of 12.5%.\n\n3. **Recent Changes**: As of October 2023, the corporate tax landscape has shifted again. The UK government announced an increase in the corporate tax rate to 25% for companies with profits exceeding \u00a3250,000, effective from April 2023. This change reflects a strategic response to economic conditions and aims to balance the need for revenue with the desire to attract and retain businesses.\n\n4. **Tiered Tax Structure**: It's important to note that there is a tiered tax structure in place. Companies with profits below \u00a350,000 will continue to be taxed at the lower rate of 19%. This tiered approach allows for support of smaller businesses while still increasing revenue from larger corporations.\n\n5. **Implications of Tax Policy**: Understanding the implications of these tax rates is crucial. The increase to 25% for larger companies may impact investment decisions, while the lower rate for smaller companies aims to foster growth and innovation. The historical context of tax inversions and competitive pressures also underscores the importance of maintaining a favorable tax environment.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The corporate tax rate is not just a number; it reflects broader economic strategies and responses to both domestic and international pressures. This understanding helps to contextualize the current rates within a framework of ongoing economic policy development.\n\n### Answer:\nAs of October 2023, the corporate tax rate in Great Britain is 25% for companies with profits over \u00a3250,000, while companies with profits below \u00a350,000 are taxed at a lower rate of 19%.

Historically, the UK corporate tax rate was reduced from 28% to 20% between 2009 and 2012, and then to 19% after 2012. \n\n3. **Recognize the Recent Increase**: As of April 2023, the corporate tax rate was set to increase to 25% for companies with profits over \u00a3250,000. This change reflects the UK government's response to economic pressures and aims to balance the need for revenue with the desire to attract investment.\n\n4. **Consider the Lower Threshold**: Companies with profits below \u00a350,000 are taxed at the lower rate of 19%. This tiered approach allows smaller businesses to benefit from a lower tax burden, which can encourage growth and investment in the early stages of business development.\n\n5. **Contextualize the Changes**: The shift from a \"worldwide tax system\" to a \"territorial tax system\" and the competitive landscape with countries like Ireland, which has a lower corporate tax rate, are important factors that influence these tax policy decisions. The UK government has aimed to create a more favorable environment for businesses to operate domestically.\n\n6. **Evaluate the Implications**: Understanding these changes helps to infer how tax policy can impact corporate behavior, investment decisions, and overall economic growth. The model can recognize that tax rates are not just numbers but are part of a broader strategy to influence economic activity.\n\n7. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Changes in tax policy can lead to feedback loops where businesses respond to tax incentives, which can influence further policy adjustments. This understanding enhances the model's ability to predict future outcomes based on current tax structures.\n\n### Answer:\nAs of October 2023, the corporate tax rate in Great Britain is 25% for companies with profits over \u00a3250,000, while companies with profits below \u00a350,000 are taxed at 19%.
