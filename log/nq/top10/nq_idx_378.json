This connection is crucial as it illustrates how Voldemort's presence is intricately tied to Quirrell's character throughout the film.\n\n2. **Voldemort's Manifestation**:\n   - The unique portrayal of Voldemort in this film, primarily through CGI, highlights the innovative storytelling techniques used to represent a character who is not physically present in the traditional sense. This method of representation allows for a deeper exploration of themes such as possession and influence.\n\n3. **Subsequent Appearances**:\n   - While Voldemort's full appearance is more developed in later films, starting with Ralph Fiennes in \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,\" understanding his initial representation in \"Philosopher's Stone\" sets the stage for his character's evolution throughout the series.\n\n4. **Character Background**:\n   - Voldemort, originally known as Tom Marvolo Riddle, is the main antagonist of the series, and his backstory is crucial for understanding the motivations behind his actions in the film.
