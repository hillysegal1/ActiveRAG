The Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, and it was signed by representatives from the thirteen colonies. Each colony had its own delegates who signed the document on behalf of their respective colonies.\n\nFor Maryland, we specifically need to identify the delegates who represented the colony at the Continental Congress during that time. The signers from Maryland included:\n\n1. **Samuel Chase**\n2. **William Paca**\n3. **Thomas Stone**\n4. **Charles Carroll of Carrollton**\n\nThese individuals were the representatives from Maryland who signed the Declaration of Independence.\n\n### Enhancements to the Reasoning Process:\n1. **Causal Relationships**: The act of signing the Declaration by these individuals was a direct response to the desire for independence from British rule. Their actions contributed to the broader movement for independence, illustrating how individual decisions can impact collective historical outcomes.\n\n2. **Roles and Contributions**: Each signer played a unique role in the independence movement. For instance, Charles Carroll was not only a signer but also one of the wealthiest men in the Americas at that time, which allowed him to financially support the revolution. This highlights the importance of socioeconomic status in political actions and decisions.\n\n3. **Historical Context**: Maryland's declaration of independence in 1776 was part of a larger national movement. Understanding this context helps to frame the significance of the signers' actions within the timeline of American history, including subsequent events like the ratification of the Articles of Confederation.\n\n4. **Characterization of Individuals**: Recognizing that Charles Carroll was the only Roman Catholic to vote on independence and sign the document provides insight into the religious dynamics of the time. This can lead to inferences about how religious beliefs influenced political actions and decisions during the revolution.\n\n5. **Linking Events and Outcomes**: The signing of the Declaration was not just a symbolic act; it had real consequences, leading to Maryland's independence and shaping the future political landscape of the United States. This connection between actions and outcomes enhances the model's ability to make logical connections between cause and effect.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe extracted and enhanced information provides a comprehensive understanding of the signers of the Declaration of Independence for Maryland. By analyzing the relationships between individual actions, historical context, and broader outcomes, we can better appreciate the complexities of this pivotal moment in American history.\n\n### Answer:\nSamuel Chase, William Paca, Thomas Stone, and Charles Carroll of Carrollton signed the Declaration of Independence for Maryland.
