US Highway 1 is a significant north-south highway in the United States, primarily serving the East Coast. It is known for its scenic views and historical importance.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: \n   - US Highway 1 begins in **Key West, Florida**, which is recognized as the southernmost point of the continental United States. This detail is consistent across multiple authoritative sources.\n\n2. **Route Description**: \n   - The highway travels north through several states, including Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine. It is important to note that US 1 runs parallel to Interstate 95 (I-95) for much of its length, providing a vital route for both local and long-distance travel along the eastern seaboard.\n\n3. **Ending Point**: \n   - The northern terminus of US Highway 1 is at **Fort Kent, Maine**, at the Canada\u2013United States border. This is a crucial detail that corrects the previous mention of Houlton, Maine, which is not the endpoint of US 1.\n\n4. **Route Characteristics**: \n   - US 1 connects major cities along the East Coast, including Miami, Jacksonville, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, Boston, and Portland. This information highlights the highway's importance as an arterial road.\n\n5. **Historical Context**: \n   - The U.S. Highway system was established in 1926, and US 1 has evolved over time, particularly in its routing through states like New York. Understanding this historical context can provide insights into the highway's significance.\n\n6. **Geographical Context**: \n   - US 1 serves local traffic in various areas, especially in Virginia, where it is paralleled by Interstate Highways. This aspect emphasizes the highway's role in regional connectivity.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe enhanced reasoning process confirms that US Highway 1 starts in Key West, Florida, and ends at Fort Kent, Maine, at the Canadian border. This clarification corrects the previous error regarding the northern terminus and reinforces the highway's significance as a major route along the East Coast.\n\n### Answer:\nUS Highway 1 starts in Key West, Florida, and ends at Fort Kent, Maine, at the Canada\u2013United States border."}], "question_info": {"question": "where does us highway 1 start and end", "passages": ["U.S. Route\u00a01 (US\u00a01) is a part of the U.S. Highway System that extends from Key West, Florida, to the Canada\u2013United States border at Fort Kent, Maine.
