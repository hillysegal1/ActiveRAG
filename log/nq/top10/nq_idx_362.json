Between 1937 and 1950 merengue music was promoted internationally by Dominican groups like Chapuseaux and Damiron \"Los Reyes del Merengue\", Joseito Mateo, and others. Radio, television, and international media popularized it further. Some well-known merengue performers include Johnny Ventura, singer/songwriter Juan Luis Guerra, Fernando Villalona, Eddy Herrera, Sergio Vargas, To\u00f1o Rosario, Milly Quezada, and Chich\u00ed Peralta. Merengue became popular in the United States, mostly on the East Coast, during the 1980s and 1990s, when many Dominican artists, among them Victor Roque y La Gran Manzana, Henry Hierro, Zacarias Ferreira, Aventura, and Milly Jocelyn Y Los Vecinos, residing in the U.S. (particularly New York) started performing in the Latin club scene and gained radio airplay. The emergence of \"bachata\", along with an increase in the number of Dominicans living among other Latino groups in New York, New Jersey, Florida and Massachusetts contributed to Dominican music's overall growth in popularity.\n", "Musically, the Dominican Republic is known for the world popular musical style and genre called \"merengue\", a type of lively, fast-paced rhythm and dance music consisting of a tempo of about 120 to 160 beats per minute (though it varies) based on musical elements like drums, brass, chorded instruments, and accordion, as well as some elements unique to the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, such as the \"tambora\" and \"g\u00fcira\".\n", "Hispanic rhythmic\n", "The Dominican National Anthem is the national anthem of the Dominican Republic. Its music was composed by Jos\u00e9 Rufino Reyes Siancas (1835\u20131905), and its lyrics were authored by Emilio Prud\u2019Homme (1856\u20131932).\n", "Like the other Francophone musics of the Lesser Antilles, Dominican folk music is a hybrid of African and European elements. The quadrille is an important symbol of French Antillean culture, and is, on Dominica, typically accompanied by a kind of ensemble called a \"jing ping\" band. In addition, Dominica's folk tradition includes folk songs called \"b\u00e9l\u00e9\", traditional storytelling called \"kont\", masquerade, children's and work songs, and Carnival music.\n", "By the beginning of the 1960s, calypso and Trinidadian steelpan became the most popular styles of music on Dominica, replacing traditional Carnival music like chant\u00e9 mas and lapo kabwit, particularly in the capital Roseau. Many of the traditional carnival songs were performed in the new calypso beat. Calypsonians and calypso monarch competitions emerged and became extremely popular. It was in the 1960s that the trend towards drawing on original music, traditional music and songs of Dominica began. This was probably best exemplified by the music of the Gaylords and to a lesser extent, De Boys and Dem. Gaylords unleashed a string of hits such as \"DouvanJou\", \"Ti Mako\", songs in Dominican Creole French as well as powerful nationalist songs in English, as \"Lovely Dominica\" and \"Pray for the Blackman\". These songs were performed to calypso rhythms and later the new reggae beat coming out of Jamaica.\n", "\"Dominant rhythm\" is a metaphor used in conjunction with city rhythm. It is the most powerful rhythm in a city, enabling the shaping and forming of time and space, both within the city and in faraway places through networks.\n", "Some of the Dominican Republic's important symbols are the flag, the coat of arms, and the national anthem, titled \"Himno Nacional\". The flag has a large white cross that divides it into four quarters. Two quarters are red and two are blue. Red represents the blood shed by the liberators. Blue expresses God's protection over the nation. The white cross symbolizes the struggle of the liberators to bequeath future generations a free nation. An alternative interpretation is that blue represents the ideals of progress and liberty, whereas white symbolizes peace and unity among Dominicans.\n", "National Anthem of the Dominican Republic\n"], "__answers__": ["merengue", "bachata"]}}
