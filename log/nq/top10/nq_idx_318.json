However, the mention of the First Lady suggests that the model may need to be updated to reflect that Edgar Lungu was the president as of January 2015.\n\n3. **Updating Knowledge**: To prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions, the model should be updated with the following information:\n   - As of January 2015, the president of Zambia was Edgar Lungu. \n   - The model should also be aware that political situations can change, and it should verify the current president against the latest authoritative sources.\n\nIn summary, the key takeaway from the passages is the implication that Edgar Lungu was the president of Zambia as of January 2015, which should be noted for updating the model's knowledge.
