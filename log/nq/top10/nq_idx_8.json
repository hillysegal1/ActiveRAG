The first movie in the series is based on the book \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" (known as \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" in the United States). This adaptation was produced by Warner Bros. and marks the beginning of a significant film franchise.\n\nNext, I will consider the timeline of the Harry Potter franchise, which began with the publication of the first book in 1997. The film adaptation typically follows a few years after the book's release, and in this case, the first movie was released four years after the book's publication.\n\nFrom the retrieved knowledge, I confirm that \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" was released on **16 November 2001**. This date is crucial as it not only signifies the start of the film adaptations but also represents a pivotal moment in cinematic history, as the film achieved significant commercial success, grossing $90 million in its opening weekend.\n\nAdditionally, understanding the broader context of the Harry Potter franchise enhances this reasoning. The series has had a profound cultural impact, contributing to the popularity of fantasy films and establishing a new standard for adaptations of beloved literary works. The franchise has expanded over the years, with subsequent films released annually or biennially, culminating in a total of eight films based on the seven books.\n\nThe directorial contributions also play a role in the film's success.
