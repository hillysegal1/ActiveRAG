The earliest known settlers were Polynesians, who arrived in canoes from other Pacific islands. This migration is estimated to have occurred between 300 AD and 800 AD, with significant waves of settlement during this period. \n\nThe model can enhance its reasoning by recognizing that these early settlers were not just a single group but came from various Polynesian islands, including the Marquesas, Tonga, and Samoa. This diversity among the early settlers suggests a complex interaction of cultures that laid the foundation for Hawaii's unique cultural landscape.\n\nFollowing the Polynesians, there were subsequent waves of immigration, particularly in the 19th century, driven by labor demands for sugar plantations. This included significant numbers of Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, and Filipino immigrants. The arrival of these groups marked a transformative period in Hawaii's demographic and cultural composition.\n\nThe model can also infer causal relationships from this timeline. For example, the arrival of laborers from different cultures led to demographic changes and the establishment of new communities, such as Chinatown, which reflects the integration of various immigrant groups. Additionally, the economic motivations behind these migrations\u2014such as the labor needs of the sugar industry\u2014highlight how economic conditions can drive immigration patterns.\n\nFurthermore, the arrival of American missionaries in 1820 introduced Western cultural influences, which may have affected subsequent immigration trends and the social dynamics within Hawaii. Understanding these interdependencies allows for a more nuanced analysis of how immigration shapes societal structures and cultural identities.\n\n### Answer:\nThe first immigrants came to Hawaii around 300 AD to 800 AD, primarily consisting of Polynesians from various islands in the Pacific.
