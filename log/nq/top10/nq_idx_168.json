The word \"Celsius\" is derived from the name of the Swedish astronomer and physicist, Anders Celsius, who was born in 1701.\n2. Anders Celsius is best known for developing the Celsius temperature scale, which was introduced in 1742. This scale defines 0 degrees Celsius as the freezing point of water and 100 degrees Celsius as the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure.\n3. The term \"Celsius\" was adopted in honor of Anders Celsius after his death, recognizing his significant contributions to the field of temperature measurement.\n4. The passages retrieved mention \"Celsus,\" which could lead to confusion. However, it is important to clarify that \"Celsus\" refers to a different historical figure, a Roman scientist and physician, and is not directly related to the term \"Celsius.\"\n5. The transition from the term \"centigrade\" to \"Celsius\" in scientific contexts, particularly in English-speaking countries, occurred in the 1980s, as noted in the passages. This reflects the evolution of terminology in scientific discourse.\n\nBy incorporating this information, the model's knowledge is updated to clearly differentiate between \"Celsius\" and \"Celsus,\" ensuring accuracy in the context of temperature measurement.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe word \"Celsius\" originates from the name of the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius, who developed the Celsius temperature scale in the 18th century. The scale, introduced in 1742, defines 0 degrees Celsius as the freezing point of water and 100 degrees Celsius as the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure.
