It was first released in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other regions in early 2016. The game was then made available in the United States shortly after its initial release. To determine the exact date of the US release, I will recall the timeline of the game's launch and any announcements made by Supercell regarding its availability in different regions.\n\nAnswer:\nClash Royale was released in the United States on March 2, 2016.\nTo update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions. \nI retrieved some knowledge that may update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions\nNote that these passages are retrieved from the most authoritative knowledge repositories, so they are assumed to be correct.\nknowledge:\nBased on the retrieved passages, the relevant information regarding the release of \"Clash Royale\" is as follows:\n\n1. **Global Release Date**: The game \"Clash Royale\" was released globally on March 2, 2016. \n2. **Contextual Information**: It is noted that \"Clash Royale\" is a mobile video game developed and published by Supercell and combines elements from collectible card games, tower defense, and multiplayer online battle arena.\n\nHowever, the passages do not specify a distinct release date for the United States, which could be an important detail for a comprehensive understanding of the game's launch timeline. \n\nTo address potential model illusions and enhance the accuracy of the model's knowledge, it would be beneficial to confirm whether the global release date of March 2, 2016, also applies to the United States or if there was a specific release date for that region. \n\nIn summary, the key information extracted is:\n- \"Clash Royale\" was released globally on March 2, 2016.\n- There is no specific mention of a different release date for the United States in the provided passages.\n\nTo prevent factual errors, it would be prudent to verify whether the March 2, 2016, date applies to the U.S. or if there was a separate release date for that market.\nPlease verify the above reasoning process for errors, \nthen enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to update the language model's knowledge, prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions.\nAfterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n\nGeneration Format:\nknowledge enhanced inference process:\nAnswer:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Knowledge Enhanced Inference Process:**\n\nTo determine the release date of \"Clash Royale\" in the United States, we start with the information that the game was developed and published by Supercell and combines elements from collectible card games, tower defense, and multiplayer online battle arena genres. The retrieved passages indicate that \"Clash Royale\" was released globally on March 2, 2016. \n\nWhile the passages do not explicitly mention a separate release date for the United States, it is common for global releases to include major markets like the U.S. on the same date. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the U.S. release coincided with the global release date unless otherwise specified.\n\nTo enhance the reasoning process, we can consider the following:\n1. The global release date of March 2, 2016, is a strong indicator that the U.S. release likely occurred on the same day.\n2. The lack of a specific mention of a different U.S. release date in the retrieved passages suggests that March 2, 2016, is indeed applicable to the U.S. market.\n\nThus, based on the available information and the context of typical release practices, we can confidently assert that \"Clash Royale\" was released in the United States on the same date as its global release.\n\n**Answer:**\nClash Royale was released in the United States on March 2, 2016."}], "question_info": {"question": "when was clash royale released in the us", "passages": [" clash royale\n", "Clash Royale is a video game developed and published by Supercell.
