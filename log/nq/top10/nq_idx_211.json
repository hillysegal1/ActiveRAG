Acidity increases the conductivity, which produces a reflection. Reflections due to volcanic layers are possible at any depth.\\n', \"Wet deposition of acids occurs when any form of precipitation (rain, snow, and so on.) removes acids from the atmosphere and delivers it to the Earth's surface. This can result from the deposition of acids produced in the raindrops (see aqueous phase chemistry above) or by the precipitation removing the acids either in clouds or below clouds. Wet removal of both gases and aerosols are both of importance for wet deposition.\\n\", 'In high rainfall areas, soils tend to acidity as the basic cations are forced off the soil colloids by the mass action of hydrogen ions from the rain against those attached to the colloids. High rainfall rates can then wash the nutrients out, leaving the soil inhabited only by those organisms which are particularly efficient to uptake nutrients in very acid conditions, like in tropical rainforests. Once the colloids are saturated with H, the addition of any more hydrogen ions or aluminum hydroxyl cations drives the pH even lower (more acidic) as the soil has been left with no buffering capacity. In areas of extreme rainfall and high temperatures, the clay and humus may be washed out, further reducing the buffering capacity of the soil. In low rainfall areas, unleached calcium pushes pH to 8.5 and with the addition of exchangeable sodium, soils may reach pH\\xa010. Beyond a pH of 9, plant growth is reduced. High pH results in low micro-nutrient mobility, but water-soluble chelates of those nutrients can correct the deficit. Sodium can be reduced by the addition of gypsum (calcium sulphate) as calcium adheres to clay more tightly than does sodium causing sodium to be pushed into the soil water solution where it can be washed out by an abundance of water.\\n', 'A weakly basic solvent has less tendency than a strongly basic one to accept a proton. Similarly a weak acid has less tendency to donate protons than a strong acid. As a result, a strong acid such as perchloric acid exhibits more strongly acidic properties than a weak acid such as acetic acid when dissolved in a weakly basic solvent. On the other hand, all acids tend to become indistinguishable in strength when dissolved in strongly basic solvents owing to the greater affinity of strong bases for protons. This is called the leveling effect. Strong bases are leveling solvents for acids, weak bases are differentiating solvents for acids.\\n', 'The source of almost all fresh water is precipitation from the atmosphere, in the form of mist, rain and snow. Fresh water falling as mist, rain or snow contains materials dissolved from the atmosphere and material from the sea and land over which the rain bearing clouds have traveled. In industrialized areas rain is typically acidic because of dissolved oxides of sulfur and nitrogen formed from burning of fossil fuels in cars, factories, trains and aircraft and from the atmospheric emissions of industry. In some cases this acid rain results in pollution of lakes and rivers.\\n', 'Acid rain is a rain or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low pH). It can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals and infrastructure. Acid rain is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids. Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results. Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by lightning strikes, and sulfur dioxide is produced by volcanic eruptions. Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms, causing paint to peel, corrosion of steel structures such as bridges, and weathering of stone buildings and statues as well as having impacts on human health.\\n', 'The combustion process of petroleum , coal , and wood is responsible for increased occurrence of acid rain. Combustion causes an increased amount of nitrous oxide s, along with sulfur dioxide from the sulfur in the oil. These by-products combine with water in the atmosphere to create acid rain. The increased concentrations of nitrates and other acidic substances have significant effects on the pH levels of rainfall. Data samples analyzed from the United States and Europe from the past 100 years and showed an increase in nitrous oxide emissions from combustion. The emissions were large enough to acidify the rainfall. The acid rain has adverse impacts on the larger ecosystem. For example acid rain can kill trees , acidified lakes and kill fish. Coral reefs are also destroyed from the acidified rainfall of acid rain. Acid rain also leads to the corrosion of machinery and structures (large amounts of capital) and to the slow destruction of archeological structures like the marble ruins of Rome and Greece.\\n', 'Cones can also be found on snow patches. Many snow patches contain a certain amount of debris on them, blown in on the wind. Typically, this is a course grained sand or organic material. The sand is quite porous which makes it a poor conductor of heat. During extreme wind events, this sand or organic matter is carried onto the snow patch. The snow lying underneath the porous sand is protected from the heat and does not erode away. The snow not protected by a layer of sand or organic matter begins to erode through ablation. The protected areas accumulate more sand and eventually take on a conical shape. The core of snow is protected from ablation while the surrounding snow patch continues to melt. This is another way dirt cones can form.\\n', 'Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are naturally released from volcanoes, organic compounds in the soil, wetlands, and marine systems, but the majority of these compounds come from the combustion of coal, oil, gasoline, and the smelting of ores containing sulfur. These substances dissolve in atmospheric moisture and enter lentic systems as acid rain. Lakes and ponds that contain bedrock that is rich in carbonates have a natural buffer, resulting in no alteration of pH. Systems without this bedrock, however, are very sensitive to acid inputs because they have a low neutralizing capacity, resulting in pH declines even with only small inputs of acid. At a pH of 5\u20136 algal species diversity and biomass decrease considerably, leading to an increase in water transparency \u2013 a characteristic feature of acidified lakes. As the pH continues lower, all fauna becomes less diverse. The most significant feature is the disruption of fish reproduction. Thus, the population is eventually composed of few, old individuals that eventually die and leave the systems without fishes. Acid rain has been especially harmful to lakes in Scandinavia, western Scotland, west Wales and the north eastern United States.\\n', 'Certain parent materials also contribute to soil acidification. Granites and their allied igneous rocks are called \"acidic\" because they have a lot of free quartz, which produces silicic acid on weathering. Also, they have relatively low amounts of calcium and magnesium. Some sedimentary rocks such as shale and coal are rich in sulfides, which, when hydrated and oxidized, produce sulfuric acid which is much stronger than silicic acid. Many coal soils are too acidic to support vigorous plant growth, and coal gives off strong precursors to acid rain when it is burned. Marine clays are also sulfide-rich in many cases, and such clays become very acidic if they are drained to an oxidizing state.\\n']\n\nTask Description:\nPlease extract content that may be unfamiliar to the model from these passages, \nwhich can provide the model with relevant background and unknown knowledge and concepts, \nhelping it better understand the question. and analyze the role of these contents.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To address the question regarding \"rain, sleet, or snow that contains a high concentration of acids,\" we can extract relevant content from the provided passages that may enhance understanding of the concept of acid precipitation, commonly referred to as \"acid rain.\" Below are the key points extracted from the passages, along with an analysis of their relevance:\n\n### Extracted Content:\n\n1. **Definition of Acid Rain**:\n   - \"Acid rain is a rain or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low pH).\"\n   - This definition establishes a clear understanding of what acid rain is, emphasizing its acidity and the presence of hydrogen ions.\n\n2. **Causes of Acid Rain**:\n   - \"Acid rain is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids.\"\n   - This passage explains the chemical processes that lead to the formation of acid rain, highlighting the role of industrial emissions and natural sources.\n\n3. **Effects of Acid Rain**:\n   - \"Acid rain can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals, and infrastructure.\"\n   - This statement underscores the environmental and structural impacts of acid rain, which is crucial for understanding its significance.\n\n4. **Sources of Acids**:\n   - \"Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are naturally released from volcanoes, organic compounds in the soil, wetlands, and marine systems, but the majority of these compounds come from the combustion of coal, oil, gasoline, and the smelting of ores containing sulfur.\"\n   - This passage provides insight into both natural and anthropogenic sources of the acids that contribute to acid rain.\n\n5. **Geographical Impact**:\n   - \"Acid rain has been especially harmful to lakes in Scandinavia, western Scotland, west Wales, and the northeastern United States.\"\n   - This information highlights the geographical areas most affected by acid rain, which can be important for understanding regional environmental issues.\n\n6. **Chemical Composition**:\n   - \"High concentrations of volcanic acids, e.g., sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid, increase the conductivity of the surface snow over which they are deposited.\"\n   - This detail connects the concept of acid rain to its effects on snow, indicating that acid precipitation can alter the properties of snow and ice.\n\n### Analysis of the Role of Extracted Content:\n\n- **Clarification of Terminology**: The definition of acid rain helps clarify the terminology used in the question, ensuring that the model understands that the term encompasses various forms of precipitation, including rain, sleet, and snow.\n\n- **Understanding Causes and Effects**: By explaining the causes of acid rain and its effects on the environment, the extracted content provides a comprehensive background that is essential for grasping the broader implications of acid precipitation.\n\n- **Contextual Relevance**: The mention of specific geographical areas affected by acid rain adds context, allowing for a better understanding of the real-world significance of the phenomenon.\n\n- **Chemical Insights**: The discussion of chemical processes and sources of acids enriches the model's knowledge of the environmental chemistry involved, which is crucial for understanding how acid rain forms and its potential impacts.\n\nIn summary, the extracted content enhances the model's understanding of acid rain by providing definitions, causes, effects, and contextual information, all of which are relevant to answering the original question about acidic precipitation."}, {"role": "user", "content": " Here is an answer generated by a language model with the reasoning process.\nquestion:\nrain sleet or snow that contains a high concentration of acids is called\nanswer:\nReasoning process: \nRain, sleet, or snow that contains a high concentration of acids is commonly referred to as \"acid precipitation\" or \"acid rain.\" This phenomenon occurs when pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), are released into the atmosphere, where they react with water vapor, oxygen, and other chemicals to form sulfuric and nitric acids.

This acidity is primarily caused by the dissolution of sulfuric and nitric acids in the precipitation.\n\n2. **Chemical Formation**:\n   - Acid rain is formed when pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are emitted into the atmosphere.

Once in the atmosphere, these pollutants react with water vapor, oxygen, and other chemicals, leading to the formation of sulfuric and nitric acids.\n\n3. **Environmental Impact**:\n   - The harmful effects of acid rain extend to various ecosystems. Acid precipitation can lead to soil degradation, harm aquatic life by lowering the pH of water bodies, and damage infrastructure, including buildings and monuments. The ecological consequences can disrupt plant growth and aquatic ecosystems, leading to a decline in biodiversity.\n\n4. **Geographical Context**:\n   - Certain regions, particularly those with high industrial activity or specific geological features, are more susceptible to the effects of acid rain.

The interconnectedness of human activities and natural processes that lead to acid rain underscores the importance of environmental regulations and the need for continued efforts to mitigate its impacts.\n\n### Answer:\nAcid precipitation (or acid rain)."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nrain sleet or snow that contains a high concentration of acids is called\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['BULLET::::- High concentrations of volcanic acids, e.g., sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid, increase the conductivity of the surface snow over which they are deposited.

This can result from the deposition of acids produced in the raindrops (see aqueous phase chemistry above) or by the precipitation removing the acids either in clouds or below clouds. Wet removal of both gases and aerosols are both of importance for wet deposition.\\n\", 'In high rainfall areas, soils tend to acidity as the basic cations are forced off the soil colloids by the mass action of hydrogen ions from the rain against those attached to the colloids. High rainfall rates can then wash the nutrients out, leaving the soil inhabited only by those organisms which are particularly efficient to uptake nutrients in very acid conditions, like in tropical rainforests. Once the colloids are saturated with H, the addition of any more hydrogen ions or aluminum hydroxyl cations drives the pH even lower (more acidic) as the soil has been left with no buffering capacity. In areas of extreme rainfall and high temperatures, the clay and humus may be washed out, further reducing the buffering capacity of the soil. In low rainfall areas, unleached calcium pushes pH to 8.5 and with the addition of exchangeable sodium, soils may reach pH\\xa010. Beyond a pH of 9, plant growth is reduced. High pH results in low micro-nutrient mobility, but water-soluble chelates of those nutrients can correct the deficit. Sodium can be reduced by the addition of gypsum (calcium sulphate) as calcium adheres to clay more tightly than does sodium causing sodium to be pushed into the soil water solution where it can be washed out by an abundance of water.\\n', 'A weakly basic solvent has less tendency than a strongly basic one to accept a proton. Similarly a weak acid has less tendency to donate protons than a strong acid. As a result, a strong acid such as perchloric acid exhibits more strongly acidic properties than a weak acid such as acetic acid when dissolved in a weakly basic solvent. On the other hand, all acids tend to become indistinguishable in strength when dissolved in strongly basic solvents owing to the greater affinity of strong bases for protons. This is called the leveling effect. Strong bases are leveling solvents for acids, weak bases are differentiating solvents for acids.\\n', 'The source of almost all fresh water is precipitation from the atmosphere, in the form of mist, rain and snow. Fresh water falling as mist, rain or snow contains materials dissolved from the atmosphere and material from the sea and land over which the rain bearing clouds have traveled. In industrialized areas rain is typically acidic because of dissolved oxides of sulfur and nitrogen formed from burning of fossil fuels in cars, factories, trains and aircraft and from the atmospheric emissions of industry. In some cases this acid rain results in pollution of lakes and rivers.\\n', 'Acid rain is a rain or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low pH). It can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals and infrastructure. Acid rain is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids. Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results. Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by lightning strikes, and sulfur dioxide is produced by volcanic eruptions. Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms, causing paint to peel, corrosion of steel structures such as bridges, and weathering of stone buildings and statues as well as having impacts on human health.\\n', 'The combustion process of petroleum , coal , and wood is responsible for increased occurrence of acid rain. Combustion causes an increased amount of nitrous oxide s, along with sulfur dioxide from the sulfur in the oil. These by-products combine with water in the atmosphere to create acid rain. The increased concentrations of nitrates and other acidic substances have significant effects on the pH levels of rainfall. Data samples analyzed from the United States and Europe from the past 100 years and showed an increase in nitrous oxide emissions from combustion. The emissions were large enough to acidify the rainfall. The acid rain has adverse impacts on the larger ecosystem. For example acid rain can kill trees , acidified lakes and kill fish. Coral reefs are also destroyed from the acidified rainfall of acid rain. Acid rain also leads to the corrosion of machinery and structures (large amounts of capital) and to the slow destruction of archeological structures like the marble ruins of Rome and Greece.\\n', 'Cones can also be found on snow patches. Many snow patches contain a certain amount of debris on them, blown in on the wind. Typically, this is a course grained sand or organic material. The sand is quite porous which makes it a poor conductor of heat. During extreme wind events, this sand or organic matter is carried onto the snow patch. The snow lying underneath the porous sand is protected from the heat and does not erode away. The snow not protected by a layer of sand or organic matter begins to erode through ablation. The protected areas accumulate more sand and eventually take on a conical shape. The core of snow is protected from ablation while the surrounding snow patch continues to melt. This is another way dirt cones can form.\\n', 'Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are naturally released from volcanoes, organic compounds in the soil, wetlands, and marine systems, but the majority of these compounds come from the combustion of coal, oil, gasoline, and the smelting of ores containing sulfur. These substances dissolve in atmospheric moisture and enter lentic systems as acid rain. Lakes and ponds that contain bedrock that is rich in carbonates have a natural buffer, resulting in no alteration of pH. Systems without this bedrock, however, are very sensitive to acid inputs because they have a low neutralizing capacity, resulting in pH declines even with only small inputs of acid. At a pH of 5\u20136 algal species diversity and biomass decrease considerably, leading to an increase in water transparency \u2013 a characteristic feature of acidified lakes. As the pH continues lower, all fauna becomes less diverse. The most significant feature is the disruption of fish reproduction. Thus, the population is eventually composed of few, old individuals that eventually die and leave the systems without fishes. Acid rain has been especially harmful to lakes in Scandinavia, western Scotland, west Wales and the north eastern United States.\\n', 'Certain parent materials also contribute to soil acidification. Granites and their allied igneous rocks are called \"acidic\" because they have a lot of free quartz, which produces silicic acid on weathering. Also, they have relatively low amounts of calcium and magnesium. Some sedimentary rocks such as shale and coal are rich in sulfides, which, when hydrated and oxidized, produce sulfuric acid which is much stronger than silicic acid. Many coal soils are too acidic to support vigorous plant growth, and coal gives off strong precursors to acid rain when it is burned. Marine clays are also sulfide-rich in many cases, and such clays become very acidic if they are drained to an oxidizing state.\\n']\n\nTask Description:\nPlease extract content from these passages that can help enhance the model's causal reasoning and logical inference abilities.\nconsolidate these contents, and analyze how the selected information may impact the improvement of the model's causal reasoning and logical inference capabilities.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To address the question regarding the term for precipitation (rain, sleet, or snow) that contains a high concentration of acids, we can extract relevant information from the provided passages.

This includes rain, sleet, and snow that contain elevated levels of hydrogen ions, indicating a high concentration of acids.\n\n2. **Formation Mechanism**: Acid rain forms when pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are emitted into the atmosphere. These pollutants can originate from various sources, including industrial activities, vehicle emissions, and natural events like volcanic eruptions. Once in the atmosphere, these gases react with water vapor, oxygen, and other chemicals to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3), which are then deposited back to the Earth's surface through precipitation.\n\n3. **Environmental Consequences**: The impacts of acid rain are significant and multifaceted. Acid rain can lead to the acidification of lakes and rivers, harming aquatic life by disrupting reproductive cycles and reducing biodiversity. It can also damage forests by leaching essential nutrients from the soil and harming tree health. Additionally, acid rain can corrode buildings and infrastructure, particularly those made of limestone and marble, leading to increased maintenance costs and structural degradation.\n\n4. **Wet Deposition Process**: Wet deposition is the process through which acids are removed from the atmosphere by precipitation. This can occur when rain or snow falls through polluted air, capturing acids and bringing them to the ground. This process highlights the interconnectedness of atmospheric chemistry and terrestrial ecosystems.\n\n5. **Broader Implications**: Understanding acid rain within the context of climate change and environmental policy is crucial. As emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are regulated, the frequency and intensity of acid rain can be mitigated, leading to improved environmental health. This understanding allows for better predictive capabilities regarding the future state of ecosystems and the effectiveness of policy measures.\n\n### Enhanced Reasoning:\nBy integrating the above points, we can enhance the model's causal reasoning and logical inference capabilities. The model can now better understand the complex interactions between human activities, atmospheric chemistry, and ecological health. It can also make informed predictions about the consequences of regulatory actions on acid rain and its environmental impacts.\n\n### Answer:\nAcid precipitation (or acid rain) is the term used to describe rain, sleet, or snow that contains a high concentration of acids, primarily formed from the reaction of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides with atmospheric moisture."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nrain sleet or snow that contains a high concentration of acids is called\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['BULLET::::- High concentrations of volcanic acids, e.g., sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid, increase the conductivity of the surface snow over which they are deposited.

Wet removal of both gases and aerosols are both of importance for wet deposition.\n", "In high rainfall areas, soils tend to acidity as the basic cations are forced off the soil colloids by the mass action of hydrogen ions from the rain against those attached to the colloids. High rainfall rates can then wash the nutrients out, leaving the soil inhabited only by those organisms which are particularly efficient to uptake nutrients in very acid conditions, like in tropical rainforests. Once the colloids are saturated with H, the addition of any more hydrogen ions or aluminum hydroxyl cations drives the pH even lower (more acidic) as the soil has been left with no buffering capacity. In areas of extreme rainfall and high temperatures, the clay and humus may be washed out, further reducing the buffering capacity of the soil. In low rainfall areas, unleached calcium pushes pH to 8.5 and with the addition of exchangeable sodium, soils may reach pH\u00a010. Beyond a pH of 9, plant growth is reduced. High pH results in low micro-nutrient mobility, but water-soluble chelates of those nutrients can correct the deficit. Sodium can be reduced by the addition of gypsum (calcium sulphate) as calcium adheres to clay more tightly than does sodium causing sodium to be pushed into the soil water solution where it can be washed out by an abundance of water.\n", "A weakly basic solvent has less tendency than a strongly basic one to accept a proton. Similarly a weak acid has less tendency to donate protons than a strong acid. As a result, a strong acid such as perchloric acid exhibits more strongly acidic properties than a weak acid such as acetic acid when dissolved in a weakly basic solvent. On the other hand, all acids tend to become indistinguishable in strength when dissolved in strongly basic solvents owing to the greater affinity of strong bases for protons. This is called the leveling effect. Strong bases are leveling solvents for acids, weak bases are differentiating solvents for acids.\n", "The source of almost all fresh water is precipitation from the atmosphere, in the form of mist, rain and snow. Fresh water falling as mist, rain or snow contains materials dissolved from the atmosphere and material from the sea and land over which the rain bearing clouds have traveled. In industrialized areas rain is typically acidic because of dissolved oxides of sulfur and nitrogen formed from burning of fossil fuels in cars, factories, trains and aircraft and from the atmospheric emissions of industry. In some cases this acid rain results in pollution of lakes and rivers.\n", "Acid rain is a rain or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low pH). It can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals and infrastructure. Acid rain is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids. Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results. Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by lightning strikes, and sulfur dioxide is produced by volcanic eruptions. Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms, causing paint to peel, corrosion of steel structures such as bridges, and weathering of stone buildings and statues as well as having impacts on human health.\n", "The combustion process of petroleum , coal , and wood is responsible for increased occurrence of acid rain. Combustion causes an increased amount of nitrous oxide s, along with sulfur dioxide from the sulfur in the oil. These by-products combine with water in the atmosphere to create acid rain. The increased concentrations of nitrates and other acidic substances have significant effects on the pH levels of rainfall. Data samples analyzed from the United States and Europe from the past 100 years and showed an increase in nitrous oxide emissions from combustion. The emissions were large enough to acidify the rainfall. The acid rain has adverse impacts on the larger ecosystem. For example acid rain can kill trees , acidified lakes and kill fish. Coral reefs are also destroyed from the acidified rainfall of acid rain. Acid rain also leads to the corrosion of machinery and structures (large amounts of capital) and to the slow destruction of archeological structures like the marble ruins of Rome and Greece.\n", "Cones can also be found on snow patches. Many snow patches contain a certain amount of debris on them, blown in on the wind. Typically, this is a course grained sand or organic material. The sand is quite porous which makes it a poor conductor of heat. During extreme wind events, this sand or organic matter is carried onto the snow patch. The snow lying underneath the porous sand is protected from the heat and does not erode away. The snow not protected by a layer of sand or organic matter begins to erode through ablation. The protected areas accumulate more sand and eventually take on a conical shape. The core of snow is protected from ablation while the surrounding snow patch continues to melt. This is another way dirt cones can form.\n", "Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are naturally released from volcanoes, organic compounds in the soil, wetlands, and marine systems, but the majority of these compounds come from the combustion of coal, oil, gasoline, and the smelting of ores containing sulfur. These substances dissolve in atmospheric moisture and enter lentic systems as acid rain. Lakes and ponds that contain bedrock that is rich in carbonates have a natural buffer, resulting in no alteration of pH. Systems without this bedrock, however, are very sensitive to acid inputs because they have a low neutralizing capacity, resulting in pH declines even with only small inputs of acid. At a pH of 5\u20136 algal species diversity and biomass decrease considerably, leading to an increase in water transparency \u2013 a characteristic feature of acidified lakes. As the pH continues lower, all fauna becomes less diverse. The most significant feature is the disruption of fish reproduction. Thus, the population is eventually composed of few, old individuals that eventually die and leave the systems without fishes. Acid rain has been especially harmful to lakes in Scandinavia, western Scotland, west Wales and the north eastern United States.\n", "Certain parent materials also contribute to soil acidification. Granites and their allied igneous rocks are called \"acidic\" because they have a lot of free quartz, which produces silicic acid on weathering. Also, they have relatively low amounts of calcium and magnesium. Some sedimentary rocks such as shale and coal are rich in sulfides, which, when hydrated and oxidized, produce sulfuric acid which is much stronger than silicic acid. Many coal soils are too acidic to support vigorous plant growth, and coal gives off strong precursors to acid rain when it is burned. Marine clays are also sulfide-rich in many cases, and such clays become very acidic if they are drained to an oxidizing state.\n"], "__answers__": ["Acid rain", "`` Acid rain ''"]}}
