Unlike the formal military alliance of the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy), the Triple Entente was a diplomatic understanding that aimed to counterbalance the power of the Central Powers.\n\n2. **Franco-Russian Alliance (1894)**: This military pact between France and Russia was established to deter German aggression and was a significant precursor to the Triple Entente. The Franco-Russian Alliance was crucial in creating a two-front scenario for Germany, which was a strategic advantage for both France and Russia.\n\n3. **Role of Great Britain**: Great Britain\u2019s involvement in the Triple Entente was motivated by its concerns over German militarism and naval expansion. The British sought to strengthen ties with France and Russia to ensure a united front against potential aggression from Germany.

The alliance aimed to restrain liberalism and secularism in Europe in the wake of the devastating French Revolutionary Wars, and it nominally succeeded in this until the Crimean War (1853\u20131856). Otto von Bismarck managed to reunite the Holy Alliance after the 1871 unification of Germany, but the alliance again faltered by the 1880s over Austrian and Russian conflicts of interest with regard to the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire.\n", "The Anglo-French Alliance is the name for the alliance between Great Britain and France between 1716 and 1731. It formed part of the stately quadrille in which the Great Powers of Europe repeatedly switched partners to try to build a superior alliance.\n", "In a watershed moment in European diplomacy, Francis came to an understanding with the Ottoman Empire that developed into a Franco-Ottoman alliance. The alliance has been called \"the first nonideological diplomatic alliance of its kind between a Christian and non-Christian empire\". It did, however, cause quite a scandal in the Christian world and was designated \"the impious alliance\", or \"the sacrilegious union of the [French]\u00a0Lily and the [Ottoman]\u00a0Crescent.\" Nevertheless, it endured for many years, since it served the objective interests of both parties. The two powers colluded against Charles V, and in 1543 they even combined for a joint naval assault in the Siege of Nice.\n", "A Franco-Ottoman alliance was established in 1536 between the king of France Francis I and the Turkish ruler of the Ottoman Empire Suleiman the Magnificent following the critical setbacks which Francis had encountered in Europe against Charles V. The alliance has been called \"the first nonideological diplomatic alliance of its kind between a Christian and non-Christian empire\". It caused a scandal in the Christian world, and was designated as \"the impious alliance\", or \"the sacrilegious union of the Lily and the Crescent\"; nevertheless, it endured since it served the objective interests of both parties.\n", "BULLET::::- The Franco-Russian Alliance or Dual Alliance of 1894, between France and Tsarist Russia\n", "The advantage of a Franco-Russian alliance was clear to all Frenchmen: France would not be alone against Germany, for it promised a two-front war. Formal visits were exchanged between the two powers in 1890 and 1891, and the Russian Tsar saluted the French national anthem, La Marseillaise. The Franco-Russian alliance was announced in 1894. This diplomatic coup was followed by a secret agreement with Italy, allowing the Italians a free hand to expand in Tripoli (modern Libya, then still under Turkish rule). In return, Italy promised she would remain non-belligerent against France in any future war. Meanwhile, as Britain became increasingly anxious over the German naval buildup and industrial rivalry, agreement with France became increasingly attractive.\n", "In August 1891, France and Russia signed a \"consultative pact\" where both nations agreed to consult each other if another power were to threaten the peace of Europe. Negotiations were increasingly successful, and in early 1894 France and Russia agreed to the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]], a military pledge to join together in war if Germany attacked either of them. The alliance was intended to deter Germany from going to war by presenting it with the threat of a two-front war; neither France or Russia could hope to defeat Germany on its own, but their combined power might do so. France had finally escaped its diplomatic isolation. The alliance was secret until 1897, when the French government realized that secrecy was defeating its deterrent value. After France was humiliated by Britain in the [[Fashoda Incident]] of 1898, the French wanted the alliance to become an anti-British alliance. In 1900, the alliance was amended to name Great Britain as a threat and stipulated that should Britain attack France, Russia would invade India. The French provided a loan so that the Russians could start the construction of a railroad from Orenburg to [[Tashkent]]. Tashkent in its turn would be the base from which the Russians would invade Afghanistan as the prelude to invading India.\n", "Russia had previously been a member of the League of the Three Emperors, an alliance in 1873 with Austria-Hungary and Germany. The alliance was part of German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck\u2032s plan to isolate France diplomatically; he feared that France's revanchist aspirations might lead it to attempt to regain its 1871 losses stemming from the Franco-Prussian War. The alliance also served to oppose such progressive movements as the First International, which the conservative rulers found unsettling.\n", "A Franco-Persian alliance or Franco-Iranian alliance was formed for a short period between the French Empire of Napoleon I and Fath Ali Shah against Russia and Great Britain between 1807 and 1809. The alliance was part of a plan to gather extra aid against Russia and by Persia's help, having another front on Russia's southern borders, namely the Caucasus region. The alliance unravelled when France finally allied with Russia and turned its focus to European campaigns.\n"], "__answers__": ["The Triple Entente"]}}
