The Scheffer case of 1902 is the first case of the identification, arrest, and conviction of a murderer based upon fingerprint evidence. Alphonse Bertillon identified the thief and murderer Scheffer, who had previously been arrested and his fingerprints filed some months before, from the fingerprints found on a fractured glass showcase, after a theft in a dentist's apartment where the dentist's employee was found dead.

Galton pointed out that there were specific types of fingerprint patterns.

Up until the early 1890s police forces in the United States and on the European continent could not reliably identify criminals to track their criminal record. Francis Galton published a detailed statistical model of fingerprint analysis and identification in his 1892 book \"Finger Prints\".

The reasoning process can be enhanced by integrating additional context and clarifying the timeline of events related to the development and adoption of fingerprinting.\n\n1. **Historical Context**:\n   - Fingerprinting as a method of criminal identification was first introduced by Sir William James Herschel in the 1860s in India. This early use laid the groundwork for future developments in the field.\n   - In 1880, Dr. Henry Faulds proposed the use of fingerprints for forensic purposes, which was a significant step toward formalizing fingerprinting as a method of identification.\n\n2. **Scientific Foundations**:\n   - Francis Galton's work in 1892 established a scientific basis for fingerprint analysis, including a classification system that would later be crucial for police identification processes. His statistical model indicated the uniqueness of fingerprints, which bolstered their use in law enforcement.\n\n3. **First Recorded Use**:\n   - The first recorded use of fingerprints for criminal identification by police occurred in Argentina in 1892 when Juan Vucetich solved a murder case using fingerprint evidence. This event marked a pivotal moment in forensic science, demonstrating the practical application of fingerprinting in solving crimes.\n\n4. **Subsequent Developments**:\n   - Following Vucetich's success, the practice gained traction. In 1901, the London Scotland Yard began systematically using fingerprints for criminal identification, and the establishment of the Metropolitan Police Fingerprint Bureau by Sir Edward Henry further formalized the practice in Britain.\n   - The Paris police also utilized fingerprints to identify a murderer on October 16, 1901, showcasing the growing acceptance of fingerprinting across different jurisdictions.\n\n5. **Impact on Law Enforcement**:\n   - The adoption of fingerprinting by various police forces worldwide illustrates the diffusion of this technology and its significance in modern law enforcement practices. The establishment of fingerprint bureaus and the systematic collection of fingerprint data allowed for more reliable identification of criminals.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy understanding the historical context, scientific foundations, and the timeline of events, we can see how fingerprinting evolved from a novel idea to a standard practice in law enforcement.
