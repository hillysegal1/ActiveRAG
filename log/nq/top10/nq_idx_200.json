Spinal fusion is a common approach to destroying the microorganism causing the disease and rebuilding parts of the spine that were lost due to the infection. Fusions can be approached anteriorly or posteriorly, or both, depending on where the infection is located in the vertebral area. Spinal fusions involve cleaning the infected area of the spine and inserting instrumentation to stabilize the vertebrae and disc(s). Such instrumentation often includes bone grafts harvested from other areas of the body or from a bone bank, where bone fragments are harvested from deceased donors. The new bone graft is secured in the appropriate spinal region through the use of supporting rods and screws, most of which are made from titanium.

This procedure, known as spinal fusion, is performed to alleviate pain, stabilize the spine, or correct deformities. It involves the use of bone grafts\u2014either harvested from the patient, a donor, or synthetic materials\u2014and hardware such as screws and rods to promote healing and ensure stability. Spinal fusion is typically indicated for conditions like degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, or after spinal surgery when non-surgical treatments have failed.

Minimally invasive techniques are also becoming more popular. These techniques use advanced image guidance systems to insert rods/screws into the spine through smaller incisions, allowing for less muscle damage, blood loss, infections, pain, and length of stay in the hospital. The following list gives examples of common types of fusion techniques performed at each level of the spine: \n", "BULLET::::- \"Synostosis\" is where two bones that are initially separated eventually fuse together, essentially becoming one bone. In humans, as in other animals, the plates of the cranium fuse together with dense fibrous connective tissue as a child approaches adulthood. Children whose cranial plates fuse too early may suffer deformities and brain damage as the skull does not expand properly to accommodate the growing brain, a condition known as craniostenosis.\n", "A spinal fracture, also called a vertebral fracture or a broken back, is a fracture affecting the vertebrae of the spinal column. Most types of spinal fracture confer a significant risk of spinal cord injury. After the immediate trauma, there is a risk of spinal cord injury (or worsening of an already injured spine) if the fracture is \"unstable\", that is, likely to change alignment without internal or external fixation.\n", "The frontal suture is a fibrous joint that divides the two halves of the frontal bone of the skull in infants and children. Typically, it completely fuses between three and nine months of age, with the two halves of the frontal bone being fused together. It is also called the metopic suture, although this term may also refer specifically to a \"persistent frontal suture\".\n"], "__answers__": ["joins two or more vertebrae", "a neurosurgical or orthopedic surgical technique that joins two or more vertebrae"]}}
