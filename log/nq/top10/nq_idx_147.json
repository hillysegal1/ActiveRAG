These include:\n   - **Ammonia (NH\u2083)**: The hydrogen atoms in ammonia are bonded to nitrogen, allowing for hydrogen bonding with other ammonia molecules or water.\n   - **Hydrofluoric Acid (HF)**: HF exhibits strong hydrogen bonding due to the high electronegativity of fluorine, making it unique among hydrogen halides.\n   - **Alcohols (e.g., Ethanol, C\u2082H\u2085OH)**: Alcohols contain a hydroxyl (-OH) group, enabling them to form hydrogen bonds with other alcohol molecules or with water.\n   - **Carboxylic Acids (e.g., Acetic Acid, CH\u2083COOH)**: These compounds can form hydrogen bonds due to the presence of both hydroxyl and carbonyl groups.\n   - **Amino Acids**: The functional groups in amino acids (like -NH\u2082 and -COOH) can participate in hydrogen bonding, which is essential for protein structure.\n\n3. **Role of Hydrogen Bonds in Biological Structures**: Hydrogen bonds are critical in biological systems, stabilizing the structure of DNA (contributing to the double helix formation) and influencing the three-dimensional shapes of proteins. This highlights the importance of hydrogen bonding in molecular biology and biochemistry.\n\n4. **Strength and Characteristics of Hydrogen Bonds**: The strength of hydrogen bonds can vary, typically ranging from 0 to 4 kcal/mol, but can be stronger in certain contexts. This variability is influenced by the electrostatic interactions between the involved atoms and the molecular environment.\n\n5. **Anomalous Properties of Water**: Water's ability to form up to four hydrogen bonds per molecule leads to unique thermodynamic, kinetic, and structural properties, such as its high boiling point and the anomalous decrease in density when cooled below 4\u00b0C. These properties are not shared by all hydrogen-bonding substances, making water unique.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The understanding of hydrogen bonds extends beyond their occurrence in water to include a variety of other substances that exhibit similar interactions. Recognizing the role of hydrogen bonds in both chemical and biological contexts allows for a deeper comprehension of molecular interactions and the properties of various substances.\n\n### Answer:\nOther than water, substances that exhibit hydrogen bonding include ammonia (NH\u2083), hydrofluoric acid (HF), alcohols (like ethanol, C\u2082H\u2085OH), carboxylic acids (like acetic acid, CH\u2083COOH), and amino acids.

When more molecules are present, as is the case with liquid water, more bonds are possible because the oxygen of one water molecule has two lone pairs of electrons, each of which can form a hydrogen bond with a hydrogen on another water molecule. This can repeat such that every water molecule is H-bonded with up to four other molecules, as shown in the figure (two through its two lone pairs, and two through its two hydrogen atoms).

This interaction is weaker than covalent bonds but plays a crucial role in the properties of many substances.\n\n2. **Identifying Common Substances**: Besides water (H\u2082O), which is a classic example of hydrogen bonding, we can look for other molecules that contain hydrogen atoms bonded to electronegative atoms.\n\n3. **Examples of Molecules with Hydrogen Bonds**:\n   - **Ammonia (NH\u2083)**: In ammonia, the hydrogen atoms are bonded to nitrogen, which is electronegative enough to form hydrogen bonds with other ammonia molecules or with water.\n   - **Hydrofluoric Acid (HF)**: HF has strong hydrogen bonding due to the high electronegativity of fluorine. It is noted that HF is the only hydrogen halide that forms hydrogen bonds, which is a critical distinction.\n   - **Alcohols (e.g., Ethanol, C\u2082H\u2085OH)**: Alcohols contain an -OH (hydroxyl) group, allowing them to form hydrogen bonds with other alcohol molecules or with water.\n   - **Carboxylic Acids (e.g., Acetic Acid, CH\u2083COOH)**: These compounds can form hydrogen bonds due to the presence of both hydroxyl and carbonyl groups.\n   - **Amino Acids**: The functional groups in amino acids (like -NH\u2082 and -COOH) can participate in hydrogen bonding, which is significant in biological contexts.\n\n4. **Biological Importance of Hydrogen Bonds**: Hydrogen bonding plays a crucial role in biological macromolecules, such as binding DNA into a double helix and shaping the three-dimensional forms of proteins. This highlights the significance of hydrogen bonds in molecular biology.\n\n5. **Strength and Nature of Hydrogen Bonds**: The strength of hydrogen bonds can vary significantly (between 0 - 4 kcal/mol, and sometimes as strong as 40 kcal/mol). Understanding this variability helps in assessing the relative strength of hydrogen bonds in different contexts.\n\n6. **Role of Hydrogen Bonds in Water Properties**: Hydrogen bonds contribute to the unique properties of water, such as its density changes when cooled and its liquid state at room temperature. This context is essential for understanding why water behaves differently from other substances.\n\nBy incorporating these insights, the model can improve its accuracy regarding hydrogen bonding and its implications in various chemical and biological contexts, thereby reducing the likelihood of model illusions and enhancing its factual correctness.\n\n**Answer**: \nOther than water, substances that exhibit hydrogen bonding include ammonia (NH\u2083), hydrofluoric acid (HF), alcohols (such as ethanol, C\u2082H\u2085OH), carboxylic acids (like acetic acid, CH\u2083COOH), and amino acids. Additionally, hydrogen bonding is crucial in biological structures, such as the double helix of DNA and the three-dimensional shapes of proteins."}], "question_info": {"question": "other than water what else has hydrogen bonds", "passages": ["A single water molecule can participate in a maximum of four hydrogen bonds because it can accept two bonds using the lone pairs on oxygen and donate two hydrogen atoms. Other molecules like hydrogen fluoride, ammonia and methanol can also form hydrogen bonds. However, they do not show anomalous thermodynamic, kinetic or structural properties like those observed in water because none of them can form four hydrogen bonds: either they cannot donate or accept hydrogen atoms, or there are steric effects in bulky residues. In water, intermolecular tetrahedral structures form due to the four hydrogen bonds, thereby forming an open structure and a three-dimensional bonding network, resulting in the anomalous decrease in density when cooled below 4\u00a0\u00b0C. This repeated, constantly reorganizing unit defines a three-dimensional network extending throughout the liquid. This view is based upon neutron scattering studies and computer simulations, and it makes sense in the light of the unambiguously tetrahedral arrangement of water molecules in ice structures.\n", "Hydrogen bond\n", "A ubiquitous example of a hydrogen bond is found between water molecules. In a discrete water molecule, there are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Two molecules of water can form a hydrogen bond between them that is to say oxygen-hydrogen bonding; the simplest case, when only two molecules are present, is called the water dimer and is often used as a model system. When more molecules are present, as is the case with liquid water, more bonds are possible because the oxygen of one water molecule has two lone pairs of electrons, each of which can form a hydrogen bond with a hydrogen on another water molecule. This can repeat such that every water molecule is H-bonded with up to four other molecules, as shown in the figure (two through its two lone pairs, and two through its two hydrogen atoms). Hydrogen bonding strongly affects the crystal structure of ice, helping to create an open hexagonal lattice. The density of ice is less than the density of water at the same temperature; thus, the solid phase of water floats on the liquid, unlike most other substances.\n", "Hydrogen is noted for the different ways it forms bonds. It most commonly forms covalent bonds. It can lose its single valence electron in aqueous solution, leaving behind a bare proton with tremendous polarising power. This subsequently attaches itself to the lone electron pair of an oxygen atom in a water molecule, thereby forming the basis of acid-base chemistry. Under certain conditions a hydrogen atom in a molecule can form a second, weaker, bond with an atom or group of atoms in another molecule. Such bonding, \"helps give snowflakes their hexagonal symmetry, binds DNA into a double helix; shapes the three-dimensional forms of proteins; and even raises water\u2019s boiling point high enough to make a decent cup of tea.\"\n", "A molecular hydride may be able to bind to hydrogen molecules acting as a ligand. The complexes are termed non-classical covalent hydrides. These complexes contain more hydrogen than the classical covalent hydrides, but are only stable at very low temperatures. They may be isolated in inert gas matrix, or as a cryogenic gas. Others have only been predicted using computational chemistry.\n", "All halogens form binary compounds with hydrogen known as the hydrogen halides: hydrogen fluoride (HF), hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen bromide (HBr), hydrogen iodide (HI), and hydrogen astatide (HAt). All of these compounds form acids when mixed with water. Hydrogen fluoride is the only hydrogen halide that forms hydrogen bonds. Hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, and hydroastatic acid are all strong acids, but hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid.\n", "Hydrogen has only one valence electron, but it can form bonds with more than one atom. In the bifluoride ion (), for example, it forms a three-center four-electron bond with two fluoride atoms: \n", "Water () is an oxide of hydrogen and the most familiar oxygen compound. Hydrogen atoms are covalently bonded to oxygen in a water molecule but also have an additional attraction (about 23.3\u00a0kJ/mol per hydrogen atom) to an adjacent oxygen atom in a separate molecule. These hydrogen bonds between water molecules hold them approximately 15% closer than what would be expected in a simple liquid with just van der Waals forces.\n", "A hydrogen bond (H-bond), is a specific type of interaction that involves dipole-dipole attraction between a partially positive hydrogen atom and a highly electronegative, partially negative oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, or fluorine atom (not covalently bound to said hydrogen atom). It is not a covalent bond, but instead is classified as a strong non-covalent interaction. It is responsible for why water is a liquid at room temperature and not a gas (given water's low molecular weight). Most commonly, the strength of hydrogen bonds lies between 0 - 4 kcal/mol, but can sometimes be as strong as 40 kcal/mol In solvents such as chloroform or carbontetrachloride one observes e.g. for the interaction between amides additive values of about 5 kJ/mol. According to L. Pauling the strength of a hydrogen bond is essentially determined by the electrostatic charges. Measurements of thousands complexes in chloroform or carbontetrachloride have led to additive free energy increments for all kind of donor-acceptor combinations.\n", "Hydrogen and chlorine were originally used as examples of univalent atoms, because of their nature to form only one single bond. Hydrogen has only one \"valence electron\" and can form only one bond with an atom that has an incomplete outer shell. Chlorine has seven \"valence electrons\" and can form only one bond with an atom that donates a \"valence electron\" to complete chlorine's outer shell. However, chlorine can also have oxidation states from +1 to +7 and can form more than one bond by donating \"valence electrons\".\n"], "__answers__": ["inorganic molecules such as water", "organic molecules like DNA and proteins"]}}
