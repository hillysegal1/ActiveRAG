The British East India Company established its rule in India during the 18th century, leading to various political movements aimed at addressing grievances against British policies.\n\n1. **Historical Context**: \n   - The British Raj began in 1858, but political organizations started forming even before this period. The **Indian Association**, founded in 1876 by Surendranath Banerjee and others in Kolkata (then Calcutta), is often recognized as one of the earliest political societies.

However, it was built upon the foundations laid by earlier organizations like the Indian Association.\n\n3. **Emergence of Radical Nationalism**:\n   - The **Anushilan Samity**, founded by Satish Chandra Basu, represents a shift towards militant nationalism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This society aimed for the violent overthrow of British rule and reflects the growing radical sentiments among Indian nationalists.\n\n4. **Influential Figures and Movements**:\n   - Key figures such as Aurobindo Ghosh contributed to the spread of nationalist ideas and the formation of secret societies, indicating the diverse approaches to political activism during this period.\n\n5. **Contextual Factors**:\n   - The political consciousness in Bengal was significantly influenced by British policies, including the partition of Bengal in 1905, which intensified nationalist sentiments and led to the formation of various political groups.\n\n### Consolidated Understanding:\nThe first political society under British rule in India is often identified as the **Indian Association**, founded in 1876. This organization played a crucial role in mobilizing Indian public opinion and advocating for political rights. Additionally, the **British Indian Association** and the **Indian National Congress** are also significant in the context of early political activism. The emergence of radical groups like the **Anushilan Samity** illustrates the complexity of the political landscape, where both reformist and revolutionary ideologies coexisted.\n\n### Role of This Information:\nUnderstanding the evolution of political organizations during British rule is essential for grasping the broader narrative of India's struggle for independence. The interplay between moderate and radical movements highlights the diverse strategies employed by Indians to challenge colonial rule, enriching our comprehension of the socio-political dynamics of the time.\n\n### Answer:\nThe first political society started under British rule in India was the Indian Association, founded in 1876."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nthe first political society started under british rule in india was\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The first Scientific Society of India was established first in Ghazipur in 1862 by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan for propagating modern Western knowledge of science, technology and industry.

While the **Indian National Congress (INC)** was established in 1885 and is often recognized as a significant political organization, it was not the first. Prior to the INC, the **Indian Association**, founded in 1876 by Surendranath Banerjee and others in Kolkata (then Calcutta), played a crucial role in mobilizing public opinion and advocating for political rights and reforms.\n\n2. **Significance of the Indian Association**: The Indian Association is notable for being one of the first organizations to represent Indian interests and to articulate the grievances of Indians under British rule. It laid the groundwork for future political activism and was instrumental in the formation of the INC, indicating its foundational role in the political landscape of India.\n\n3. **Causal Relationships**: The formation of the Indian Association can be seen as a direct response to the oppressive policies of the British, highlighting a causal relationship between colonial governance and the rise of organized political movements. This reflects a broader trend where political oppression often catalyzes the formation of societies aimed at advocating for rights and reforms.\n\n4. **Influence of Key Figures**: The contributions of leaders like Surendranath Banerjee in establishing the Indian Association demonstrate how individual agency can influence collective political action.

The **Anushilan Samity**, founded in the early 1900s, was involved in militant nationalism and aimed at the violent overthrow of British rule, showcasing the diversity of political activism.\n\nMoreover, the **British India Society**, established in 1839, was involved in lobbying for India's cause in England, indicating that efforts to raise awareness about Indian conditions predated the more organized political movements within India.\n\nConsidering these points, it is clear that while the Indian Association is recognized as one of the first political societies, the British Indian Association and other organizations also played significant roles in the political awakening during British rule.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe first political society started under British rule in India was the Indian Association, founded in 1876.

By 1902, Calcutta had three secret societies working toward the violent overthrow of British rule in India. These included the \"Anushilan Samity\", founded by a Calcutta student named Satish Chandra Basu with the patronage of the Calcutta barrister Pramatha Mitra, another led by a Bengalee lady by the name of Sarala Devi, and a third one founded by Aurobindo Ghosh. Ghosh was one of the strongest proponents of militant nationalism at the time. Having forsaken a potential career in the Indian Civil Service, Ghosh had returned to India and taken up an academic post under the patronage of the Maharaja of Baroda. Here he came to develop a close relationship with Indian Maratha nationalist Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and through him the nationalist network in Maharashtra. Inspired by the histories of Italian and Irish nationalism, Aurobindo began preparing the grounds and network for an Indian nationalist revolution, in which he found support in Tilak. Aurobindo sought for source of military training to prepare for a revolution in future. His younger brother Barin joined Aurobindo in Baroda. Baroda offered Barin to obtain training in military strategies and armed conflicts.In 1903, Aurobindo Ghosh sent his younger brother Barindra Kumar Ghosh to Calcutta to rally the nascent organisation. By 1905, the controversial 1905 partition of Bengal had a widespread political impact: it stimulated radical nationalist sentiments in the \"Bhadralok\" community in Bengal, and helped \"Anushilan\" acquire a support base among of educated, politically conscious and disaffected young in local youth societies throughout Bengal. The works of Aurobindo and his brother Barin Ghosh allowed \"Anushilan Samity\" to spread through Bengal. \"Anushilan\" began a program of slowly building a support base, preparing slowly and steadily for a nationalist uprising, on the lines of the Italian \"Carbonari\".\n", "The British India Society was set up in 1839 in England primarily as a result of the efforts of William Adam, who had come to India and befriended Ram Mohan Roy.

Ghosh was one of the strongest proponents of militant Indian nationalism at the time. By 1905 the work of Aurobindo and his brother, Barin, enabled Anushilan Samity to spread throughout Bengal. Nationalist writings and publications by Aurobindo and Barin, including \"Bande Mataram\" and \"Jugantar\", had a widespread influence on Bengal youth. The 1905 partition of Bengal stimulated radical nationalist sentiments in Bengal's Bhadralok community, helping Anushilan acquire a support base of educated, politically-conscious and disaffected members of local youth societies. Its program emphasized physical training, training its recruits with daggers and \"lathis\" (bamboo staffs used as weapons). The Dhaka branch of Anushilan was led by Pulin Behari Das, and branches spread throughout East Bengal and Assam. More than 500 branches were opened in eastern Bengal and Assam, linked by \"close and detailed organization\" to Pulin's headquarters at Dhaka.
