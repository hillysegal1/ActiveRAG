However, this was limited, as many Irish citizens, particularly Catholics, were still excluded from full political participation.\n\n2. **Act of Union (1801)**:\n   - The Act of Union, enacted in 1801, merged the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. This marked a significant setback for Irish legislative independence, as it effectively dissolved the Irish Parliament and brought Ireland under direct British control.\n\n3. **Rise of Nationalism and the Easter Rising (1916)**:\n   - The early 20th century saw a resurgence of nationalist sentiment, culminating in the Easter Rising of 1916, a pivotal rebellion against British rule. This event galvanized public support for independence and led to increased political activism.\n\n4. **Anglo-Irish War and Treaty**:\n   - The Anglo-Irish War (1919-1921) was a direct result of the growing demand for independence. The conflict concluded with the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December 1921, which established the Irish Free State as a self-governing dominion within the British Commonwealth.

In 1949, Ireland formally became a republic, severing all ties with the British Commonwealth.\n\n7. **Partition of Ireland**:\n   - The Government of Ireland Act 1920 had previously partitioned Ireland, creating Northern Ireland, which remained part of the UK. This partition has had lasting implications for Irish politics and society, contributing to ongoing tensions and conflicts.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe enhanced reasoning process provides a comprehensive overview of Ireland's journey to independence, emphasizing the complexity and multifaceted nature of this historical struggle.

This war involved guerrilla warfare tactics employed by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) against British forces and was marked by significant violence and political maneuvering.\n\n4. **Anglo-Irish Treaty**:\n   - The Anglo-Irish Treaty, signed on December 6, 1921, was a landmark agreement that established the Irish Free State as a self-governing dominion within the British Commonwealth. This treaty represented a compromise, granting Ireland a degree of autonomy while still maintaining some ties to Britain.\n\n5. **Formal Independence**:\n   - The Irish Free State officially came into existence on December 6, 1922. While this marked a significant step towards independence, it was still classified as a dominion, which meant that it did not possess full sovereignty.\n\n6. **Subsequent Developments**:\n   - In 1937, Ireland adopted a new constitution, declaring itself \u00c9ire (Ireland) and further solidifying its independence. The final step towards complete independence occurred in 1949 when Ireland declared itself a republic, severing all ties with the British monarchy and the Commonwealth.\n\n7. **Partition of Ireland**:\n   - It is also important to note that the Anglo-Irish Treaty led to the partition of Ireland, creating Northern Ireland, which remained part of the United Kingdom. This division has had lasting implications for Irish politics and society.\n\n### Answer:\nIreland gained its independence from England on December 6, 1922, with the establishment of the Irish Free State, following the Anglo-Irish Treaty signed on December 6, 1921. This event marked the end of direct British rule over most of Ireland, although the Irish Free State initially held dominion status within the British Commonwealth. Full independence was achieved in 1949 when Ireland declared itself a republic, severing all ties with the British monarchy.

The British government's fear of an independent Ireland siding against them with the French resulted in the decision to unite the two countries. This was brought about by legislation in the parliaments of both kingdoms and came into effect on 1 January 1801. The Irish had been led to believe by the British that their loss of legislative independence would be compensated for with Catholic Emancipation, i.e. by the removal of civil disabilities placed upon Roman Catholics in both Great Britain and Ireland. However, King George III was bitterly opposed to any such Emancipation and succeeded in defeating his government's attempts to introduce it. \n", "In the aftermath of the famine, an increase in industrial production and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms. The population soared in the latter part of this century and the architectural legacy of Georgian Ireland was built. In 1782, Poynings' Law was repealed, giving Ireland legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since 1495. The British government, however, still retained the right to nominate the government of Ireland without the consent of the Irish parliament.\n", "Ireland was in 1939 nominally a Dominion of the British Empire and a member of the Commonwealth. The nation had gained \"de facto\" independence from Britain after the Anglo-Irish War, and the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 declared Ireland to be a 'sovereign, independent, democratic state'. A new constitution was adopted by a plebiscite in 1937. The Statute of Westminster meant that unlike in World War I, Britain's entry into the war no longer automatically included its dominions. Relations between Ireland and Britain had been strained for many years; until 1938 the two states had engaged in the Anglo-Irish Trade War.\n", "BULLET::::- Irish Free State gains independence from the United Kingdom in 1922.\n", "In 1800, as a result of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, the Act of Union merged the kingdom of Great Britain and the kingdom of Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The whole island of Ireland continued to be a part of the United Kingdom until 1922, when what is now the Republic of Ireland won independence as the Irish Free State, a separate Dominion within the Commonwealth. The Irish Free State was renamed \u00c9ire (or \"Ireland\") in 1937, and in 1949 declared itself a republic, left the Commonwealth and severed all ties with the monarchy. Northern Ireland remained within the Union. In 1927, the United Kingdom changed its name to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, while the monarch's style for the next twenty years became \"of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India\".\n", "19th century violent and constitutional campaigns for autonomy or independence culminated in an election in 1918 returning almost 70% of seats to Sinn F\u00e9in, who declared Irish independence from Britain and set up a parliament in Dublin, and declared the independence of Ireland from the United Kingdom. A war of independence followed that ended with the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1922, which partitioned Ireland between the Irish Free State, which gained dominion status within the British Empire, and a devolved administration in Northern Ireland, which remained part of the UK. In 1937, Ireland declared itself fully independent of the United Kingdom.\n", "Irish independence\n", "The War of Independence ended with the Anglo-Irish Treaty, signed on 6 December 1921 and narrowly approved by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann on 7 January 1922. A Provisional Government was set up under the terms of the treaty, but the Irish Republic nominally remained in existence until 6 December 1922, when 26 of the island's 32 counties became a self-governing British Dominion called the Irish Free State. The island had been partitioned by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, and the six counties of Northern Ireland, which had been partitioned artificially so as to create and ensure a unionist majority, exercised their right under the Treaty to opt out of the Free State, and remain in the United Kingdom.\n"], "__answers__": ["In 1922", "1922"]}}
