The instrumentation includes a piano, stadium-sized bass drums, and strings. \"Best Thing I Never Had\" is thematically a kiss-off song; it is in this respect similar to Beyonc\u00e9\\'s own songs \"Irreplaceable\" (2006) and \"If I Were a Boy\" (2008).\\n', '\"Best Thing I Never Had\" is a song recorded by American singer Beyonc\u00e9 for her fourth studio album, \"4\" (2011). It was released by Columbia Records on June\\xa01, 2011, as the third single from the album. \"Best Thing I Never Had\" was composed by Patrick \"J. Que\" Smith, Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds, Symbolyc One, Caleb McCambpell, Antonio Dixon, Beyonc\u00e9, and Shea Taylor.

The main inspiration for the song was the drumming of Doug E. Fresh\\'s song \"The Show\" (1985). Smith told Gyant of Black Entertainment Television (BET) that he was initially intimidated at the prospect of working with Beyonc\u00e9. He was in Los Angeles when Tony Dixon telephoned him to say he and Edmonds were going to write some songs with Beyonc\u00e9.

Rich Juzwiak of \"The Village Voice\" wrote that the song is not as iconic as its reference point \"Irreplaceable\", but \"nor is it as shady\". He commended the optimism in the song\\'s lyrics. \"Consequence of Sound\" writer Chris Coplan commented that the ballad is a powerful moment of self-realization, which is enhanced by Beyonc\u00e9\\'s vocal performance \"as [a] wounded bird turned resilient lioness\". Choosing \"Best Thing I Never Had\" as the highlight of \"4\", Andy Kellman of Allmusic described it as \"a bombastic kiss-off saved by Beyonc\u00e9\\'s ability to plow through it\". Kyle Anderson of \"Entertainment Weekly\" noted the moderate chart performance of \"Run the World (Girls)\", and wrote: \"Best Thing I Never Had\" finds Beyonc\u00e9 mining the same kind of girl-power imagery as she did on \\'Run the World (Girls)\\'. But there is something more direct and honest about the lyrics on the new single (perhaps it\\'s the instant greatness of the line, \\'When I think of the time I almost loved you / You showed your ass and I saw the real you\\'). \\'Best Thing I Never Had\\' feels like the kind of crossover hit that will help \"4\" join the rest of Beyonc\u00e9\\'s discography in multiplatinum land.\\n', '\"Best Thing I Never Had\" peaked at number 16 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and at number four on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

Jon Caramainca of \"The New York Times\" commented that the \"Best Thing I Never Had\" has \"optimistic, coffee-commercial\" pianos, which place Beyonc\u00e9 directly in Lilith Fair territory.
