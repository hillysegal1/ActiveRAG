This concept emphasizes the interplay between human agency and environmental factors.\n\n2. **Contrast with Determinism**:\n   - Possibilism is often contrasted with determinism, which suggests that human actions and societal developments are strictly dictated by environmental conditions. Understanding this contrast is crucial for grasping the significance of possibilism in geography.\n\n3. **Foundational Figure**:\n   - The foundation of the school of possibilism is primarily attributed to Paul Vidal de la Blache, a French geographer. His work emphasized the importance of human agency in shaping landscapes and societies, thereby laying the groundwork for the possibilism framework.\n\n4. **Influence of Historical Context**:\n   - The development of possibilism was influenced by the historical context of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a time when there was a growing recognition of human impact on the environment. This context helps to explain why Vidal de la Blache's ideas gained traction.\n\n5. **Community and Collaboration**:\n   - Just as various educational institutions were founded through collaboration and community involvement, the development of possibilism also reflects a collective intellectual effort. Vidal de la Blache's ideas were part of a broader discourse among geographers and social scientists who were exploring the relationship between humans and their environments.\n\n6. **Evolution of Theoretical Frameworks**:\n   - The evolution of geographical thought, including the transition from determinism to possibilism, illustrates how academic theories adapt over time in response to new insights and societal changes. This evolution can inform our understanding of how theories develop and gain acceptance.\n\n7. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - By examining the relationships between historical context, individual agency, and the development of theoretical frameworks, we can better understand the causal relationships that underpin the establishment of schools of thought like possibilism. Recognizing that a founder's beliefs and the societal context directly influence the acceptance and evolution of ideas enhances our ability to infer outcomes based on initial conditions.\n\n### Answer:\nPaul Vidal de la Blache laid the foundation of the school of possibilism, emphasizing the role of human agency in shaping the environment and contrasting his ideas with determinism.
