The phone itself is thick and weighs . The phone uses an aluminum composite frame. The device is available in three color finishes; \"space gray\" (replacing black with slate trim on the iPhone 5), white with silver trim, and white with gold trim. The iPhone 5S was the first iPhone to be available in a gold color; this decision was influenced by the fact that gold is seen as a popular sign of a luxury product among Chinese customers.\n", "The Retina Display is 1,136 \u00d7 640\u00a0pixels with an aspect ratio of almost exactly 16:9, (minus one extra row of horizontal pixels). With a diagonal of 4\" it has a display size of 6.7 square inches, compared to 5.7 in iPhone 4 and 4s. The pixel density remains the same as the 4s model, which is 326 pixels per inch. Screen icons of the iPhone 5 are arranged in a matrix of six rows of four icons each. The increased screen size allows the sixth row of icons to be added to the five rows that were present in the iPhone 4. In-cell touch sensor technology from Sharp slims the screen which allows for a thinner phone. The screen's color saturation is 44% greater than its predecessor.\n", "The touchscreen on the first five generations is a 9\u00a0cm (3.5\u00a0in) liquid crystal display with scratch-resistant glass, while the one on the iPhone 5 is four inches. The capacitive touchscreen is designed for a bare finger, or multiple fingers for multi-touch sensing. The screens on the first three generations have a resolution of 320\u00d7480 (HVGA) at 163\u00a0ppi; those on the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S have a resolution of 640\u00d7960 at 326\u00a0ppi; the 4-inch models, with 640\u00d71136 at 326\u00a0ppi; the 4.7-inch models, with 750\u00d71334 at 326\u00a0ppi; the 5.5-inch models, with 1080\u00d71920 at 401\u00a0ppi; and the 5.8-inch model X, with 1125\u00d72436 at 458\u00a0ppi. The initial models were using twisted-nematic (TN) LCDs. Starting with iPhone 4, the technology was changed to in-plane switching (IPS) LCDs. The iPhone 5 model's screen results in an aspect ratio of approximately 16:9. The iPhone X is the first iPhone to use an OLED display. It has a near bezel-less screen with a \u224819.5:9 aspect ratio.\n", "IPhone 5S\n", "As of 2015\u201316, there were still a significant number of customers who preferred the 4-inch screen size of iPhone 5S, which remained the second-most popular iPhone after the iPhone 6 and ahead of the iPhone 6S. Apple stated in their event that they sold 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015, even as that form factor was succeeded as the flagship iPhone by the redesigned larger display 4.7/5.5-inch iPhone 6 and 6 Plus back in September 2014. Furthermore, the 5/5S design was regarded as \"long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general\" (with the 5S's gold finish adding a premium touch to the 5's already well-regarded look), while the succeeding 6 and 6S design was less critically acclaimed as it \"felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap\". The iPhone 5 was described as \"elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, iPhone 5 didn\u2019t really look like anything else on the market at the time\". However, the iPhone 5/5S design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6S which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus phablet models. When Apple discontinued the iPhone 5S, it was replaced by the iPhone SE which outwardly appears almost identical to the 5S even as the SE's internal hardware has been upgraded significantly.\n", "The previous major redesign of the iPhone, the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, resulted in larger screen sizes. However, a significant number of customers still preferred the smaller 4-inch screen size of the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 5S.\n", "BULLET::::- iPhone 5s\n", "On September 12, 2012, Apple announced the iPhone 5. It has a 4-inch display, up from its predecessors' 3.5-inch screen. The device comes with the same 326 pixels per inch found in the iPhone 4 and 4S. The iPhone 5 has the SoC A6 processor, the chip is 22% smaller than the iPhone 4S' A5 and is twice as fast, doubling the graphics performance of its predecessor. The device is 18% thinner than the iPhone 4S, measuring , and is 20% lighter at .\n", "From the launch of the original iPhone to the iPhone 4S, iPhones used 3.5-inch displays\u2014which are smaller than screens used by flagship phones from competitors. The iPhone 5 and its immediate successors featured a display that was taller, but the same width as prior models, measuring at 4 inches diagonally. Following Apple's loss in smartphone market share to companies producing phones with larger displays, reports as early as January 2014 suggested that Apple was preparing to launch new iPhone models with larger, 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays. Reports prior to its unveiling also speculated that Apple might use a new iPhone model to introduce a mobile payments platform using near-field communications\u2014a technology that has been incorporated into many Android phones, but has experienced a low adoption rate among users.\n", "iPhone 7 uses the Apple A10 Fusion 64-bit system-on-chip, which consists of two low-power cores and two high-power cores (only two cores are used at any point in time). The A10 chip also features a hexa-core graphics chip capable of \"console-level gaming\". As with prior models, iPhone 7 is available in two sizes: one with a 4.7-inch screen, and a \"Plus\" variant with a 5.5-inch screen. The displays have identical sizes and resolutions to iPhone 6S, but with a wider color gamut and increased brightness. The screen-to-body ratio is about ~66% and ~68% for the 7 and 7 Plus, respectively.\n"], "__answers__": ["4 in", "4 in ( 10 cm )", "4 - inch screen size"]}}
