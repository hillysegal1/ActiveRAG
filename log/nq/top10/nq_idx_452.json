Crowne Plaza is a brand that operates under the InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG), a multinational hotel company that manages several hotel brands, including Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn, and InterContinental.\n\nHowever, the ownership of individual Crowne Plaza properties can vary significantly. The retrieved knowledge highlights several key points regarding ownership changes and brand affiliations:\n\n1. **Ownership Variability**: Ownership of Crowne Plaza hotels can change independently of the brand affiliation. For example, a hotel may be sold to a new owner who retains the Crowne Plaza brand or disassociates from it entirely. This was seen when Massachusetts Mutual Life sold a hotel to EOS DCH Owner LLC, which then disassociated from the Crowne Plaza brand.\n\n2. **Recent Transactions**: The knowledge indicates that various entities have owned or currently own Crowne Plaza properties, such as Hargate Properties and the SEA Group. This illustrates that while IHG owns the Crowne Plaza brand, the actual ownership of specific hotels can belong to different companies or individuals.\n\n3. **Complex Relationships**: The relationship between ownership and brand management is complex. For instance, the unnamed investor who purchased a hotel in March 2012 intended to enter into a management agreement with Crowne Plaza Hotels & Resorts, indicating that ownership and management can be separate.\n\n4. **Causal Relationships**: Financial difficulties, such as receivership, can lead to changes in ownership and brand status. This understanding is crucial for predicting how ownership changes might affect the brand's presence in the market.\n\n5. **Risk Factors**: The mention of mortgage fraud and receivership highlights potential risks in hotel ownership, which can influence decisions regarding brand affiliation and management.\n\nGiven this understanding, we can conclude that while the Crowne Plaza brand is owned by IHG, the ownership of individual Crowne Plaza hotels can vary widely and is subject to change based on financial and operational factors.\n\n### Answer:\nThe owner of the Crowne Plaza brand is InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG).
