Thawne's actions are driven by a complex motivation: he believes that by killing Nora, he can prevent Barry from becoming the Flash. This act is not just a random act of violence; it is a calculated move intended to create a traumatic event in Barry's life, which Thawne believes will alter the timeline and prevent Barry from gaining his powers.\n\n1. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - The Reverse-Flash's intention to kill Barry leads to the unintended consequence of targeting his mother, Nora. This highlights how one character's actions can have far-reaching effects on another's life trajectory.\n   - The emotional trauma inflicted on Barry by the loss of his mother serves as a catalyst for his transformation into the Flash, illustrating how tragedy can motivate individuals to seek justice or power.\n\n2. **Motivations Behind Actions**:\n   - Thawne's desire to manipulate time and prevent Barry's emergence as a hero reveals a deeper layer of villainy. His actions are not merely about killing; they are about altering destiny and controlling the future.\n   - Understanding Thawne's motivations allows for a more nuanced interpretation of his character and the overarching narrative of \"The Flash.\"\n\n3. **Implications of Actions**:\n   - The murder of Nora Allen sets off a chain reaction of events that shape Barry's identity and his quest for justice. This illustrates the concept of a \"butterfly effect,\" where a single event can lead to significant changes in the future.\n   - The emotional fallout from Nora's death affects not only Barry but also other characters in the series, creating a web of relationships influenced by this pivotal moment.\n\n4. **Moral and Ethical Considerations**:\n   - Thawne's actions raise questions about morality and the ethics of time travel. His willingness to kill an innocent person for his own ends highlights the darker aspects of his character and the moral dilemmas faced by heroes and villains alike.\n\nBy enhancing the reasoning process with these insights, we can see how the murder of Nora Allen is not just a plot point but a critical event that shapes the entire narrative of \"The Flash.\" It serves as a foundation for Barry's character development and the ongoing conflict with Thawne.\n\n### Answer\nEobard Thawne (the Reverse-Flash) kills Barry's mom, Nora Allen, as part of a plan to prevent Barry from becoming the Flash.
