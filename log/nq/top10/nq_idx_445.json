This operational history highlights the significance of the electric chair in New York's penal system.\n\n3. **Last Execution**:\n   - The last execution by electric chair occurred on August 15, 1963, when Eddie Lee Mays was executed. This date is crucial as it marks the end of the electric chair's use in New York.\n\n4. **Abolition of Capital Punishment**:\n   - New York state abolished capital punishment in 1965, just two years after the last execution by electric chair. This indicates a significant legal shift away from the death penalty.\n\n5. **Reinstatement and Subsequent Changes**:\n   - Capital punishment was reinstated in 1995, but the method used was lethal injection, not the electric chair.
