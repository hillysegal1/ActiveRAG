Initial attempts at color involved hand-tinting or machine-coloring black-and-white films, with \"Annabelle Serpentine Dance\" (1895) being a notable example of hand-tinting.\n\n2. **Early Color Processes**: The first significant color process was Kinemacolor, introduced in 1908, which allowed for the production of color films but did not gain widespread popularity. The first successful use of subtractive color was seen in \"Cupid Angling\" (1918), marking a step forward in color technology.\n\n3. **Technicolor Breakthrough**: The development of Technicolor in the 1920s was pivotal. By 1932, the introduction of a new three-color camera allowed for a full spectrum of colors, leading to landmark films like \"Flowers and Trees\" (1932), which was the first to utilize this process, and \"Becky Sharp\" (1935), recognized as the first feature-length film shot entirely in Technicolor.\n\n4. **Adoption and Popularization**: The 1930s and 1940s saw a surge in color films, with Technicolor becoming synonymous with high-quality color filmmaking. Iconic films such as \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938) and \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939) showcased Technicolor's capabilities, solidifying its place in Hollywood.\n\n5. **Economic and Cultural Influences**: The Great Depression initially hindered the production of color films, as studios faced financial constraints. However, the post-war era, particularly the 1950s, saw a resurgence in color filmmaking, driven by the rise of television and the need for theaters to attract audiences back. By 1947, only 12% of American films were in color, but this figure rose to over 50% by 1954.\n\n6. **Transition to Dominance**: The introduction of cheaper color processes in the 1950s made color filmmaking more accessible, leading to a dramatic increase in color films. By the mid-1960s, color films became the standard in Hollywood, with black-and-white films becoming rare exceptions.\n\n7. **Legacy and Impact**: The transition to color not only transformed the aesthetic of cinema but also reflected broader cultural shifts in audience preferences and technological advancements. The eventual dominance of color films marked a significant evolution in the film industry, influencing how stories were told and experienced.\n\n### Answer:\nMovies began to come out in color in the early 1900s, with significant advancements occurring in the 1930s, particularly with the introduction of Technicolor. The first feature-length film to utilize the three-color Technicolor process was \"Becky Sharp\" in 1935. By the 1950s, color films became increasingly common, eventually leading to color becoming the standard in Hollywood by the mid-1960s, as black-and-white films declined in popularity.

Hollywood made so much use of Technicolor in 1929 and 1930 that many believed the feature film industry would soon be turning out color films exclusively. By 1931, however, the Great Depression took its toll on the movie industry, which began to cut back on expenses. The production of color films had decreased dramatically by 1932, when Burton Wescott and Joseph A. Ball completed work on a new three-color movie camera. Technicolor could now promise studios a full range of colors, as opposed to the limited red-green spectrum of previous films. The new camera simultaneously exposed three strips of black-and-white film, each of which recorded a different color of the spectrum.

However, it is important to note that Technicolor began developing a full-color process as early as 1924, which was actively utilized in Hollywood by 1929. This indicates that color film technology was being explored and utilized much earlier than commonly acknowledged.\n\n2. **First Successful Color Processes**: While Kinemacolor was introduced in 1908, it was not the first feature-length film to use a color process. The first feature-length motion picture in full color was \"Becky Sharp\" (1935), which utilized the three-color Technicolor process. This detail is crucial for correcting any misconceptions about the timeline of color films.\n\n3. **Advancements in the 1930s**: The 1930s saw significant advancements in color technology, with Technicolor becoming more popular. Notable films such as \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938) and \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939) showcased Technicolor's capabilities, marking a pivotal moment in the transition to color films.\n\n4. **Transition to Color Films**: The transition to color films was gradual. By 1947, only 12% of American films were made in color, but this number rose to over 50% by 1954.

The first feature-length motion picture in full color was \"Becky Sharp\" (1935), which utilized the three-color Technicolor process. By the late 1940s and early 1950s, color films became the standard in Hollywood, with a notable increase from 12% of films being in color in 1947 to over 50% by 1954, driven by the rise of television and the breakup of Technicolor's monopoly."}], "question_info": {"question": "when did movies start coming out in color", "passages": ["Technicolor envisioned a full-color process as early as 1924 and was actively developing such a process by 1929. Hollywood made so much use of Technicolor in 1929 and 1930 that many believed the feature film industry would soon be turning out color films exclusively. By 1931, however, the Great Depression took its toll on the movie industry, which began to cut back on expenses. The production of color films had decreased dramatically by 1932, when Burton Wescott and Joseph A. Ball completed work on a new three-color movie camera. Technicolor could now promise studios a full range of colors, as opposed to the limited red-green spectrum of previous films. The new camera simultaneously exposed three strips of black-and-white film, each of which recorded a different color of the spectrum. The new process would last until the last Technicolor feature film was produced in 1955.\n", "Early movies were not actually color movies since they were shot monochrome and hand-colored or machine-colored afterwards. (Such movies are referred to as \"colored\" and not \"color\".) The earliest such example is the hand-tinted Annabelle Serpentine Dance in 1895 by Edison Manufacturing Company. Machine-based tinting later became popular. Tinting continued until the advent of natural color cinematography in the 1910s. Many black and white movies have been colorized recently using digital tinting. This includes footage shot from both world wars, sporting events and political propaganda.\n", "The real push for color films and the nearly immediate changeover from black-and-white production to nearly all color film were pushed forward by the prevalence of television in the early 1950s. In 1947, only 12 percent of American films were made in color. By 1954, that number rose to over 50 percent. The rise in color films was also aided by the breakup of Technicolor's near monopoly on the medium.\n", "Cinecolor was also prominently employed in processing Paramount's \"Popular Science\" series of short films \u2013 although later prints were made by Consolidated Film Industries under their Magnacolor process. Hal Roach Studios made all four of its features in Cinecolor in 1947\u20131948, becoming the first Hollywood studio to do an all-color schedule. The last American feature released in Cinecolor was Allied Artists' \"Pride of the Blue Grass\" (1954). \n", "In late 1934, Pioneer contracted with Technicolor to make nine features in the full color process, and hired RKO's Merian C. Cooper to be its vice-president in charge of production. \"Becky Sharp\" (1935), an adaptation of Thackeray's novel \"Vanity Fair\", became the first feature-length motion picture in full color, followed by \"Dancing Pirate\" (1936).\n", "By 1932, musicals were declining in popularity, and the studio was forced to cut musical numbers from many productions and advertise them as straight comedies. The public had begun to associate musicals with color, and thus studios began to abandon its use. Warner Bros. had a contract with Technicolor to produce two more pictures in that process. As a result, the first horror films in color were produced and released by the studio: \"Doctor X\" (1932) and \"Mystery of the Wax Museum\" (1933). In the latter part of 1931, Harry Warner rented the Teddington Studios in London, England. The studio focused on making \"quota quickies\" for the domestic British market and Irving Asher was appointed as the studio's head producer. In 1934, Harry officially purchased the Teddington Studios.\n", "The proliferation of television in the early 1950s contributed to a heavy mid-century push for color within the film industry. In 1947, only 12 percent of American films were made in color. By 1954, that number had risen to over 50 percent. The color boom was aided by the breakup of Technicolor's near-monopoly on the medium. The last stand of black-and-white films made by or released through the major Hollywood studios came in the mid-1960s, after which the use of color film for all productions was effectively mandatory and exceptions were only rarely and grudgingly made.\n", "From its birth in the 1880s, movies were predominantly monochrome. Contrary to popular belief, monochrome doesn't always mean black and white; it means a movie shot in a single tone or color. Since the cost of tinted film bases was substantially higher, most movies were produced in black and white monochrome. Even with the advent of early color experiments, the greater expense of color meant films were mostly made in black and white until the 1950s, when cheaper color processes were introduced, and in some years the percentage of films shot on color film surpassed 51%. By the 1960s, color became by far the dominant film stock. In the coming decades, the usage of color film greatly increased while monochrome films became scarce.\n", "One of the first movies to use subtractive color was a silent film titled \"Cupid Angling\" (1918). In 1932, Walt Disney made the first film to use a red, green and blue color process (Technicolor), \"Flowers and Trees\". Three years later, the first feature length movie to be filmed entirely in 3-color Technicolor was \"Becky Sharp\".\n", "In the early 1950s, the proliferation of black-and-white television started seriously depressing North American theater attendance. In an attempt to lure audiences back into theaters, bigger screens were installed, widescreen processes, polarized 3D projection, and stereophonic sound were introduced, and more films were made in color, which soon became the rule rather than the exception. Some important mainstream Hollywood films were still being made in black-and-white as late as the mid-1960s, but they marked the end of an era. Color television receivers had been available in the US since the mid-1950s, but at first, they were very expensive and few broadcasts were in color. During the 1960s, prices gradually came down, color broadcasts became common, and sales boomed. The overwhelming public verdict in favor of color was clear. After the final flurry of black-and-white films had been released in mid-decade, all Hollywood studio productions were filmed in color, with the usual exceptions made only at the insistence of \"star\" filmmakers such as Peter Bogdanovich and Martin Scorsese.\n"], "__answers__": ["introduced around 1940", "1895"]}}
