This made them the first team to win three consecutive titles since the tournament was rebranded from the European Cup to the UEFA Champions League in 1992. This recent success further solidified their reputation as a powerhouse in European football.\n\n3. **Overall Record**:\n   - Real Madrid holds the record for the most Champions League titles overall, having won the competition a total of 14 times (as of 2023). This includes their five consecutive wins in the 1950s and their three consecutive wins in the late 2010s. Their dominance in the tournament is unparalleled, and they have consistently been a formidable opponent.\n\n4. **Contextualizing Achievements**:\n   - Understanding that Real Madrid has both the longest consecutive winning streak (five) and a significant recent streak (three) provides a broader context for their dominance in European football. This context is essential for appreciating the significance of their achievements compared to other clubs, such as Bayern Munich, which previously held the record for consecutive wins in the mid-1970s.\n\n5. **Historical Significance**:\n   - The information about their early dominance (five consecutive wins) versus their recent success (three consecutive wins) illustrates the club's long-standing tradition of excellence in European competitions. This duality of success underscores Real Madrid's status as the most successful club in the history of the tournament and highlights their enduring legacy in European football.\n\n### Summary:\nReal Madrid has won the UEFA Champions League a total of 14 times, with two notable streaks of consecutive victories: five in a row from 1956 to 1960 and three in a row from 2016 to 2018. The five consecutive wins remain the record for the most in the competition's history, while the three consecutive wins mark a significant achievement in the modern era.
