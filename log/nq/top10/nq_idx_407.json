However, construction of the railway actually began earlier, in **June 1875**, at Fort William, Ontario. This indicates that while the company was officially formed in 1881, the groundwork for the railway had already been laid several years prior.\n\n2. **Completion of the Railway**: The CPR was officially completed on **November 7, 1885**, marked by the driving of the Last Spike at Craigellachie, British Columbia. This event is significant as it symbolizes the unification of Canada from coast to coast, fulfilling a key promise made to British Columbia when it joined the Confederation in **1871**.\n\n3. **Historical Context and Impact**: The completion of the CPR not only connected the eastern provinces with British Columbia but also facilitated economic expansion and immigration to western Canada. It became the first transcontinental railway in North America in **1889** after connecting to the Atlantic coast, further solidifying its importance in Canadian history.\n\n4. **Temporal Relationships and Causal Links**: The timeline shows a clear sequence of events: the incorporation of the CPR led to the commencement of construction, which ultimately resulted in its completion. Additionally, the completion of the railway was a condition for British Columbia's entry into the Confederation, illustrating the interdependence of political and infrastructural developments.\n\n5. **Event Significance**: Recognizing the significance of milestones, such as the Last Spike, helps prioritize historical information and understand its broader implications on Canadian society and economy.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy consolidating these insights, we can enhance the model's ability to reason about causality and make logical inferences. The structured timeline and understanding of causal relationships provide a framework for analyzing similar historical contexts and drawing conclusions based on temporal and causal links.\n\n### Answer:\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway started construction in **June 1875** and was officially completed on **November 7, 1885**.
