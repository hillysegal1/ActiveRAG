This indicates that the airship was operating at about half of its maximum passenger capacity.\n\n3. **Causal Relationships**: The model can learn to associate the scheduled flight and the number of passengers with the eventual disaster. Understanding that the Hindenburg was carrying a significant number of people (36 passengers and 61 crew) can help infer the potential consequences of an accident, such as the loss of life and the impact on public perception of air travel.\n\n4. **Quantitative Reasoning**: The distinction between the number of passengers (36) and the maximum capacity (70) allows the model to analyze risk factors associated with passenger transport.
