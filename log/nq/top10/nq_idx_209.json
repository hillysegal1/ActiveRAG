The Organization of African Unity (OAU) established in 1963 solidified these colonial boundaries, deeming any changes illegitimate to prevent inter-state conflicts.\n\n5. **Consequences of Arbitrary Borders**:\n   - The arbitrary borders have contributed to ongoing conflicts and instability in Africa, as they often ignore the complex social fabric of the continent. Scholars like Jeffrey Herbst have noted that these borders have led to both large-scale ethnic divisions and smaller-scale familial separations.\n\n6. **Historical Cartography**:\n   - The evolution of maps and the representation of African territories also played a role in the establishment of borders.

Understanding the historical context of how borders were created is crucial for comprehending contemporary issues related to national identity, ethnic conflict, and governance in Africa.\n\n1. **Historical Context**: Recognizing that the borders were drawn by colonial powers helps explain many of the ongoing conflicts and challenges faced by African nations today. It emphasizes the need for a nuanced understanding of national identity that goes beyond arbitrary political boundaries.\n\n2. **Ethnic and Cultural Considerations**: The disregard for ethnic and cultural affiliations in border creation underscores the importance of inclusive governance and policies that recognize and respect the diverse identities within African states.\n\n3. **Political Implications**: The consensus among African leaders to maintain colonial borders, despite their arbitrary nature, reflects a pragmatic approach to statehood and stability. This has implications for discussions about national sovereignty, self-determination, and the potential for border adjustments in the future.\n\n4. **Cartographic Influence**: The role of cartography in shaping perceptions of territory and power illustrates how maps are not just tools for navigation but also instruments of political control and identity formation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe passages collectively deepen the understanding of how Africa's borders were created and the lasting implications of these colonial decisions. They highlight the need for ongoing dialogue about the nature of statehood, identity, and the potential for conflict resolution in a continent marked by its complex historical legacies.

This conference was a pivotal moment when European powers divided Africa among themselves, disregarding existing ethnic, cultural, and political boundaries.\n\n2. **Arbitrary Nature of Borders**:\n   - The borders drawn by colonial administrators were often arbitrary and did not reflect the continent's demographic, ethnographic, or topographic realities. This has resulted in significant social and political issues, such as the division of ethnic groups and the separation of families from their ancestral lands.\n\n3. **Impact of Colonial Agreements**:\n   - Specific agreements, like the one made between the British and French in 1890 regarding the boundary between French West Africa and Nigeria, illustrate how colonial powers negotiated borders that became entrenched in post-colonial states. These agreements often prioritized colonial interests over the needs and identities of local populations.\n\n4. **Post-Colonial Continuity**:\n   - After gaining independence in the mid-20th century, many African countries retained the borders established during colonial rule. The Organization of African Unity (OAU), founded in 1963, solidified these colonial boundaries by declaring any changes illegitimate, which aimed to prevent inter-state conflicts but also perpetuated historical injustices.\n\n5. **Consequences of Arbitrary Borders**:\n   - The arbitrary nature of these borders has contributed to ongoing conflicts and instability in Africa. Scholars like Jeffrey Herbst have noted that these borders have led to both large-scale ethnic divisions and smaller-scale familial separations, complicating national unity and governance.\n\n6. **Historical Cartography**:\n   - The evolution of maps played a significant role in the establishment of borders. Early maps depicted African kingdoms with vague or imaginary boundaries, while more accurate representations emerged in the 18th century, reflecting colonial interests and the power dynamics of the time.\n\n7. **Modern Implications**:\n   - The legacy of colonial borders continues to affect contemporary Africa, where issues of national identity, ethnic conflict, and governance remain intertwined with the historical context of border creation. Understanding this history is crucial for addressing current challenges and fostering stability in the region.\n\n8. **Ethnic and Cultural Considerations**:\n   - The disregard for ethnic and cultural affiliations in border creation highlights the importance of inclusive governance that respects the diverse identities within African states. This is essential for fostering national cohesion and addressing grievances stemming from colonial legacies.\n\n### Answer:\nThe borders of Africa's countries were primarily created by European colonial powers during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly at the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885. These borders were drawn arbitrarily, often ignoring existing ethnic, cultural, and political realities, which has led to ongoing conflicts and challenges in governance. Despite gaining independence, many African nations retained these colonial borders, a decision solidified by the Organization of African Unity in 1963 to prevent inter-state conflicts.

Scholars like Jeffrey Herbst have noted that these borders do not conform to natural demographic or ethnographic boundaries, which complicates governance and national identity in many African states.\n\n6. The historical context of border creation, including specific agreements such as the one between the British and French regarding the boundary between French West Africa and Nigeria, illustrates how colonial powers negotiated and imposed borders, further emphasizing the arbitrary nature of these divisions.\n\nBy integrating these points into the model's knowledge base, it can better reflect the complexities surrounding the creation of Africa's borders and the historical context that has shaped current geopolitical realities. This enhanced understanding helps alleviate model illusions by providing a more nuanced perspective on the topic.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe borders of Africa's countries were primarily created by European colonial powers during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly at the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885. These borders were drawn arbitrarily, without regard for existing ethnic, cultural, or political boundaries, leading to ongoing tensions and conflicts. After gaining independence, many African nations retained these colonial borders due to a consensus among African leaders, as articulated by the Organization of African Unity, which deemed any changes to these borders illegitimate. This legacy of colonialism continues to impact the political landscape of the continent today."}], "question_info": {"question": "who created the borders of africa's countries", "passages": ["BULLET::::- The Niger-Chad border was created by French military commanders and the Governors-General of French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa.\n", "He argues that states must create new borders, uniting each separate people within one country. In Africa especially, borders were created by European administrators and are not related to the various peoples.\n", "Jeffrey Herbst has written extensively on the impact of state organization in Africa. He notes, because the borders were artificially created, they generally do not conform to \u201ctypical demographic, ethnographic, and topographic boundaries.\u201d Instead, they were manufactured by colonialists to advance their political goals. This led to large scale issues, like the division of ethnic groups; and small scale issues, such as families\u2019 homes being separated from their farms.\n", "During the 1930s and 1940s many intellectuals partook in the theoretical formulation of Afrikaner nationalism. Nicolaas Johannes Diederichs, who later became South Africa's president, formulated Afrikaner nationalistic ideology in his book \"\"Nationalism as a Worldview and Its Relationship to Internationalism\"\" through Kuyperian theology. According to Diederichs, God created nations and these nations had a God-ordained right to exist as separate entities. Therefore, Afrikaners could refuse a \"British-designed\" South Africa in which they would co-exist with other ethnic groups as a minority. Geoffrey Cronje developed these ideas further and argued, that as long as the Afrikaner existed as a minority in a racially and culturally different environment, they could not allow the black majority to develop economically or politically, since this would lead to black domination. He acknowledged this as unjust and unchristian, and as a solution offered total segregation, that is apartheid, between the blacks and the whites.\n", "The book argues that Africa will continue to suffer from wars due to the irrationality of its borders, which were drawn by colonial powers, which do not take into account tribal and ethnic loyalties. According to Friedman, Africa will gradually reshape itself into a continent of stable nations, including a few major powers, and that the best policy is to simply leave Africa alone and provide humanitarian assistance, and allow the continent's borders to be gradually rearranged through warfare.\n", "During the Berlin Conference in 1884-85 Africa was carved up between the European colonial powers, defining boundaries that are largely intact with today's post-colonial states. On 5 August 1890 the British and French concluded an agreement to clarify the boundary between French West Africa and what would become Nigeria. A boundary was agreed along a line from Say on the Niger to Barruwa on Lake Chad, but leaving the Sokoto Caliphate in the British sphere. Parfait-Louis Monteil was given charge of an expedition to discover where this line actually ran. On 9 April 1892 he reached Kukawa on the shore of the lake. Over the next twenty years a large part of the Chad Basin was incorporated by treaty or by force into French West Africa. On 2 June 1909 the Wadai capital of Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9 was occupied by the French. The remainder of the basin was divided by the British in Nigeria who took Kano in 1903, and the Germans in Kameroun. The countries of the basin regained their independence between 1956 and 1962, retaining the colonial administrative boundaries.\n", "In 1985, prompted by economic uncertainties and a rising crime rate, the government of Buhari opened the borders (closed since April 1984) with Benin, Niger, Chad and Cameroon to speed up the expulsion of 700,000 illegal foreigners and illegal migrant workers. Buhari is today known for this crisis; there even is a famine in the east of Niger that have been named \"El Buhari\".\n", "Before 1749, maps of the African continent had African kingdoms drawn with assumed or contrived boundaries, with unknown or unexplored areas having drawings of animals, imaginary physical geographic features, and descriptive texts. In 1748, Jean B. B. d'Anville created the first map of the African continent that had blank spaces to represent the unknown territory. This was revolutionary in cartography and the representation of power associated with map making.\n", "Herbst notes a modern paradox regarding the colonial borders in Africa: while they are arbitrary there is a consensus among African leaders that they must be maintained. Organization of African Unity in 1963 cemented colonial boundaries permanently by proclaiming that any changes made were illegitimate. This, in effect, avoided readdressing the basic injustice of colonial partition, while also reducing the likelihood of inter-state warfare as territorial boundaries were considered immutable by the international community.\n", "The White Fathers then left Ghadames. On 25 March 1890, while the Brussels conference against slavery was being held, Mgr Lavigerie explained in a letter to Keller that to eradicate in Africa the great Muslim corporation of the Senussi, which protected the slave-trade, the Sahara must be crossed, and he announced the opening at Biskra in Algeria, at the entrance to the Sahara, of a so-called House of God, intended for the formation of the \"Brothers of the Sahara\" or \"Pioneers of the Sahara\", who would engage in charitable works and in extending hospitality to travelers, the sick and fugitive slaves. The Pioneers of the Sahara had to live as religious, but without monastic vows. As early as February, 1891, the station at Ouargla, also in northern Algeria, suppressed in 1876, was re-established, and in October Father Harquard sent thither six armed \"pioneers\" who wrote to the cardinal: \"We shall endeavor to hold high the banner of the Sacred Heart and the flag of France.\" The White Sisters founded hospitals at Gharda\u00efa and El Tbiod Sidi Cheikh, thus gaining the confidence of populations which were hostile to France.\n"], "__answers__": ["European imperial powers"]}}
