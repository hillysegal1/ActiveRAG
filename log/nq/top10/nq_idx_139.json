The symphony adheres to the traditional four-movement structure typical of classical symphonies, which allows for a rich exploration of contrasting themes and moods.\n\n1. **First Movement (Allegro)**: This movement is in sonata form, which consists of three main sections: exposition, development, and recapitulation. The first theme is dark and intense, reflecting the G minor key's emotional weight, while the contrasting second theme is presented in B-flat major, providing a sense of relief. The use of sonata form is significant as it allows for thematic development and interaction, which is a hallmark of Mozart's compositional style.\n\n2. **Second Movement (Andante)**: The second movement is structured in a theme and variations form. This lyrical movement contrasts sharply with the intensity of the first, showcasing Mozart's melodic invention and providing a moment of reflection. The theme is often characterized by its graceful lines and expressive qualities, highlighting the emotional range of the symphony.\n\n3. **Third Movement (Menuetto and Trio)**: The third movement follows the traditional minuet and trio form, which was common in classical symphonies.
