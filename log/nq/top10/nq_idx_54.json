For epidemiologists, the key is in the term inference. Correlation, or at least association between two variables, is a necessary but not sufficient criteria for inference that one variable causes the other. Epidemiologists use gathered data and a broad range of biomedical and psychosocial theories in an iterative way to generate or expand theory, to test hypotheses, and to make educated, informed assertions about which relationships are causal, and about exactly how they are causal.\\n', \"Epidemiology studies patterns of health and disease in defined populations of living beings in order to infer causes and effects. An association between an exposure to a putative risk factor and a disease may be suggestive of, but is not equivalent to causality because correlation does not imply causation. Historically, Koch's postulates have been used since the 19th century to decide if a microorganism was the cause of a disease. In the 20th century the Bradford Hill criteria, described in 1965 have been used to assess causality of variables outside microbiology, although even these criteria are not exclusive ways to determine causality.\\n\", 'Informally, in attempting to estimate the causal effect of some variable \"X\" on another \"Y\", an instrument is a third variable \"Z\" which affects \"Y\" only through its effect on\\xa0\"X\". For example, suppose a researcher wishes to estimate the causal effect of smoking on general health. Correlation between health and smoking does not imply that smoking causes poor health because other variables, such as depression, may affect both health and smoking, or because health may affect smoking. It is at best difficult and expensive to conduct controlled experiments on smoking status in the general population. The researcher may attempt to estimate the causal effect of smoking on health from observational data by using the tax rate for tobacco products as an instrument for smoking. The tax rate for tobacco products is a reasonable choice for an instrument because the researcher assumes that it can only be correlated with health through its effect on smoking. If the researcher then finds tobacco taxes and state of health to be correlated, this may be viewed as evidence that smoking causes changes in health.\\n', 'Although health research is often organized by disease categories or organ systems, theoretical development in social epidemiology is typically organized around factors that influence health (i.e., health determinants rather than health outcomes). Many social factors are thought to be relevant for a wide range of health domains. Social epidemiology can therefore address any health outcome, including chronic disease, infectious disease, mental health, and clinical outcomes or disease prognosis. Exposures of interest to social epidemiologists include individual-level measures (e.g., poverty, education, social isolation), contextual factors (e.g., residential segregation or income inequality), and social policies (e.g., policies creating income security or promoting educational access). Analyses that address the independent or synergistic effects of individual or contextual risk factors are often of interest. Understanding the origins of health disparities and identifying strategies to eliminate health disparities is a major focus of social epidemiology.\\n', 'Ecological studies have often found links between risk-modifying factors and health outcomes well in advance of other epidemiological or laboratory approaches.\\n', 'The main context through which this field emerged was the idea of prevalence-dependence, or disinhibition, which suggests that individuals change their behavior as the prevalence of a disease changes. However, economic epidemiology also encompasses other ideas, including the role of externalities, global disease commons and how individuals\u2019 incentives can influence the outcome and cost of health interventions.\\n', 'Although epidemiology is sometimes viewed as a collection of statistical tools used to elucidate the associations of exposures to health outcomes, a deeper understanding of this science is that of discovering \"causal\" relationships.\\n', 'Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and patterns of health-events, health-characteristics and their causes or influences in defined populations.\\n', 'In epidemiology and public health, both standard life tables (used to calculate life expectancy), as well as the Sullivan and multi-state life tables (used to calculate health expectancy), are the most commonly mathematical used devices. The latter includes information on health in addition to mortality. By watching over the life expectancy of any year(s) being studied, epidemiologists can see if diseases are contributing to the overall increase in mortality rates. Epidemiologists are able to help demographers understand the sudden decline of life expectancy by linking it to the health problems that are arising in certain populations.\\n', 'Social epidemiologists research how SES (socio-economic status) determines varying access to resources like income and prestige can generate stratification in health and quality of life. Often, their investigations relate to the social determinants of health which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports as the \"conditions in the places where people live, learn, work, and play ... that affect a wide range of health risks and outcomes\". These epidemiologists must work in conjunction with environmental social scientists to understand the significance of different environments\\' effects on humans. Such work influences environmental and public health policies to better the living standards for humans globally. The Fifth European Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health agreed to work on improving low-income housing conditions with new urban planning, health equity, and environmental justice policies with a specific focus on preventing children from exposure to significant environmental health risks. Certain environments\\' affects on humans provides trends that social epidemiologists can investigate to determine if they are related to a divide of social status especially if only a certain part of the population is negatively affected. Epidemiology uses a host-agent-environment triangle framework to understand why humans are falling ill and this three prong approach allows social epidemiologists to explore how the environment is contributing to the decline in health status for a subsection of or the entire population. It promotes the idea that the social, cultural, economic, political and environmental factors are all important factors to be considered, and health impact assessments (HIA) recommended by social epidemiologists working with environment social scientists are effectively making positive changes in the environment. The World Health Organization (WHO) worked with its members to compose the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) protocol in 2001 to ensure health impact assessments would be made with environmental assessments for policies relating to bettering the quality of life especially within low socioeconomic communities all around the world. As the environment can create stressors that are factors (i.e. low quality housing in areas of high pollution) that limit the quality of life of millions of people globally, environmental social scientists work collaboratively with the data social epidemiologists investigate and provide to understand the relationship between health status and environmental issues. \\n']\n\nTask Description:\nPlease extract content that may be unfamiliar to the model from these passages, \nwhich can provide the model with relevant background and unknown knowledge and concepts, \nhelping it better understand the question. and analyze the role of these contents.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To enhance the model's understanding of the link between health and various variables as explored by epidemiologists, we can extract and analyze several key concepts and terms from the provided passages.

These variables can influence health outcomes through mechanisms like access to resources, lifestyle choices, exposure to risks, and genetic susceptibility.\nTo deepen the language model's understanding of the question through familiarity with basic and advanced pieces of information.\nEncourage the language model to comprehend the question more thoroughly and expand its knowledge boundaries.\nI retrieved some foundational knowledge that is familiar to the model or advanced information beyond the language model's already familiar foundational knowledge from these passages. \nknowledge:\nThe passages provided offer a comprehensive overview of the field of epidemiology, particularly focusing on the relationship between health and various influencing factors. Here\u2019s a consolidation and analysis of the foundational and advanced knowledge presented in the passages:\n\n### Foundational Knowledge\n\n1. **Correlation vs. Causation**: A central theme in epidemiology is the distinction between correlation and causation. Epidemiologists emphasize that while correlation between two variables is necessary for inferring a causal relationship, it is not sufficient. This understanding is crucial for interpreting data accurately and avoiding misleading conclusions.\n\n2. **Epidemiological Methods**: The passages highlight various methodologies used in epidemiology, including observational studies, ecological studies, and the use of instruments to estimate causal effects. For example, using tobacco tax rates as an instrument to study the impact of smoking on health illustrates how researchers can control for confounding variables.\n\n3. **Health Determinants**: The concept of health determinants is fundamental in epidemiology. Factors influencing health can be categorized into individual-level measures (e.g., socio-economic status, education) and contextual factors (e.g., income inequality, residential segregation). Understanding these determinants is essential for addressing health disparities.\n\n4. **Historical Context**: The historical development of epidemiological criteria, such as Koch's postulates and the Bradford Hill criteria, provides a framework for assessing causality in health research. This historical perspective is important for understanding how epidemiological methods have evolved.\n\n### Advanced Knowledge\n\n1. **Social Epidemiology**: This subfield focuses on how social factors affect health outcomes. It examines the interplay between socio-economic status, environmental conditions, and health, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches that include environmental social sciences. This perspective is vital for developing effective public health policies.\n\n2. **Health Impact Assessments (HIA)**: The role of HIAs in evaluating the potential health effects of policies and projects underscores the importance of integrating health considerations into environmental and urban planning. This approach reflects a growing recognition of the social determinants of health and the need for comprehensive strategies to improve health outcomes.\n\n3. **Prevalence-Dependence and Behavioral Change**: The concept of prevalence-dependence suggests that individuals may alter their behavior in response to the prevalence of a disease in their community. This insight is significant for understanding how public health interventions can influence health behaviors and outcomes.\n\n4. **Global Health Context**: The passages touch on the global implications of epidemiological research, particularly in addressing health disparities and environmental health risks. The collaboration between epidemiologists and environmental scientists is crucial for tackling complex health issues that transcend local contexts.\n\n### Role of These Contents\n\nThe information extracted from the passages serves several roles in deepening the understanding of the relationship between health and various variables:\n\n- **Clarifying Concepts**: By distinguishing between correlation and causation, the passages help clarify a fundamental concept in epidemiology that is often misunderstood. This clarity is essential for interpreting research findings accurately.\n\n- **Highlighting Interdisciplinary Approaches**: The emphasis on social determinants and the collaboration with environmental sciences illustrates the need for a holistic approach to public health. This understanding encourages consideration of multiple factors that influence health, rather than viewing health in isolation.\n\n- **Informing Policy Development**: The insights into HIAs and the role of socio-economic factors in health disparities provide a framework for developing informed public health policies. This knowledge is crucial for addressing systemic issues that affect health outcomes in various populations.\n\n- **Encouraging Critical Thinking**: The discussion of historical methods and contemporary approaches encourages critical thinking about the evolution of epidemiological research and its implications for current practices. This perspective fosters a deeper appreciation for the complexities involved in studying health and disease.\n\nIn summary, the passages collectively enhance the understanding of how various factors influence health, the methodologies used to study these relationships, and the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in addressing public health challenges. This comprehensive knowledge base is essential for anyone engaged in epidemiological research or public health policy.\nPlease verify the above reasoning process for errors, \nthen enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to deepen the understanding of the question through familiarity with basic and advanced pieces of information,\ncomprehend the question more thoroughly, and expand the knowledge boundaries.\nAfterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n\nGeneration Format:\nknowledge enhanced inference process:\nAnswer:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Knowledge Enhanced Inference Process:\n\n1. **Identify Key Variables**: Epidemiologists study a variety of variables that can influence health outcomes. These include:\n   - **Socioeconomic Status (SES)**: Factors such as income, education level, and occupation.\n   - **Lifestyle Factors**: Behaviors including diet, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption.\n   - **Environmental Factors**: Conditions such as pollution, access to healthcare, and living conditions.\n   - **Genetic Predispositions**: Family history and genetic factors that may increase susceptibility to certain diseases.\n   - **Behavioral Factors**: Health-seeking behaviors, adherence to medical advice, and preventive health measures.\n\n2. **Understanding the Link**: Each of these variables can impact health in different ways:\n   - **Socioeconomic Status**: Higher SES is often associated with better health outcomes due to greater access to resources, healthcare, and healthier living conditions. This aligns with the concept of health determinants, which emphasizes the role of social and economic factors in health disparities.\n   - **Lifestyle Factors**: Poor diet and lack of physical activity can lead to obesity and related diseases, while smoking and excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of various health issues. This reflects the need for public health interventions that target lifestyle changes.\n   - **Environmental Factors**: Exposure to pollutants or living in areas with limited healthcare access can lead to increased health risks. Understanding these environmental influences is crucial for developing effective health policies, as highlighted in Health Impact Assessments (HIA).\n   - **Genetic Predispositions**: Certain individuals may be more susceptible to specific diseases based on their genetic makeup, which underscores the importance of personalized medicine and targeted interventions.\n   - **Behavioral Factors**: Individuals who engage in preventive health behaviors (like regular check-ups) are likely to have better health outcomes. This ties into the concept of prevalence-dependence, where community health trends can influence individual behaviors.\n\n3. **Epidemiological Studies**: Epidemiologists employ various methodologies, including observational studies, cohort studies, case-control studies, and randomized controlled trials, to gather data on these variables and their relationship to health outcomes. The use of instruments, such as tobacco tax rates, helps control for confounding variables and strengthens causal inferences.\n\n4. **Interdisciplinary Approaches**: The integration of social epidemiology and environmental sciences is essential for understanding the complex interplay between health and various determinants. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of health disparities and informs public health strategies.\n\n5. **Global Health Context**: The implications of epidemiological research extend beyond local contexts, addressing global health disparities and environmental health risks. Collaboration between epidemiologists and environmental scientists is vital for tackling complex health issues that affect populations worldwide.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: By examining these variables, epidemiologists can identify risk factors, understand disease patterns, and ultimately inform public health interventions aimed at improving health outcomes. This comprehensive understanding of health determinants is crucial for developing effective strategies to address health disparities and promote health equity.\n\n### Answer:\nEpidemiologists attempt to explain the link between health and variables such as socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors, environmental conditions, genetic predispositions, and behavioral factors.

For epidemiologists, the key is in the term inference. Correlation, or at least association between two variables, is a necessary but not sufficient criteria for inference that one variable causes the other. Epidemiologists use gathered data and a broad range of biomedical and psychosocial theories in an iterative way to generate or expand theory, to test hypotheses, and to make educated, informed assertions about which relationships are causal, and about exactly how they are causal.\\n', \"Epidemiology studies patterns of health and disease in defined populations of living beings in order to infer causes and effects. An association between an exposure to a putative risk factor and a disease may be suggestive of, but is not equivalent to causality because correlation does not imply causation. Historically, Koch's postulates have been used since the 19th century to decide if a microorganism was the cause of a disease. In the 20th century the Bradford Hill criteria, described in 1965 have been used to assess causality of variables outside microbiology, although even these criteria are not exclusive ways to determine causality.\\n\", 'Informally, in attempting to estimate the causal effect of some variable \"X\" on another \"Y\", an instrument is a third variable \"Z\" which affects \"Y\" only through its effect on\\xa0\"X\". For example, suppose a researcher wishes to estimate the causal effect of smoking on general health. Correlation between health and smoking does not imply that smoking causes poor health because other variables, such as depression, may affect both health and smoking, or because health may affect smoking. It is at best difficult and expensive to conduct controlled experiments on smoking status in the general population. The researcher may attempt to estimate the causal effect of smoking on health from observational data by using the tax rate for tobacco products as an instrument for smoking. The tax rate for tobacco products is a reasonable choice for an instrument because the researcher assumes that it can only be correlated with health through its effect on smoking. If the researcher then finds tobacco taxes and state of health to be correlated, this may be viewed as evidence that smoking causes changes in health.\\n', 'Although health research is often organized by disease categories or organ systems, theoretical development in social epidemiology is typically organized around factors that influence health (i.e., health determinants rather than health outcomes). Many social factors are thought to be relevant for a wide range of health domains. Social epidemiology can therefore address any health outcome, including chronic disease, infectious disease, mental health, and clinical outcomes or disease prognosis. Exposures of interest to social epidemiologists include individual-level measures (e.g., poverty, education, social isolation), contextual factors (e.g., residential segregation or income inequality), and social policies (e.g., policies creating income security or promoting educational access). Analyses that address the independent or synergistic effects of individual or contextual risk factors are often of interest. Understanding the origins of health disparities and identifying strategies to eliminate health disparities is a major focus of social epidemiology.\\n', 'Ecological studies have often found links between risk-modifying factors and health outcomes well in advance of other epidemiological or laboratory approaches.\\n', 'The main context through which this field emerged was the idea of prevalence-dependence, or disinhibition, which suggests that individuals change their behavior as the prevalence of a disease changes. However, economic epidemiology also encompasses other ideas, including the role of externalities, global disease commons and how individuals\u2019 incentives can influence the outcome and cost of health interventions.\\n', 'Although epidemiology is sometimes viewed as a collection of statistical tools used to elucidate the associations of exposures to health outcomes, a deeper understanding of this science is that of discovering \"causal\" relationships.\\n', 'Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and patterns of health-events, health-characteristics and their causes or influences in defined populations.\\n', 'In epidemiology and public health, both standard life tables (used to calculate life expectancy), as well as the Sullivan and multi-state life tables (used to calculate health expectancy), are the most commonly mathematical used devices. The latter includes information on health in addition to mortality. By watching over the life expectancy of any year(s) being studied, epidemiologists can see if diseases are contributing to the overall increase in mortality rates. Epidemiologists are able to help demographers understand the sudden decline of life expectancy by linking it to the health problems that are arising in certain populations.\\n', 'Social epidemiologists research how SES (socio-economic status) determines varying access to resources like income and prestige can generate stratification in health and quality of life. Often, their investigations relate to the social determinants of health which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports as the \"conditions in the places where people live, learn, work, and play ... that affect a wide range of health risks and outcomes\". These epidemiologists must work in conjunction with environmental social scientists to understand the significance of different environments\\' effects on humans. Such work influences environmental and public health policies to better the living standards for humans globally. The Fifth European Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health agreed to work on improving low-income housing conditions with new urban planning, health equity, and environmental justice policies with a specific focus on preventing children from exposure to significant environmental health risks. Certain environments\\' affects on humans provides trends that social epidemiologists can investigate to determine if they are related to a divide of social status especially if only a certain part of the population is negatively affected. Epidemiology uses a host-agent-environment triangle framework to understand why humans are falling ill and this three prong approach allows social epidemiologists to explore how the environment is contributing to the decline in health status for a subsection of or the entire population. It promotes the idea that the social, cultural, economic, political and environmental factors are all important factors to be considered, and health impact assessments (HIA) recommended by social epidemiologists working with environment social scientists are effectively making positive changes in the environment. The World Health Organization (WHO) worked with its members to compose the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) protocol in 2001 to ensure health impact assessments would be made with environmental assessments for policies relating to bettering the quality of life especially within low socioeconomic communities all around the world. As the environment can create stressors that are factors (i.e. low quality housing in areas of high pollution) that limit the quality of life of millions of people globally, environmental social scientists work collaboratively with the data social epidemiologists investigate and provide to understand the relationship between health status and environmental issues. \\n']\n\nTask Description:\nPlease extract content from these passages that can help enhance the model's causal reasoning and logical inference abilities.\nconsolidate these contents, and analyze how the selected information may impact the improvement of the model's causal reasoning and logical inference capabilities.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To enhance the model's causal reasoning and logical inference abilities, we can extract and consolidate key concepts from the provided passages.

They analyze patterns, causes, and effects of health and disease conditions in defined populations.\n\n4. **Correlation vs. Causation**: A critical aspect of epidemiological research is understanding that correlation does not imply causation. While associations between variables may exist, they do not necessarily indicate that one variable causes changes in another. This principle is vital for accurate interpretation of data.\n\n5. **Theoretical Frameworks**: The use of established frameworks, such as Koch's postulates and the Bradford Hill criteria, is essential for assessing causality in health studies. These frameworks guide researchers in determining whether observed associations are likely to be causal.\n\n6. **Social Determinants of Health**: The interplay of social determinants, such as socioeconomic status, education, and environmental factors, significantly influences health outcomes. The model should recognize that health is affected by a complex web of individual and contextual factors.\n\n7. **Instrumental Variables in Causal Inference**: The use of instrumental variables (e.g., tobacco taxes) is an important methodological approach for estimating causal effects in observational studies. This is particularly relevant when controlled experiments are not feasible.\n\n8. **Health Disparities and Policy Implications**: Understanding health disparities and the role of policies in addressing these disparities is crucial. Public health interventions can be informed by recognizing how socio-economic conditions and policies impact health outcomes.\n\n9. **Ecological Studies and Early Links**: The value of ecological studies in identifying early links between risk factors and health outcomes should be acknowledged, as they can provide insights that other methods may not capture.\n\n10. **Health Impact Assessments (HIA)**: The importance of health impact assessments in evaluating the effects of environmental and social policies on health should be integrated into the model's knowledge base.\n\n### Answer:\nEpidemiologists attempt to explain the link between health and variables such as socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors, environmental conditions, genetic predispositions, and behavioral factors. These variables can influence health outcomes through mechanisms like access to resources, lifestyle choices, exposure to risks, and genetic susceptibility. \n\nMoreover, it is crucial to understand that correlation does not imply causation; associations between variables must be carefully analyzed using established frameworks like Koch's postulates and the Bradford Hill criteria. The interplay of social determinants of health significantly affects outcomes, and the use of instrumental variables can help infer causal relationships in observational studies. Additionally, recognizing health disparities and the impact of policies on health is essential for informing public health interventions. \n\nBy incorporating these insights, we can better understand the complexities of health determinants and improve the accuracy of epidemiological research."}], "question_info": {"question": "epidemiologists attempt to explain the link between health and variables such as", "passages": ["\"Correlation does not imply causation\" is a common theme for much of the epidemiological literature. For epidemiologists, the key is in the term inference. Correlation, or at least association between two variables, is a necessary but not sufficient criteria for inference that one variable causes the other. Epidemiologists use gathered data and a broad range of biomedical and psychosocial theories in an iterative way to generate or expand theory, to test hypotheses, and to make educated, informed assertions about which relationships are causal, and about exactly how they are causal.\n", "Epidemiology studies patterns of health and disease in defined populations of living beings in order to infer causes and effects. An association between an exposure to a putative risk factor and a disease may be suggestive of, but is not equivalent to causality because correlation does not imply causation. Historically, Koch's postulates have been used since the 19th century to decide if a microorganism was the cause of a disease. In the 20th century the Bradford Hill criteria, described in 1965 have been used to assess causality of variables outside microbiology, although even these criteria are not exclusive ways to determine causality.\n", "Informally, in attempting to estimate the causal effect of some variable \"X\" on another \"Y\", an instrument is a third variable \"Z\" which affects \"Y\" only through its effect on\u00a0\"X\". For example, suppose a researcher wishes to estimate the causal effect of smoking on general health. Correlation between health and smoking does not imply that smoking causes poor health because other variables, such as depression, may affect both health and smoking, or because health may affect smoking. It is at best difficult and expensive to conduct controlled experiments on smoking status in the general population. The researcher may attempt to estimate the causal effect of smoking on health from observational data by using the tax rate for tobacco products as an instrument for smoking. The tax rate for tobacco products is a reasonable choice for an instrument because the researcher assumes that it can only be correlated with health through its effect on smoking. If the researcher then finds tobacco taxes and state of health to be correlated, this may be viewed as evidence that smoking causes changes in health.\n", "Although health research is often organized by disease categories or organ systems, theoretical development in social epidemiology is typically organized around factors that influence health (i.e., health determinants rather than health outcomes). Many social factors are thought to be relevant for a wide range of health domains. Social epidemiology can therefore address any health outcome, including chronic disease, infectious disease, mental health, and clinical outcomes or disease prognosis. Exposures of interest to social epidemiologists include individual-level measures (e.g., poverty, education, social isolation), contextual factors (e.g., residential segregation or income inequality), and social policies (e.g., policies creating income security or promoting educational access). Analyses that address the independent or synergistic effects of individual or contextual risk factors are often of interest. Understanding the origins of health disparities and identifying strategies to eliminate health disparities is a major focus of social epidemiology.\n", "Ecological studies have often found links between risk-modifying factors and health outcomes well in advance of other epidemiological or laboratory approaches.\n", "The main context through which this field emerged was the idea of prevalence-dependence, or disinhibition, which suggests that individuals change their behavior as the prevalence of a disease changes. However, economic epidemiology also encompasses other ideas, including the role of externalities, global disease commons and how individuals\u2019 incentives can influence the outcome and cost of health interventions.\n", "Although epidemiology is sometimes viewed as a collection of statistical tools used to elucidate the associations of exposures to health outcomes, a deeper understanding of this science is that of discovering \"causal\" relationships.\n", "Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and patterns of health-events, health-characteristics and their causes or influences in defined populations.\n", "In epidemiology and public health, both standard life tables (used to calculate life expectancy), as well as the Sullivan and multi-state life tables (used to calculate health expectancy), are the most commonly mathematical used devices. The latter includes information on health in addition to mortality. By watching over the life expectancy of any year(s) being studied, epidemiologists can see if diseases are contributing to the overall increase in mortality rates. Epidemiologists are able to help demographers understand the sudden decline of life expectancy by linking it to the health problems that are arising in certain populations.\n", "Social epidemiologists research how SES (socio-economic status) determines varying access to resources like income and prestige can generate stratification in health and quality of life. Often, their investigations relate to the social determinants of health which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports as the \"conditions in the places where people live, learn, work, and play ... that affect a wide range of health risks and outcomes\". These epidemiologists must work in conjunction with environmental social scientists to understand the significance of different environments' effects on humans. Such work influences environmental and public health policies to better the living standards for humans globally. The Fifth European Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health agreed to work on improving low-income housing conditions with new urban planning, health equity, and environmental justice policies with a specific focus on preventing children from exposure to significant environmental health risks. Certain environments' affects on humans provides trends that social epidemiologists can investigate to determine if they are related to a divide of social status especially if only a certain part of the population is negatively affected. Epidemiology uses a host-agent-environment triangle framework to understand why humans are falling ill and this three prong approach allows social epidemiologists to explore how the environment is contributing to the decline in health status for a subsection of or the entire population.
