This shift suggested that while the media has effects on consumers\\' behavior such as their voting behavior, these effects are limited and influenced indirectly by interpersonal discussions and the influence of opinion leaders. Selective exposure was considered one necessary function in the early studies of media\\'s limited power over citizens\\' attitudes and behaviors. Political ads deal with selective exposure as well because people are more likely to favor a politician that agrees with their own beliefs. Another significant effect of selective exposure comes from Stroud (2010) who analyzed the relationship between partisan selective exposure and political polarization. Using data from the 2004 National Annenberg Election Survey, analysts found that over time partisan selective exposure leads to polarization. This process is plausible because people can easily create or have access to blogs, websites, chats, and online forums where those with similar views and political ideologies can congregate. Much of the research has also shown that political interaction online tends to be polarized. Further evidence for this polarization in the political blogosphere can be found in the Lawrence et al.

This research underscored the potential of media to shape perceptions and behaviors in specific contexts, further establishing the significance of studying media effects.\n\n4. **Development of the Limited Effects Model (1940s)**:\n   - In the 1940s, Paul Lazarsfeld and his colleagues introduced the \"Limited-Effects\" Model, which posited that while media influences public opinion and behavior, these effects are often indirect and mediated by interpersonal communication and opinion leaders. This model shifted the understanding of media effects from a direct influence to a more nuanced interaction with social dynamics.\n\n5. **Political Campaign Studies and Television's Impact (1944-1950s)**:\n   - Lazarsfeld's studies on political campaigns in 1944 contributed to the understanding of media's role in shaping voting behavior, emphasizing the limited but significant influence of media through the \"two-step flow\" model. The 1950s saw increasing concern over television's effects on children, leading to academic research and Congressional hearings, reflecting societal apprehensions about media content.\n\n6. **Emergence of Selective Exposure and Polarization**:\n   - The concept of selective exposure emerged as a critical factor in understanding media effects, particularly in political contexts. Research indicates that individuals tend to consume media that aligns with their pre-existing beliefs, leading to polarization. This highlights the evolving nature of media effects research, especially in the digital age, where access to diverse viewpoints is both facilitated and restricted by online platforms.\n\nBy synthesizing these elements, we can appreciate the complexity of media effects, recognizing that they are not merely direct influences but are mediated by social interactions, individual choices, and broader cultural contexts. This comprehensive understanding is crucial for cognitive scientists and media scholars, as it informs both theoretical frameworks and practical applications in media literacy and communication strategies.\n\n### Answer:\nThe study of media effects began in the early 20th century, with significant developments occurring in the 1920s and 1930s, particularly through the Payne Fund studies and the introduction of empirical research methodologies."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nwhen did the study of media effects begin\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n[\"Starting in the 1930s, the second phase of media effects studies instituted the importance of empirical research, while introducing the complex nature of media effects due to the idiosyncratic nature of audience individuals.

The first attempt to address these concerns were during Congressional hearings in 1952 that addressed violence. Besides Congress, there were government commissions that also pursued this agenda.

Political ads deal with selective exposure as well because people are more likely to favor a politician that agrees with their own beliefs. Another significant effect of selective exposure comes from Stroud (2010) who analyzed the relationship between partisan selective exposure and political polarization. Using data from the 2004 National Annenberg Election Survey, analysts found that over time partisan selective exposure leads to polarization. This process is plausible because people can easily create or have access to blogs, websites, chats, and online forums where those with similar views and political ideologies can congregate.

This historical development is important for understanding the evolution of media studies as a field.\n\n6. **Selective Exposure**: The concept of **selective exposure** emerged in early research as a way to explain limited media effects, suggesting that individuals are more likely to engage with media that aligns with their pre-existing beliefs. This insight is critical for understanding how media consumption patterns can influence political behavior and public opinion.\n\nBy integrating these points into the reasoning process, we can provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the history of media effects studies.\n\n**Answer**: The study of media effects began in the **1930s**, particularly with the **Payne Fund studies**, which focused on the effects of media on children and adolescents. While earlier theories like the \"Hypodermic Needle Theory\" emerged in the 1920s, the significant empirical research that shaped the field primarily took place in the 1930s and beyond."}], "question_info": {"question": "when did the study of media effects begin", "passages": ["Starting in the 1930s, the second phase of media effects studies instituted the importance of empirical research, while introducing the complex nature of media effects due to the idiosyncratic nature of audience individuals. The Payne Fund studies, conducted in the United States during this period, focused on the effect of media upon young people. Many other separate studies focused on persuasion effects studies, or the possibilities and usage of planned persuasion in film and other media. Hovland et al. (1949) conducted a series of experimental studies to evaluate the effects of using films to indoctrinate American military recruits. Paul Lazarsfeld (1944) and his colleagues' effectiveness studies of democratic election campaigns launched political campaign effect studies.\n", "Media effects studies have undergone several phases, often corresponding to the development of mass media technologies.\n", "In the United Kingdom, media studies developed in the 1960s from the academic study of English, and from literary criticism more broadly. The key date, according to Andrew Crisell, is 1959:\n", "Epitomizing this early school of media effects studies are experiments done by The Experimental Section of the Research Branch of the U.S. War Department's Information and Education Division. In the experiments, the effects of various U.S. wartime propaganda films on soldiers were observed.\n", "The less paradigm in media studies since the Second World War has been associated with the ideas, methods and findings of Paul F. Lazarsfeld and his school: media effect studies. Their studies focused on measurable, short-term behavioral \u2018effects\u2019 of media and concluded that the media played a limited role in influencing public opinion. The \"Limited-Effects\" Model developed by Lazarsfeld and his colleagues from Columbia was highly influential in the development of media studies. The model claims the mass media has \"limited-effects\" on voting patterns. Voters are influenced, rather, through the \u2018two-step flow\u2019 model, the idea that media messages are disseminated through personal interaction with \u2018opinion leaders\u2019.\n", "For a history of the field, see \"History of media studies\".The first Media Studies M.A. program in the U.S. was introduced by John Culkin at The New School in 1975, which has since graduated more than 2,000 students. Culkin was responsible for bringing Marshall McLuhan to Fordham in 1968 and subsequently founded the Center for Understanding Media, which became the New School program.\n", "Concern over the impact that television had on children began when television was still a new entertainment medium. During the 1950s, many individuals, particularly parents, asked their legislators to do something about the potential effects of television viewing on young people. Academic research was initiated since this time to monitor, analyze and explain the relationships between television and children, although the impact of television on academic performance continues to be debated in scholarly research. The first attempt to address these concerns were during Congressional hearings in 1952 that addressed violence. Besides Congress, there were government commissions that also pursued this agenda. Included in these discussions were the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Federal Trade Commission, and advocacy groups formed by concerned citizens. The FCC intended to change a number of policies regarding children's programming.\n", "The social impact of mass communication has been studied at The New School University in New York since its founding in 1919. The first college course to investigate the motion picture was offered here in 1926. Marshall McLuhan's colleague, John Culkin, brought his Center for Understanding Media to The New School in 1975 and The New School began offering the Master of Arts degree in Media Studies, one of the first graduate programs of its kind. Today, among other programs, MA in Media Studies is still being offered by School of Media Studies, The New School, which will celebrate 40th anniversary of Media Studies at The New School during the academic year 2015-2016\n", "History of media studies\n", "In early research, selective exposure originally provided an explanation for limited media effects. The \"limited effects\" model of communication emerged in the 1940s with a shift in the media effects paradigm. This shift suggested that while the media has effects on consumers' behavior such as their voting behavior, these effects are limited and influenced indirectly by interpersonal discussions and the influence of opinion leaders. Selective exposure was considered one necessary function in the early studies of media's limited power over citizens' attitudes and behaviors. Political ads deal with selective exposure as well because people are more likely to favor a politician that agrees with their own beliefs. Another significant effect of selective exposure comes from Stroud (2010) who analyzed the relationship between partisan selective exposure and political polarization. Using data from the 2004 National Annenberg Election Survey, analysts found that over time partisan selective exposure leads to polarization. This process is plausible because people can easily create or have access to blogs, websites, chats, and online forums where those with similar views and political ideologies can congregate. Much of the research has also shown that political interaction online tends to be polarized. Further evidence for this polarization in the political blogosphere can be found in the Lawrence et al. (2010)'s study on blog readership that people tend to read blogs that reinforce rather than challenge their political beliefs. According to Cass Sunstein's book, \"Republic.com\", the presence of selective exposure on the web creates an environment that breeds political polarization and extremism. Due to easy access to social media and other online resources, people are \" likely to hold even stronger views than the ones they started with, and when these views are problematic, they are likely to manifest increasing hatred toward those espousing contrary beliefs.\" This illustrates how selective exposure can influence an individual's political beliefs and subsequently his participation in the political system.\n"], "__answers__": ["1919", "1975"]}}
