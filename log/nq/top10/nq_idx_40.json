Nominations are usually announced in January, a few weeks before the ceremony, which typically occurs in late February. This pattern helps establish a baseline for predicting nomination dates.\n\n2. **Extracted Information**: From the retrieved passages, we have several dates related to Oscar nominations:\n   - September 18, 2018\n   - November 29, 2017\n   - October 10, 2018\n   - October 9, 2018\n   - August 3, 2018\n   - December 5, 2017\n   - October 25, 2016\n   - December 13, 2017\n   - October 5, 2018\n   - September 19, 2017\n\n3. **Key Observations**:\n   - The 2018 Oscar nominations were announced on September 18, 2018, which deviates from the typical January announcement pattern.\n   - The presence of multiple nomination dates in the passages indicates variability in the announcement schedule, which can be influenced by various factors such as changes in Academy policies or event scheduling.\n\n4. **Causal Relationships**: Understanding that nominations precede the awards allows us to infer that the announcement date is crucial for predicting the timing of the awards ceremony.

The language model initially provided the date as January 23, 2018, based on the typical schedule for the Oscars. However, the retrieved passages contain conflicting information regarding the announcement dates.\n\n1. **Passage Analysis**:\n   - **Passage 1** states that the nominations were announced on September 18, 2018.\n   - **Passage 2** indicates nominations were announced on November 29, 2017.\n   - **Passage 3** mentions nominees were announced on November 10, 2018.\n   - **Passage 4** states nominees were announced on October 9, 2018.\n   - **Passage 5** claims nominees were announced on August 3, 2018.\n   - **Passage 9** states nominations were announced on October 5, 2018.\n\n2. **Contradictions**:\n   - The date provided by the model (January 23, 2018) does not match any of the passages.\n   - Passage 1 contradicts the model's answer by stating a later date (September 18, 2018).\n   - Other passages provide additional conflicting dates that do not align with the model's initial response.\n\n3. **Correct Information**:\n   - The most authoritative and relevant information regarding the 2018 Oscar nominations is that they were announced on January 23, 2018. This aligns with the historical data regarding the Oscars, which typically sees nominations announced in January.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The model's initial response was correct regarding the January 23, 2018, date. However, the conflicting passages need to be addressed to clarify that the correct date for the 2018 Oscar nominations is indeed January 23, 2018, and the other dates mentioned in the passages are either incorrect or pertain to different events.\n\n### Answer:\nThe 2018 Oscar nominations were announced on January 23, 2018."}], "question_info": {"question": "when will the 2018 oscar nominations be announced", "passages": ["The nominations were announced on September 18, 2018\n", "The nominations were announced on November 29, 2017.
