Mercedes-Benz Stadium is the more prominent venue, having opened in 2017 and serving as the home for the Atlanta Falcons (NFL) and Atlanta United FC (MLS).\n\n3. **Determine Specific Location**: Mercedes-Benz Stadium is located in downtown Atlanta, a central area that is easily accessible and near other significant landmarks, such as the Georgia State Capitol and the CNN Center.\n\n4. **Consider Other Relevant Stadiums**: Georgia State Stadium, which serves the Georgia State University Panthers, is also located in Atlanta but is distinct from the new stadium referenced in the question. It replaced the Georgia Dome and is part of a broader trend of repurposing sports facilities in the city.\n\n5. **Analyze Causal Relationships**: The transition from the Georgia Dome to Georgia State Stadium and the construction of Mercedes-Benz Stadium illustrates how the relocation of sports teams (e.g., the Braves moving to SunTrust Park) can lead to significant changes in the local sports landscape. This reflects broader trends in urban development and sports economics.\n\n6. **Broader Implications**: Understanding the motivations behind the construction of new stadiums, such as economic revitalization, community engagement, and modern facility needs, enhances the model's ability to infer future developments in similar contexts.\n\n7. **Synthesize Information**: By integrating knowledge about both stadiums and their roles in Atlanta's sports culture, we can conclude that the new football stadium in Atlanta is indeed Mercedes-Benz Stadium, while also acknowledging the significance of Georgia State Stadium in the local sports ecosystem.\n\n### Answer:\nThe new football stadium in Atlanta is Mercedes-Benz Stadium, located in downtown Atlanta. It serves as the home for both the Atlanta Falcons (NFL) and Atlanta United FC (MLS)."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhere is the new football stadium in atlanta\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['Atlanta Falcons stadium\\n', \"On May 7, 2014, Georgia State announced its intentions to purchase Turner Field and the surrounding parking lots after the Atlanta Braves announced that they would move to the new SunTrust Park in Cobb County, west of Atlanta.
