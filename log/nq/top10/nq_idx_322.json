The relevant cities that bid for the event were Annecy (France), Munich (Germany), and Pyeongchang (South Korea).\n\n2. **Bidding Process**: The International Olympic Committee (IOC) received bids from these three cities in October 2009. This establishes the competitive context for the selection of the host city.\n\n3. **Selection Announcement**: On July 6, 2011, the IOC announced that Pyeongchang would host the 2018 Winter Olympics. This decision was based on a voting process where Pyeongchang received 63 votes, significantly more than Munich's 25 votes and Annecy's 7 votes. This quantitative data is crucial for understanding the decision-making process.\n\n4. **Historical Context**: Pyeongchang had previously bid for the Winter Olympics twice before, which indicates persistence and a strong desire to host the games. This historical context can suggest that the city had developed a robust proposal over time, making it a more favorable candidate.\n\n5. **Causal Relationships**: The number of votes received by each city directly influenced the IOC's decision. This causal relationship illustrates how competitive dynamics and the preferences of IOC members led to the selection of Pyeongchang.\n\n6. **Logical Inference**: Given the voting results, it can be logically inferred that Pyeongchang was the preferred choice among the IOC members. The model can deduce that a higher number of votes correlates with a stronger bid and greater support from the committee.\n\n7. **Comparative Analysis**: By comparing the bids, the model can understand the relative strengths and weaknesses of each city's proposal. This comparative analysis enhances the model's ability to evaluate similar situations in the future.\n\n### Answer:\nPyeongchang, South Korea, hosted the 2018 Winter Olympics. The selection was made by the International Olympic Committee on July 6, 2011, after Pyeongchang received 63 votes, significantly more than Munich's 25 votes and Annecy's 7 votes. This outcome reflects Pyeongchang's strong bid and historical persistence in seeking to host the Games."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwho is going to host the 2018 winter olympics\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['Oslo 2022 was a campaign by Oslo and the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports for the right to host the 2022 Winter Olympics.
