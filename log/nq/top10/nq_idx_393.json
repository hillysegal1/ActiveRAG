This would be the only playoff loss in Lombardi's coaching career. Following Lombardi's death in 1970, the league honored his legacy by naming the Super Bowl trophy after him. This renaming, combined with the Eagles inability to win another championship after their 1960 victory, led some Eagles fans to believe the franchise was cursed by Vince Lombardi; that beating Lombardi meant never winning the trophy named after him. During that time, the Eagles accumulated a lot of playoff heartbreak, including 2 Super Bowl losses to the Oakland Raiders and New England Patriots, and 3 consecutive NFC Championship Game losses from 2001-2003. \\n\", 'On January 11, 2009, the team defeated the defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants 23\u201311 en route to their sixth NFC Championship Game.
