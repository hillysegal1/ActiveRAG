This can enhance the model's ability to reason about causality in creative processes.\n\n4. **Genre-Specific Themes**:\n   - Recognizing that certain themes are prevalent in specific genres (e.g., heartbreak in country music) can help the model make logical inferences about the expected content of songs based on their genre.
