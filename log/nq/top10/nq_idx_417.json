The publication of the revised Roman Missal in 1970 marked a formal transition, allowing priests to celebrate Mass entirely in the vernacular.\n\n4. **Continued Use of Latin**:\n   - Despite the shift to vernacular languages, Latin has not been entirely abolished. The official texts of the Roman Missal remain in Latin, and it can still be used in Mass celebrations. The coexistence of the 1962 Missal (the last version before the reforms) and the 1970 Missal illustrates the Church's recognition of both traditional and modern forms of worship.\n\n5. **Cultural and Liturgical Resistance**:\n   - The reforms introduced by Vatican II were met with mixed reactions. Some members of the Church viewed the changes as a departure from tradition, leading to debates about the preservation of the Latin Mass and the introduction of contemporary elements in liturgy. This resistance highlights the cultural dynamics within the Church and the importance of tradition in religious practices.\n\n6. **Ongoing Relevance of Latin**:\n   - The continued use of Latin in certain contexts, such as special liturgies or traditional Masses, underscores its significance in the Church's identity. While vernacular languages have become predominant, Latin retains a place of honor, reflecting the Church's historical roots and liturgical heritage.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe transition from Latin to vernacular languages in the Mass is a complex issue that encompasses historical, theological, and cultural dimensions. Understanding this transition provides insight into the evolution of Catholic liturgy and highlights the ongoing dialogue between tradition and modernity within the Church. The coexistence of Latin and vernacular languages in the liturgy illustrates the Church's efforts to engage with contemporary congregations while honoring its historical practices.\n\n### Answer:\nThe use of Latin in the Mass largely ceased after the Second Vatican Council, with the revised Roman Missal published in 1970 allowing for the celebration of Mass in vernacular languages. While Latin remains an official liturgical language and is still used in some contexts, the general practice in most parishes shifted to local languages following the Council's reforms."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nwhen did they stop saying mass in latin\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n[\"Mass was said in Latin until around 1964, when Vatican II's directives came into effect. \\n\", 'Historically speaking, \"Latin Mass\" can be applied also to the various forms of Pre-Tridentine Mass from about the year 190 of Pope Victor, when the Church in Rome changed from Greek to Latin.\\n', 'Latin Mass\\n', 'Bishops\\' Conferences from all over the world soon voted to expand the use of the vernacular, and requested confirmation of this choice from Rome.

The new Roman Missal published in 1969 allowed for the celebration of Mass in local languages, but Latin has not been completely abolished. It remains an option for Mass celebrations, and the official text of the Roman Missal continues to be in Latin. Thus, while the general practice in most parishes shifted to vernacular languages, Latin is still used in certain contexts within the Church."}], "question_info": {"question": "when did they stop saying mass in latin", "passages": ["Mass was said in Latin until around 1964, when Vatican II's directives came into effect. \n", "Historically speaking, \"Latin Mass\" can be applied also to the various forms of Pre-Tridentine Mass from about the year 190 of Pope Victor, when the Church in Rome changed from Greek to Latin.\n", "Latin Mass\n", "Bishops' Conferences from all over the world soon voted to expand the use of the vernacular, and requested confirmation of this choice from Rome. In response, from 1964 onwards, a series of documents from Rome granted general authorization for steadily greater proportions of the Mass to be said in the vernacular. By the time the revised Missal was published in 1970, priests were no longer obliged to use Latin in any part of the Mass. Today, a very large majority of Masses are celebrated in the language of the people, though Latin is still used either occasionally or, in some places, on a regular basis. The rule on the language to be used is as follows: \"Mass is celebrated either in Latin or in another language, provided that liturgical texts are used which have been approved according to the norm of law. Except in the case of celebrations of the Mass that are scheduled by the ecclesiastical authorities to take place in the language of the people, priests are always and everywhere permitted to celebrate Mass in Latin.\" (\"Redemptionis Sacramentum\", 112)\n", "Text: Latin Mass / Completed: 1978\n", "The Mass of Paul VI was also in Latin but approval was given for the use of vernacular languages. There had been other instructions issued by the Pope in 1964, 1967, 1968, 1969 and 1970 which centered on the reform of all liturgies of the Roman Church. These major reforms were not welcomed by all and in all countries. The sudden apparent \"outlawing\" of the 400-year-old Mass, the last typical edition of which being promulgated only a few years earlier in 1962 by Paul's predecessor, Pope John XXIII, was not always explained well. Further experimentation with the new Mass by liturgists, such as the usage of pop/folk music (as opposed to the Gregorian Chant advocated by Pope Pius X), along with concurrent changes in the order of sanctuaries, was viewed by some as vandalism. In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI clarified that the 1962 Mass of John XXIII and the 1970 Mass of Paul VI are two forms of the same Roman Rite, the first, which had never been \"juridically abrogated\", now being an \"extraordinary form of the Roman Rite\", while the other \"obviously is and continues to be the normal Form \u2013 the Forma ordinaria \u2013 of the Eucharistic Liturgy\".\n", "The term \"Mass\" is derived from the concluding words of the Roman Rite Mass in Latin: \"\"Ite, missa est\"\" (\"Go; it is the dismissal\"). The Late Latin word \"missa\" substantively corresponds to the classical Latin word \"missio\". In antiquity, \"missa\" simply meant \"dismissal\". In Christian usage, however, it gradually took on a deeper meaning. The word \"dismissal\" has come to imply a mission.\n", "Neither the Second Vatican Council nor the subsequent revision of the Roman Missal abolished Latin as the liturgical language of the Roman Rite: the official text of the Roman Missal, on which translations into vernacular languages are to be based, continues to be in Latin, and Latin can still be used in the celebration. The term \"Latin Mass\" is sometimes applied to such celebrations, which in some places are part of the normal Sunday schedule.\n", "In 1965 and 1967 some changes were officially introduced into the Mass of the Roman Rite in the wake of \"Sacrosanctum Concilium\", but no new edition of the Roman Missal had been produced to incorporate them. They were reflected in the provisional vernacular translations produced in various countries when the language of the people began to be used in addition to Latin. References sometimes met in an English-language context to \"the 1965 Missal\" concern these temporary vernacular productions, not the Roman Missal itself. Some countries that had the same language used different translations and varied in the amount of vernacular admitted.\n", "Accordingly, in order to implement a decision of that council, he standardised the Holy Mass by promulgating the 1570 edition of the Roman Missal. Pius V made this Missal mandatory throughout the Latin rite of the Catholic Church, except where a Mass liturgy dating from before 1370 AD was in use. This form of the Mass remained essentially unchanged for 400 years until Pope Paul VI's revision of the Roman Missal in 1969\u201370, after which it has become widely known as the Tridentine Mass; use of the last pre-1969 edition of the Missal, that by Pope John XXIII in 1962, is permitted without limitation for private celebration of the Mass and, since July 2007, is allowed also for public use, as laid down in the motu proprio \"Summorum Pontificum\" of Pope Benedict XVI. Some continue to use even earlier editions, but without authorisation.\n"], "__answers__": ["1967", "from 1967 onwards"]}}
