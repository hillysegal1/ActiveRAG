In the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) sets annual poverty guidelines, which are used to determine eligibility for various federal assistance programs.\n\n3. **Income Measurement**: An individual or family is considered to be under the poverty line when their total income before taxes falls below the established poverty threshold for their specific demographic category (e.g., single individual, family of four).\n\n4. **Consideration of Resources**: The poverty line typically considers cash income and may not account for non-cash benefits (such as food stamps or housing assistance) that can significantly impact a household's overall economic situation. This distinction is crucial, as many individuals just above the poverty line may still face material hardships.\n\n5. **Annual Updates**: The poverty thresholds are updated annually by the U.S. Census Bureau to reflect changes in the cost of living, inflation, and other economic factors. For example, in 2015, the threshold for a single person under 65 was $11,770, while for a family of four, it was $24,250.\n\n6. **Variability by Location and Demographics**: Different countries and regions may have their own definitions and thresholds for the poverty line, leading to variations in who is considered to be living in poverty. Additionally, certain demographics are disproportionately affected by poverty; for instance, 32.1% of individuals under age 18 and 8.9% of those aged 65 or older live below the poverty line.\n\n7. **Long-term Poverty Experiences**: Research indicates that poverty is not a static condition. Many individuals will experience fluctuations in their economic status throughout their lives, with nearly 40% of Americans aged 25-60 encountering at least one year below the official poverty line. This highlights the transient nature of poverty and the importance of understanding its dynamics.\n\n8. **Material Hardship**: There is a recognized gap between the official poverty line and the actual cost of living. Many individuals earning between 100-200% of the poverty line report material hardships similar to those below the poverty line, suggesting that the poverty line may not fully capture the economic realities faced by many individuals and families.\n\n### Answer:\nYou are considered under the poverty line when your total income falls below the established poverty threshold for your household size and location, as defined by government guidelines or organizations. This threshold is updated annually to reflect changes in the cost of living and may vary based on factors such as geographic location and family composition. It's important to note that the poverty line primarily considers cash income and may not account for non-cash benefits, which can significantly influence a household's overall economic situation.

Additionally, a study which analyzed data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) found that nearly 40% of 20-year-olds received food stamps at some point before they turned 65. This indicates that many Americans will dip below the poverty line sometime during adulthood, but will not necessarily remain there for the rest of their life. Furthermore, 44% of individuals who are given transfer benefits (other than Social Security) in one year do not receive them the next. Over 90% of Americans who receive transfers from the government stop receiving them within 10 years, indicating that the population living below the poverty threshold is in flux and does not remain constant.\\n', 'Lacking educational attainment as well as disabilities are among the main causes for the infrequent employment.

While only about 12% of households fall below the poverty threshold at one point in time, the percentage of those who fall below the poverty line at any one point throughout a year is much higher. Working class as well as working poor households may fall below the poverty line if an income earner becomes unemployed.

For instance, a 2017 Urban Institute study found that 61% of non-elderly adults in this income range reported at least one material hardship. This suggests that the official poverty line may not fully capture the economic struggles faced by many individuals and families.\n\n5. **Longitudinal Poverty Experiences**: The passages provide statistics on the likelihood of experiencing poverty over time. For example, \"nearly 40 percent of Americans between the ages of 25 and 60 will experience at least one year below the official poverty line,\" and \"24.9 percent of the U.S. population will encounter five or more years of poverty.\" This information underscores the prevalence of poverty across different demographics and the importance of considering long-term poverty experiences in discussions about economic stability.\n\nBy integrating these insights, the model can better understand the complexities surrounding poverty, the variability of poverty status, and the limitations of the poverty line as a measure of economic well-being.

It is crucial to recognize that this threshold is not static and can vary based on individual circumstances.\n\n2. **Dynamic Nature of Poverty**: Many individuals experience fluctuations in their poverty status throughout their lives. For instance, \"as many as one in three impoverished people were not poor at birth,\" and \"in any given year roughly one out of every five (20%) households falls below the poverty line at some point.\" This indicates that poverty is a fluid condition, and the model should account for the transient nature of poverty rather than viewing it as a fixed state.\n\n3. **Determining the Threshold**: The poverty line can vary significantly based on factors such as geographic location, family size, and the cost of living. In the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) sets the poverty guidelines annually, which are used to determine eligibility for various federal programs. The poverty thresholds are updated annually by the Census Bureau and adjusted for inflation to reflect the cost of living. For example, in 2015, the poverty threshold for a single person under 65 was $11,770, and for a family of four, it was $24,250.\n\n4. **Income Measurement**: To be considered under the poverty line, an individual's or family's total income must fall below the established poverty threshold for their specific demographic (e.g., single individual, family of four). It\u2019s important to note that the poverty line typically considers cash income and may not account for non-cash benefits (like food stamps or housing assistance) that can affect a household's overall economic situation.\n\n5. **Material Hardship Beyond the Poverty Line**: Many individuals earning between 100-200% of the poverty line experience material hardships similar to those below the poverty line. A 2017 Urban Institute study found that 61% of non-elderly adults in this income range reported at least one material hardship. This suggests that the official poverty line may not fully capture the economic struggles faced by many individuals and families.\n\n6. **Longitudinal Poverty Experiences**: Statistics indicate that \"nearly 40 percent of Americans between the ages of 25 and 60 will experience at least one year below the official poverty line,\" and \"24.9 percent of the U.S. population will encounter five or more years of poverty.\" This underscores the prevalence of poverty across different demographics and the importance of considering long-term poverty experiences in discussions about economic stability.\n\n7. **Annual Updates**: The poverty line is updated annually to reflect changes in the cost of living, inflation, and other economic factors. This ensures that the poverty threshold remains relevant to current economic conditions.\n\n8. **Variability by Location**: Different countries and regions may have their own definitions and thresholds for the poverty line, which can lead to variations in who is considered to be living in poverty.\n\nBy integrating these insights, the model can better understand the complexities surrounding poverty, the variability of poverty status, and the limitations of the poverty line as a measure of economic well-being. This will help alleviate model illusions related to the static nature of poverty and the adequacy of the poverty threshold.\n\n**Answer:**\nYou are considered under the poverty line when your total income falls below the established poverty threshold for your household size and location, as defined by government guidelines or organizations. It is important to note that the poverty line is not static; many individuals experience fluctuations in their poverty status throughout their lives. The poverty threshold is updated annually to reflect changes in the cost of living, and it may not fully capture the economic struggles faced by those earning slightly above the threshold, who may still experience material hardships."}], "question_info": {"question": "when are you considered under the poverty line", "passages": ["Living above or below the poverty threshold is not necessarily a position in which an individual remains static. As many as one in three impoverished people were not poor at birth; rather, they descended into poverty over the course of their life. Additionally, a study which analyzed data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) found that nearly 40% of 20-year-olds received food stamps at some point before they turned 65. This indicates that many Americans will dip below the poverty line sometime during adulthood, but will not necessarily remain there for the rest of their life. Furthermore, 44% of individuals who are given transfer benefits (other than Social Security) in one year do not receive them the next. Over 90% of Americans who receive transfers from the government stop receiving them within 10 years, indicating that the population living below the poverty threshold is in flux and does not remain constant.\n", "Lacking educational attainment as well as disabilities are among the main causes for the infrequent employment. Many households rise above or fall below the poverty threshold, depending on the employment status of household members. While only about 12% of households fall below the poverty threshold at one point in time, the percentage of those who fall below the poverty line at any one point throughout a year is much higher. Working class as well as working poor households may fall below the poverty line if an income earner becomes unemployed. In any given year roughly one out of every five (20%) households falls below the poverty line at some point while up to 40% may fall into poverty within the course of a decade.\n", "The 'absolute poverty line' is the threshold below which families or individuals are considered to be lacking the resources to meet the basic needs for healthy living; having insufficient income to provide the food, shelter and clothing needed to preserve health. Poverty among Americans between ages 18\u201364 has fallen only marginally since 1966, from 10.5% then to 10.1% today. Poverty has significantly fallen among Americans under 18 years old from 23% in 1964 down to less than 17%, although it has risen again to 20% in 2009. The most dramatic decrease in poverty was among Americans over 65, which fell from 28.5% in 1966 to 10.1% today.\n", "those 65 and older are living below the poverty line.\n", "If a family's total income before taxes is below the poverty threshold, that family is in poverty, and all members of that family have the same poverty status. The same applies for a single individual. The poverty threshold is used by federal organizations, including the United States Census Bureau, but government aid programs do not have to use the threshold as a standard to determine eligibility.\n", "Most experts and the public agree that the official poverty line in the United States is substantially lower than the actual cost of basic needs. In particular, a 2017 Urban Institute study found that 61% of non-elderly adults earning between 100-200% of the poverty line reported at least one material hardship, not significantly different from those below the poverty line. The cause of the discrepancy is believed to be an outdated model of spending patterns based on actual spending in the year 1955; the number and proportion of material needs has risen substantially since then. However, the Donald Trump administration is publicly floating a policy that would lower the line even further (in some areas) by switching to a consumer price index that is more accurate for low incomes, which would strengthen assistance programs by reducing the number of eligible individuals and make the line itself an even more accurate indicator of poverty.\n", "15.7% of families and 23.5% of the population had income below the poverty line during the 12 months prior to being surveyed. People with incomes below the poverty line include 32.1% of those under age 18 and 8.9% of those age 65 or over.\n", "In United States, the poverty thresholds are updated every year by Census Bureau. The threshold in United States are updated and used for statistical purposes. In 2015, in the United States, the poverty threshold for a single person under 65 was an annual income of US$11,770; the threshold for a family group of four, including two children, was US$24,250. According to the U.S. Census Bureau data released on 13 September 2011, the nation's poverty rate rose to 15.1 percent in 2010.\n", "The poverty threshold in the U.S. is updated each year by the U.S. Census Bureau. The number is adjusted according to inflation to reflect the updated cost of living in particular areas. In 2016 12.7% of Americans were living below the poverty threshold. Poverty thresholds depend on the number of people living in the household.\n", "By 2013, \"nearly 40 percent of Americans between the ages of 25 and 60 will experience at least one year below the official poverty line during that period ($23,492 for a family of four), and 54 percent will spend a year in poverty or near poverty (below 150 percent of the poverty line).\" By 2015, Rank and Hirschl reported that \"24.9 percent of the [U.S.] population will encounter five or more years of poverty, and 11.4 percent will experience five or more years of extreme poverty\".\n"], "__answers__": ["US $11,770"]}}
