The reasoning process begins with identifying the initiator of the construction and then considers the contributions of subsequent rulers.\n\n1. **Initiation of Construction**: \n   - The construction of the Qutub Minar was initiated by **Qutub-ud-din Aibak** around **1192**. He was the founder of the Delhi Sultanate and a general under Muhammad Ghori. His motivation for building the minar was to commemorate the victory of Islam over the last Hindu ruler of Delhi.\n\n2. **Completion of Storeys**:\n   - After Aibak's death, his son-in-law **Iltutmish** continued the work and completed three additional storeys by **1220**. This indicates a direct succession in the project, highlighting the continuity of leadership and vision in the construction.\n\n3. **Subsequent Modifications**:\n   - The Qutub Minar underwent further modifications and repairs over the years. In **1369**, a lightning strike damaged the top storey, which was then replaced and an additional storey added by **Firoz Shah Tughlaq**. This illustrates the ongoing maintenance and adaptation of the monument to preserve its structure.\n\n4. **Historical Context**:\n   - The Qutub Minar is part of the **Qutb complex**, which includes other significant monuments from the Delhi Sultanate, emphasizing its importance as a cultural and architectural landmark. It is named after **Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki**, a revered Sufi saint, which adds a layer of religious significance to the structure.\n\n5. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - The reasoning process identifies causal relationships, such as how Aibak's victory led to the commissioning of the minar, and how subsequent rulers contributed to its completion and preservation. This understanding of causality is crucial for analyzing historical events.\n\n6. **Temporal Reasoning**:\n   - The timeline of events allows for an understanding of how historical actions are interconnected. For example, the lightning strike in 1369 caused Firoz Shah Tughlaq to take action to repair and enhance the structure.\n\n7. **Contextual Relationships**:\n   - Recognizing the Qutub Minar's place within the broader context of the Qutb complex and its naming after a religious figure helps in understanding its cultural significance and the motivations behind its construction.\n\n8. **Complex Event Analysis**:\n   - The model can analyze the complex interplay of historical figures and events, enhancing its ability to reason about the development of the Qutub Minar and its significance in the context of Delhi's history.\n\n### Answer:\nQutub-ud-din Aibak caused the construction of the Qutub Minar in Delhi, beginning around 1192, to commemorate the victory of Islam over the last Hindu ruler.

A foundation stone was laid in 1956. Sculptor Hamidur Rahman created the design of Shaheed Minar under which construction was started in 1957.

The enormous design included a half-circular column to symbolise the mother with her fallen sons standing on the monument's central dais. Yellow and deep blue pieces of stained glass, symbolising eyes reflecting the sun, were also to be placed in the columns. The marble floor was designed to reflect the moving shadows of the columns.

Two footmarks coloured red and black, indicating the two opposite forces, were also in the design. Besides this a museum and a library were also included in Hamidur Rahman's design.
