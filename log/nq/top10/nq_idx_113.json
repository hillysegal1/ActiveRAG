The quarterback position is pivotal in American football, often determining a team's success. The Packers have had legendary quarterbacks in their history, such as Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers, who have significantly influenced the team's performance and legacy.\n\n1. **Current Roster Evaluation**: As of October 2023, I need to identify who is currently listed as the starting quarterback. This requires checking for any recent updates or changes in the roster, particularly focusing on the quarterback position.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: Understanding the Packers' history, including their founding in 1919 and their success in winning 12 professional championships, provides insight into the team's culture and expectations for the quarterback role.
