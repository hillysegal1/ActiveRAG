The story actually involves Icarus, who is the son of Daedalus, a skilled craftsman and inventor. Daedalus created wings made of feathers and wax for himself and Icarus to escape from Crete. \n\n1. **Understanding the Characters**:\n   - Icarus is not a god but a mortal, specifically the son of Daedalus. The myth emphasizes human traits such as ambition and recklessness, which lead to his downfall. This distinction is crucial because it highlights the moral lesson inherent in the story.\n\n2. **Role of Helios**:\n   - The sun in this myth is personified by Helios, the Greek sun god. While Icarus is the one who flies too close to the sun, Helios represents the celestial body that Icarus approaches. This connection is significant as it illustrates the dangers of hubris and the consequences of overreaching one's limits.\n\n3. **Cultural and Ethical Context**:\n   - The myth serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of hubris, a common theme in Greek mythology. The extracted knowledge about the cultural significance of Helios and the ethical dimensions associated with celestial bodies enriches the understanding of Icarus's actions. The sun is not just a physical entity but also a symbol of divine power and moral authority.\n\n4. **Philosophical Implications**:\n   - The references to Neoplatonism and the philosophical interpretations of Helios as a symbol of divine perfection suggest that the story of Icarus can also be viewed through a philosophical lens. It raises questions about the pursuit of knowledge, the nature of ambition, and the importance of humility in the face of divine forces.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - By integrating the knowledge about Helios, the ethical implications of the myth, and the philosophical dimensions, we can better appreciate the complexity of the story. It is not merely about a character flying too close to the sun; it is a rich narrative that explores human ambition, the relationship between mortals and the divine, and the consequences of defying natural limits.\n\n### Answer:\nIcarus (son of Daedalus, who is a skilled craftsman often associated with divine qualities) flew too close to the sun in Greek mythology.

The myth illustrates the consequences of hubris and disobedience.\n\n1. **Icarus and Daedalus**: Icarus's story is pivotal in understanding the themes of ambition and the limits of human capability. Daedalus crafted wings from feathers and wax for himself and Icarus to escape from Crete. The warning to avoid flying too high (close to the sun) and too low (close to the sea) serves as a metaphor for balance in life and the dangers of overreaching.\n\n2. **Helios and the Sun**: The sun god Helios is significant in this context, as he represents the very force that Icarus defies. Helios is often depicted driving his chariot across the sky, symbolizing the power and constancy of the sun. The melting of Icarus's wings when he flies too close to Helios serves as a direct consequence of ignoring divine boundaries.\n\n3. **Mythological Context**: The broader Greek pantheon, including gods like Zeus and Hades, provides a backdrop for understanding the moral lessons in myths.

This understanding enhances the appreciation of the myth's relevance in discussions about human endeavor and the pursuit of knowledge.\n\n**Answer:**\nIcarus (son of Daedalus, who is a skilled craftsman often associated with divine qualities)."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nwhich greek god flew too close to the sun\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n[\"After the Hyborian Age, the ancient Greek civilization began to rise, so Zeus made the Olympian gods known to them to gain their worship.

Upon analysis, it is important to clarify that the character who flew too close to the sun is not a Greek god but rather a mortal named Icarus. Icarus is the son of Daedalus, a skilled craftsman and inventor, who is sometimes associated with divine qualities due to his exceptional abilities.\n\n1. **Identifying Key Characters**: The myth centers around Icarus and Daedalus. Daedalus created wings made of feathers and wax for both himself and Icarus to escape from Crete. This highlights the theme of human ingenuity and the consequences of overambition.\n\n2. **Understanding the Myth**: Icarus, in his excitement and disregard for his father's warnings, flew too close to the sun. The heat melted the wax in his wings, leading to his tragic fall into the sea. This story serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of hubris and the importance of heeding wise counsel.\n\n3. **Role of Helios**: While Helios, the sun god, is a significant figure in Greek mythology, he is not the one who flew too close to the sun. Instead, he represents the celestial body that Icarus attempted to approach. This distinction is crucial for understanding the narrative and its implications.\n\n4. **Causal Relationships**: The story illustrates a clear causal relationship: Icarus's decision to ignore his father's advice (action) leads to his downfall (consequence). This understanding enhances the model's ability to infer outcomes based on given premises.\n\n5. **Symbolic Interpretation**: The myth of Icarus can be interpreted symbolically, representing the human condition and the struggle between ambition and caution. Recognizing these symbolic meanings can improve the model's ability to analyze narratives and draw logical conclusions.\n\n6. **Cultural Context**: The evolution of the myth and its interpretations over time reflect broader cultural themes in ancient Greece, such as the tension between human ambition and divine limitations.

His trial was a forerunner of the culturally traumatic trial of Socrates for irreligion, in 399\u00a0BC.\n", "In late antiquity mysticism, the sun god Helios is sometimes equated to the Judeo-Christian God.\n", "Apomyius (), Greek for \"driving away the flies,\" was an epithet of Zeus at Olympia. On one occasion, when Heracles was offering a sacrifice to Zeus at Olympia, he was annoyed by hosts of flies, and in order to get rid of them, he offered a sacrifice to Zeus Apomyius, whereupon the flies withdrew across the river Alpheius. From that time the Eleans sacrificed to Zeus under this name.\n", "during classical antiquity it was closer to Kochab (\u03b2 UMi) than to Polaris. It was about the same angular distance from \u03b2 UMi as to \u03b1 UMi by the end of late antiquity. The Greek navigator Pytheas in ca. 320 BC described the celestial pole as devoid of stars. However, as one of the brighter stars close to the celestial pole, Polaris was used for navigation at least from late antiquity, and described as \u1f00\u03b5\u03af \u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c2 (\"aei phan\u0113s\") \"always visible\" by Stobaeus (5th century), and it could reasonably be described as \"stella polaris\" from about the High Middle Ages. In Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, written around 1599, Caesar describes himself as being \"as constant as the northern star\", though in Caesar's time there was no constant northern star.\n", "The Emperor Julian (332-363) embraced Neoplatonic philosophy and worked to replace Christianity with a version of Neoplatonic paganism. Because of his untimely death and the hold mainstream Christianity had over the empire at the time, this was ultimately unsuccessful, but he did produce several works of philosophy and theology, including a popular hymn to the sun. In his theology, Helios, the sun, was the ideal example of the perfection of the gods and light, a symbol of divine emanation. He also held the mother goddess Cybele in high esteem.\n", "In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Zagreus () was sometimes identified with a god worshipped by the followers of Orphism, the \u201cfirst Dionysus\u201d, a son of Zeus and Persephone, who was dismembered by the Titans and reborn. However, in the earliest mention of Zagreus, he is paired with Gaia (Earth) and called the \u201chighest\u201d god [of the underworld?] and Aeschylus links Zagreus with Hades, possibly as Hades' son, or Hades himself. Noting \"Hades' identity as Zeus' \"katachthonios\" alter ego\", Timothy Gantz thought it \"likely\" that Zagreus, originally, perhaps the son of Hades and Persephone, later merged with the Orphic Dionysus, the son of Zeus and Persephone.\n", "The gods are described by Jupiter as residents of the \"shiny, / starry Pole and bright Seat\" (\"\"luzente, estel\u00edfero P\u00f3lo e claro Assento\"\"); this shiny, starry Pole and bright Seat or Olympus had already been described before as \"luminous\"; the Gods walk on the \"beautiful crystalline sky\" (\"\"cristalino c\u00e9u fermoso\"\"), to the Milky Way. In strophes 22 and 23 they are also said to be shining. Jupiter is described as the \"Father\" (\"\"Padre\"\" \u2013 archaic Portuguese for 'father') who \"vibrates the fierce rays of Vulcan\" (\"\"vibra os feros raios de Vulcano\"\") and presides from a \"crystalline seat of stars\" (\"\"assento de estrelas cristalino\"\"), carrying \"a gleaming crown and sceptre / of another rock clearer than diamond\" (\"\"hua coroa e ceptro rutilante / de outra pedra mais clara que diamante\"\"). Jupiter's chair is a crystalline seat of stars and the rest of the Olympian furniture is equally ornate: \"In shiny seats, enamelled / of gold and pearls, under there were / the other gods (...)\" (\"\"Em luzentes assentos, marchetados / de ouro e perlas, mais abaixo estavam / os outros Deuses (...)\"\").\n"], "__answers__": ["Icarus"]}}
