While this song is indeed famous for its social commentary and contains similar themes, it does not contain the exact lyrics in question.\n\nTo enhance the reasoning process, we can incorporate the retrieved knowledge about songs that include \"stop\" and \"listen\" in their titles. \n\n1. **\"Stop, Look, Listen (To Your Heart)\"** by the Stylistics is a well-known soul song that was written by Thom Bell and Linda Creed. This song is relevant because it contains the phrase \"stop\" and \"listen,\" which aligns with the inquiry.\n\n2. **\"Stop, Look, Listen\" by MC Lyte** and **\"Stop, Look and Listen\" by Donna Summer** are additional songs that may not directly answer the question but illustrate the prevalence of similar phrases in song titles.\n\n3. The phrase \"what's that sound\" is often associated with themes of awareness and social commentary, which could lead to confusion with \"For What It's Worth,\" but it is essential to clarify that the specific lyrics do not appear in that song.\n\n4. The context of the inquiry suggests a need to identify songs that directly match the phrasing rather than thematic similarities. \n\nGiven this enhanced understanding, the most relevant song that includes the phrase \"stop, listen\" is \"Stop, Look, Listen (To Your Heart)\" by the Stylistics, which aligns more closely with the inquiry than the previously mentioned song.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe song that includes the lyrics \"stop, listen, what's that sound\" is not directly identifiable from the retrieved knowledge.
