The number of dominoes needed can depend on the number of players and the specific rules being followed.\n\n2. **Standard Set**: A standard double-12 set contains 91 dominoes (from 0-0 to 12-12), while a double-9 set contains 55 dominoes (from 0-0 to 9-9). The choice of set affects how many dominoes are used in the game.\n\n3. **Players and Distribution**: In Mexican Train, each player typically draws a certain number of dominoes at the beginning of the game. The common rule is that each player draws 15 dominoes when using a double-12 set and 10 dominoes when using a double-9 set.\n\n4. **Calculating Total Dominoes**: \n   - For a double-12 set with 4 players: 4 players x 15 dominoes = 60 dominoes drawn.
