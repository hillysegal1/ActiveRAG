This historical context is important for understanding the significance of their transition.\n\n2. **Ownership Change**: The sale of the Astros from Drayton McLane to Jim Crane was a pivotal moment that influenced the decision to move leagues. Ownership changes often lead to strategic shifts in organizations, which is a critical factor in understanding causality.\n\n3. **Realignment Decision**: In 2013, Major League Baseball (MLB) underwent a realignment that included the Astros moving to the American League (AL). This decision was not made in isolation; it was part of a broader strategy to balance the number of teams in each league, which resulted in both leagues having 15 teams.\n\n4. **Effective Date of Transition**: The Astros' official transition to the American League took effect at the start of the 2013 season. This establishes a clear timeline for the move.\n\n5. **Impact on League Structure**: The transition was part of a larger restructuring of MLB, which included the creation of six divisions of five teams each. This restructuring aimed to enhance competition and fan engagement through more interleague play.\n\n6. **Interleague Play Expansion**: The move to the AL was aligned with MLB's desire for expanded interleague play, allowing for more frequent matchups between teams from different leagues. This change not only affected the Astros but also had implications for the scheduling and dynamics of the league as a whole.\n\n7. **Causal Relationships**: The information illustrates a clear causal relationship between the ownership change, the decision to move leagues, and the subsequent restructuring of MLB. Understanding these relationships enhances the model's ability to reason about how one event can lead to another.\n\n8. **Temporal Sequencing and Contextual Inference**: Establishing a timeline (last season in NL was 2012, effective move in 2013) helps the model grasp the concept of temporal causality. Additionally, understanding the broader context of league restructuring aids in making inferences about the implications of the Astros' move.\n\n### Answer:\nThe Houston Astros changed from the National League to the American League in 2013, following their last season in the NL in 2012.
