However, their position was precarious, and they were soon surrounded by local militia and federal troops.\n\n3. **Colonel Robert E. Lee's Role**: The U.S. Marines, commanded by Colonel Robert E. Lee, were dispatched to suppress the raid. Lee's leadership was instrumental in the military response, as he organized the assault to retake the arsenal and capture Brown and his men.\n\n4. **Outcome and Consequences**: The raid ended with Brown's capture, and he was later tried and executed for treason. The event heightened tensions between the North and South, contributing to the growing divide that would lead to the Civil War. Brown's actions and subsequent martyrdom galvanized the abolitionist movement, making him a symbol of resistance against slavery.\n\n5. **Historical Significance**: Understanding the Harper's Ferry raid is crucial for grasping the complexities of pre-Civil War America. It illustrates the lengths to which abolitionists were willing to go and the fierce opposition they faced, as well as the role of military leaders like Lee in shaping the conflict.\n\nBy synthesizing this foundational knowledge, we can see the interconnectedness of individual actions, military leadership, and broader historical movements. This context enriches our understanding of the question and highlights the significance of the raid in American history.\n\n**Answer:**\nColonel Robert E.

Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsay of the Dover Command was to be responsible for operations to confront a German squadron sailing up the Channel with continuous co-ordinated attacks by Coastal Command, the Navy and RAF. The British coastal radar had a range of about and with the five standing air patrols, the planners expected a dash up the Channel easily to be discovered, even at night or in bad weather. As soon as the alarm was raised, the offensive provisions of Fuller would begin as a combined operation. The of the Dover and Ramsgate flotillas, with a Motor Gun Boat (MGB) escort, would make torpedo attacks from . The boats would be followed up by Swordfish torpedo-bombers with fighter escorts and Beaufort torpedo-bombers and the coastal guns at Dover would fire for as long as the ships were in range; Bomber Command would attack any ship damaged enough to have been slowed or brought to a stop.\n", "In June, the Royal Navy undertook Operation Harpoon and Operation Vigorous. The two convoys departed for Malta, the former from Gibraltar, the latter from Haifa and Port Said. The move was designed to split Axis naval forces attempting to intervene. Lloyd the AOC, wanted to give No. 601 Squadron over to convoy escort duty. Although he could afford this diversion, he could maintain a standing patrol of only four Spitfires over the convoy. If Axis aircraft attacked as they were withdrawing, they had to stay and fight. Bailing out if the pilots ran low on fuel was the only alternative to landing on Malta. The pilots had to hope that they would be picked up by the ships. The eastern convoy was forced to turn back after a series of naval and air engagements, despite the British ships still having 20% of their ammunition left. It was considered insufficient to see them into Malta. The losses of the convoy were heavy. Among the British losses was the cruiser . Three destroyers and 11 merchant vessels were also sunk. Malta did send Bristol Beauforts to engage the Italian fleet and German U-boats attacking the convoy. They torpedoed and sank the heavy cruiser and damaged the battleship . Two freighters of the western convoy reached Malta and delivered supplies, making them the only ships out of a total of 17 to deliver their loads, 25,000\u00a0tons of supplies. A further 16 Malta-based pilots were lost in the operations.\n", "On the night of Operation Chastise, 16/17\u00a0May 1943, Shannon was among a group of Lancasters led by Gibson in assaults on the M\u00f6hne and Eder Dams. After five of the aircraft had dropped their bouncing bombs on the M\u00f6hne, Shannon was preparing to make his attack on the dam when it gave way, so he carried on to the Eder with Gibson and three other Lancasters, captained by \"Dinghy\" Young, Henry Maudsley, and Les Knight. Detailed for the first bombing run at the Eder, Shannon took several attempts to familiarise himself with the area and line up his aircraft, so in the meantime Gibson ordered Maudsley to make his attack. Shannon went in next, delivering his bomb on target. Knight then dropped his bomb, and the dam broke.\n", "8 EBR troops at Sholoshahar were unaware of the attack on EBRC. Major Ziaur Rahman was away, making his way to port to unload ammunition from MV Swat around 11:45\u00a0pm while Major Mir Shawkat Ali had been ordered to take a company to the port. When some of the EBRC survivors reached 8 EBR lines begging for help, Captain Oli Ahmad (Oli Ahmed) began recalling EBR troops to Sholoshahar and arrested all Pakistani soldiers and officers of the unit. After taking controle of 8 EBR Captain Oli Ahmad (Oli Ahmed) sent Captain Khalekuzzaman to find Zia and bring him back. Captain Khalek managed to find Maj. Zia and get his escort of Pakistani troops back to 8 EBR lines, where Zia managed to arrest his escort and order Bengali troops to revolt. Bengali officers were divided in their opinion, some wanted to take on the 20 Baluch at EBRC to save Bengali lives, but ultimately it was decided that such a move would be suicidal. 8 EBR left the city and took position across the Kalurghat bridge around 1:15\u00a0am. Bengali troops killed all Pakistani prisoners including 8 EBR CO, Lt. Col. Janjua who was killed by his second in command Major Zia prior to moving out.\n", "As the boarding progressed, a soldier heard Sharp and his chief officer, H. Grattidge, say that were on the ship, as a lighter came alongside and Sharp decide that it would be the last to deliver passengers. Sharp and Grattidge kept watch on the sky as aircraft fought above the Loire estuary and German bombers tried to hit about distant; at \"Oronsay\" was bombed and part of the bridge destroyed. Sharp was advised by the captain of \"Havelock\" to leave at once but for fear of U-boats, Sharp wanted a destroyer escort. No destroyer was forthcoming and Sharp decided to leave with \"Oronsay\"; \"Lancastria\" stayed at anchor rather than being made a moving target. At more German bombers appeared, while the RAF Hurricanes were at the far end of their patrol line and a bomber hit \"Lancastria\" with three or four bombs. The ship tilted to starboard, the bridge crew shouted for everyone to go to the port side and \"Lancastria\" came level again, then keeled over to port.\n", "With the fate of the landing in the balance, Halsey ordered his carriers, under command of Rear-Admiral Frederick Sherman, to steam north through the night of 4\u20135 November to get within range of Rabaul for a daybreak raid on the base. Approaching behind the cover of a weather front, Sherman launched all 97 of his available aircraft against the target, leaving no aircraft behind for combat air patrol over his ships. The aircrews were ordered to damage as many warships as possible, rather than attempting to achieve a sinking. Aircraft from airfields on Barakoma and the recently captured Vella Lavella were sent out to sea to rendezvous with the carrier force to provide it with some measure of protection.\n", "\"Kaiser\" was to have taken part in a final fleet action days before the Armistice, an operation which envisioned the bulk of the High Seas Fleet sortieing from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet. In order to retain a better bargaining position for Germany, Admirals Hipper and Scheer intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, whatever the cost to the fleet. Consequently, on 29 October 1918, the order was given to depart from Wilhelmshaven to consolidate the fleet in the Jade roadstead, with the intention of departing the following morning. However, starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on mutinied. The unrest spread to other battleships, which forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation.\n", "Nelson in his letter of 9 March 1783, reports that he was in command of the squadron and the operation. Shortly after the squadron arrived at Turk's Island, \"Tartar\" left without explanation. Nelson states that he sent Dixon under a flag of truce to ask the French commander to surrender; the demand was refused. The British then landed 167 troops, under Dixon. Unexpectedly, a shore battery of three guns opened fire on the brigs. \"Drake\" master was wounded, as were some seven men aboard the \"General Barrington\". Dixon reported that seamen were manning the French guns and that the French troops had several field pieces. Nelson then decided to withdraw.\n"], "__answers__": ["First Lieutenant Israel Greene", "Brevet Colonel Robert E. Lee", "Colonel Robert E. Lee"]}}
