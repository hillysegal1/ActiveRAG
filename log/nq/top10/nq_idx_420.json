This passive movement is essential for the plant's ability to respond to internal and external cues.\n\n5. **Complex Interactions and Communication**: The interaction between different hormones creates a complex regulatory network that allows plants to adapt to their environment. Additionally, plants produce phytochemicals that can serve defensive roles against herbivores and pathogens, and facilitate communication with other plants through mycorrhizal networks. This communication can involve the transfer of nutrients and signaling molecules (infochemicals) that influence the behavior of connected plants.\n\n6. **Ecological and Agricultural Implications**: Understanding the roles of hormones and phytochemicals is vital for agricultural practices, such as developing plant growth regulators (PGRs) to enhance crop yields or manage pests. Insights into plant communication can inform ecological studies and conservation efforts, highlighting the interconnectedness of plant communities.\n\n7. **Evolutionary Perspective**: The ability of plants to produce a diverse array of hormones and chemicals reflects evolutionary adaptations that enhance survival and reproductive success in varying environments. This underscores the importance of chemical signaling in plant evolution and ecology.\n\n### Answer:\nPlant hormones (phytohormones) are the chemicals produced in one part of a plant that affect the growth and response of other parts. They play critical roles in regulating physiological processes such as flowering, fruiting, and responses to environmental stimuli. Key hormones include auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, and ethylene, each with specific functions that contribute to coordinated growth and development. Additionally, plants produce phytochemicals that facilitate communication and defense, enhancing their adaptability and survival in diverse environments.

Examples include auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, and ethylene, each with specific functions. Additionally, plants communicate through mycorrhizal networks using chemical signals, which can influence the behavior of connected plants. This highlights the complexity of plant interactions and the diversity of chemicals involved in their growth and development."}], "question_info": {"question": "chemicals produced in one part of a plant that affect the growth and response of other parts", "passages": ["The word hormone is derived from Greek, meaning \"set in motion\". Plant hormones affect gene expression and transcription levels, cellular division, and growth. They are naturally produced within plants, though very similar chemicals are produced by fungi and bacteria that can also affect plant growth. A large number of related chemical compounds are synthesized by humans. They are used to regulate the growth of cultivated plants, weeds, and in vitro-grown plants and plant cells; these manmade compounds are called plant growth regulators or PGRs for short. Early in the study of plant hormones, \"phytohormone\" was the commonly used term, but its use is less widely applied now.\n", "Phytochemicals are chemicals of plant origin. Phytochemicals (from Greek \"phyto\", meaning \"plant\") are chemicals produced by plants through primary or secondary metabolism. They generally have biological activity in the plant host and play a role in plant growth or defense against competitors, pathogens, or predators.\n", "Plant to plant communication via mycorrhizal networks refers to connections through mycorrhizal networks that facilitate communication between plants of the same or different species. Mycorrhizal networks allow for the transfers of signals and cues between plants which influence the behavior of the connected plants by inducing morphological or physiological changes. The chemical substances which act as these signals and cues are referred to as infochemicals. These can be allelochemicals, defensive chemicals or nutrients. Allelochemicals are used by plants to interfere with the growth or development of other plants or organisms, defensive chemicals can help plants in mycorrhizal networks defend themselves against attack by pathogens or herbivores, and transferred nutrients can affect growth and nutrition. Results of studies which demonstrate these modes of communication have led the authors to hypothesize mechanisms by which the transfer of these nutrients can affect the fitness of the connected plants.\n", "First, the study of phytochemistry (plant chemistry) is included within the domain of plant physiology. To function and survive, plants produce a wide array of chemical compounds not found in other organisms. Photosynthesis requires a large array of pigments, enzymes, and other compounds to function. Because they cannot move, plants must also defend themselves chemically from herbivores, pathogens and competition from other plants. They do this by producing toxins and foul-tasting or smelling chemicals. Other compounds defend plants against disease, permit survival during drought, and prepare plants for dormancy, while other compounds are used to attract pollinators or herbivores to spread ripe seeds.\n", "Fourthly, plant physiologists study the ways that plants control or regulate internal functions. Like animals, plants produce chemicals called hormones which are produced in one part of the plant to signal cells in another part of the plant to respond. Many flowering plants bloom at the appropriate time because of light-sensitive compounds that respond to the length of the night, a phenomenon known as photoperiodism. The ripening of fruit and loss of leaves in the winter are controlled in part by the production of the gas ethylene by the plant.\n", "Plants produce hormones and other growth regulators which act to signal a physiological response in their tissues. They also produce compounds such as phytochrome that are sensitive to light and which serve to trigger growth or development in response to environmental signals.\n", "Plant hormones are chemicals that in small amounts promote and influence the growth, development and differentiation of cells and tissues. Hormones are vital to plant growth; affecting processes in plants from flowering to seed development, dormancy, and germination. They regulate which tissues grow upwards and which grow downwards, leaf formation and stem growth, fruit development and ripening, as well as leaf abscission and even plant death.\n", "Physiological dormancy is broken when inhibiting chemicals are broken down or are no longer produced by the seed; often by a period of cool moist conditions, normally below (+4C) 39F, or in the case of many species in \"Ranunculaceae\" and a few others,(\u22125C) 24F. Abscisic acid is usually the growth inhibitor in seeds and its production can be affected by light. Some plants like Peony species have multiple types of physiological dormancy, one affects radicle (root) growth while the other affects plumule (shoot) growth. \n", "Plant hormones are not nutrients, but chemicals that in small amounts promote and influence the growth, development, and differentiation of cells and tissues. The biosynthesis of plant hormones within plant tissues is often diffuse and not always localized. Plants lack glands to produce and store hormones, because, unlike animals\u2014which have two circulatory systems (lymphatic and cardiovascular) powered by a heart that moves fluids around the body\u2014plants use more passive means to move chemicals around their bodies. Plants utilize simple chemicals as hormones, which move more easily through their tissues. They are often produced and used on a local basis within the plant body. Plant cells produce hormones that affect even different regions of the cell producing the hormone.\n", "Plant phytohormones have an effect on the growth and response of plants to environmental stimuli. Some of these phytohormones are involved in trichome formation, which include gibberellic acid (GA), cytokinins (CK), and jasmonic acids (JA). \n"], "__answers__": ["Plant hormones", "hormones"]}}
