The film is set in the Rocky Mountains and follows the journey of a man who becomes a mountain man, seeking solitude in the wilderness.\n\n1. **Contextual Understanding**: The genre of the film, being a Western, typically involves expansive natural landscapes, often featuring mountains, forests, and rugged terrain. This context suggests that the filming locations would likely be in areas that resemble the depicted environment.\n\n2. **Research on Filming Locations**: While the provided passages do not specify filming locations, I can draw on general knowledge about the film. \"Jeremiah Johnson\" was primarily filmed in Utah, particularly in the Wasatch Range and Uinta Mountains. These locations are known for their stunning natural beauty and mountainous terrain, which aligns with the film's setting.\n\n3. **Event Sequencing and Cultural Significance**: Understanding the film's premiere at the Cannes Film Festival and its American premiere in Boise, Idaho, provides insight into its production timeline. The choice of filming locations may have been influenced by logistical considerations, such as proximity to these premiere sites, but more importantly, the filmmakers likely sought locations that visually matched the film's narrative.\n\n4. **Logical Deductions**: Given the film's themes of wilderness survival and the mountain man lifestyle, it is reasonable to conclude that the filmmakers would choose locations that authentically represent these elements. The Uinta Mountains and Wasatch Range in Utah are well-known for their rugged beauty and would serve as ideal backdrops for such a story.\n\n### Answer:\nThe movie \"Jeremiah Johnson\" was filmed primarily in Utah, particularly in the Wasatch Range and Uinta Mountains.
