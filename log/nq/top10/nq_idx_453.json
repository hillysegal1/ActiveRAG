In 1939, the inaugural year of the NCAA tournament, the NIT was generally considered to be superior. During the 1940s, the relative status of the two tournaments was unclear, and thus some years produced disputed national championship claims. Some contemporary sources claim superiority for the NIT during this time. In 1943, in a shrewd competitive move the NCAA tournament began sharing Madison Square Garden with the NIT. In 1945, following victories by the NCAA champions over the NIT champions in the Red Cross games, \"The New York Times\" indicated that many teams who could potentially get bids to enter either tournament would probably choose the NCAA tournament \"because it involves stronger competition.\" In 1950, City College of New York won both the NIT and the NCAA tournaments in the same season, coincidentally defeating Bradley University in the championship game of both tournaments, and thus united the titles.\\n', \"In 1939, another national tournament was implemented by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The location of the NCAA Tournament varied from year to year, and it soon used multiple locations each year, so more fans could see games without traveling to New York. Although the NIT was created earlier and was more prestigious than the NCAA for many years, it ultimately lost popularity and status to the NCAA Tournament. In 1950, following a double win by the 1949\u201350 CCNY Beavers men's basketball team (when the NIT comprised 12 and the NCAA 8 teams), the NCAA ruled that no team could compete in both tournaments, and effectively indicated that a team eligible for the NCAA tournament should play in it. Not long afterward, assisted by the 1951 scandals based in New York City, the NCAA tournament had become more prestigious than before, with conference champions and the majority of top-ranked teams competing there. The NCAA tournament eventually overtook the NIT by 1960. Through the 1960s and 1970s, with UCLA leading the way as winner of ten NCAA Tournament championships, a shift in power to teams from the west amplified the shift of attention away from the New York City-based NIT. When the NCAA tournament expanded its field of teams from 25 to 32 in 1975, to 48 in 1980, to 64 in 1985, and to 68 teams in 2011, interest in the NCAA tournament increased again and again, as it comprised more and more teams, soon including all of the strongest ones. (Expansion also improved the distribution of playing locations, which number roughly one-third the number of teams in the field.)\\n\", 'BULLET::::- During 1939, Long Island University finished the regular season unbeaten but decided to accept instead an invitation to the second NIT (which they won) instead of the first and only NABC tournament (later called the NCAA tournament), as the NIT was more prestigious at the time. It wasn\\'t until the mid-1950s that the NCAA required that its tournament would have \"first choice\" in determining teams for their field. Before then, many of the more successful teams during the regular season chose to play in the NIT instead of the NCAA tournament.\\n', 'After the fall-out from the 1951 gambling and point-shaving scandals, the NCAA tournament pulled out of Madison Square Garden. With conference champions and the majority of the top-ranked teams participating in it, the NCAA tournament since then came to be regarded as the more important post-season tourney and the sole determiner of the national championship, although following the taint of the gambling scandals, the NIT was still considered a quality tournament for some time afterward. The NCAA built on the momentum of three consecutive Red Cross \"mythical national championship\" game victories over the NIT, eventually outmaneuvering the NIT by adeptly avoiding permanent damage from the 1951 gambling and point-shaving scandals and by adding more teams. As the NCAA Tournament steadily gained preeminence and became the sole source of naming the national champion, winners of the NCAA Tournament during those early years were given the same level of honor.\\n', 'The National Commissioners Invitational Tournament was an eight-team postseason college men\\'s basketball tournament run by the NCAA. It was introduced in 1974 as the Collegiate Commissioners Association Tournament. It was created because the NCAA wanted to \"kill\" the NIT, which, at that time, it did not control. It only lasted two years before being discontinued after changes to the NCAA Tournament which allowed more than one team per conference to participate.\\n', \"The inaugural National Invitation Tournament (NIT) was held in 1938. The following season, a second postseason college basketball tournament was founded: the NCAA Tournament, which was originally organized by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), although the NCAA did consider the event its basketball championship. The concept of the tournament was pitched to the association by Ohio State coach Harold Olsen. In October 1938, the NCAA announced that it approved the tournament's creation, as long as it was run by the NABC. The tournament featured an eight-team field, consisting of conference champions. The teams were divided into East and West regions.\\n\", 'As the NCAA tournament expanded its field to include more teams, the reputation of the NIT suffered. In 1973, NBC moved televised coverage of the NCAA championship from Saturday afternoon to Monday evening, providing the NCAA Tournament with prime-time television exposure the NIT could not match. Even more crucially, when the NCAA eliminated the one-team-per-conference rule in 1975, its requirement that teams accept its bids relegated the NIT to a collection of teams that did not make the NCAA grade.\\n', \"In 2005, the NCAA purchased 10-year rights to the NIT from the MIBA for $56.5 million to settle an antitrust lawsuit, which had gone to trial and was being argued until very shortly before the settlement was announced. The MIBA alleged that compelling teams to accept invitations to the NCAA tournament even if they preferred to play in the NIT was an illegal use of the NCAA's powers. In addition, it argued that the NCAA's expansion of its tournament to 65 teams (68 since 2011) was designed specifically to bankrupt the NIT. Faced with the very real possibility of being found in violation of federal antitrust law for the third time in its history, the NCAA chose to settle. (The first two violations were related to restrictions on televising college football and capping assistant coach salaries.) As part of the purchase of the NIT by the NCAA, the MIBA disbanded.\\n\", \"The first men's national championship tournament, the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball tournament, which still exists as the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) tournament, was organized in 1937.

Initially, the NIT was more prestigious, attracting top teams and players.\n   - In the early years, particularly the 1940s, the status of both tournaments was ambiguous, leading to disputes over national championships.\n\n2. **Competitive Dynamics**:\n   - The NCAA and NIT competed for teams and prestige, with the NCAA tournament sharing Madison Square Garden with the NIT in 1943.\n   - In 1945, victories by NCAA champions over NIT champions began to shift perceptions, with media outlets like \"The New York Times\" suggesting that the NCAA involved stronger competition.\n\n### Shift in Prestige\n3. **Key Events Leading to Change**:\n   - The 1950 double win by City College of New York (CCNY) in both tournaments highlighted the growing competition between the two.\n   - The NCAA's decision in 1950 to prohibit teams from participating in both tournaments marked a significant turning point, effectively steering teams towards the NCAA.\n\n4. **Impact of Scandals**:\n   - The gambling and point-shaving scandals of the early 1950s further tarnished the NIT's reputation while the NCAA capitalized on this by positioning itself as the premier tournament.\n   - Following the scandals, the NCAA tournament began to attract more top-ranked teams and conference champions, solidifying its status.\n\n### Expansion and Media Influence\n5. **Tournament Expansion**:\n   - The NCAA Tournament expanded its field from 25 teams in 1975 to 68 teams in 2011, increasing its appeal and inclusivity. This expansion allowed for greater media coverage and fan engagement.\n   - The move of NCAA championship broadcasts to prime-time slots in 1973 further enhanced its visibility compared to the NIT.\n\n6. **Final Shift in Perception**:\n   - By the 1960s, the NCAA Tournament had overtaken the NIT in prestige, with UCLA's dominance in the 1960s contributing to this shift.\n   - The NCAA's eventual acquisition of the NIT in 2005 marked the culmination of its efforts to establish itself as the sole authority in determining the national champion.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe NCAA Tournament became more important than the NIT primarily due to a combination of strategic decisions, competitive dynamics, and external events such as scandals. The NCAA's ability to attract top teams, expand its tournament, and secure prime media coverage played crucial roles in this shift. By the 1960s, the NCAA Tournament was firmly established as the premier postseason event in college basketball, a status it has maintained to this day. \n\nThis understanding not only highlights the historical significance of these tournaments but also illustrates the complex interplay of competition, media influence, and institutional decisions that shaped the landscape of college basketball."}, {"role": "user", "content": " Here is an answer generated by a language model with the reasoning process.\nquestion:\nwhen did the ncaa tournament became more important than the nit\nanswer:\nReasoning process: \nThe NCAA Tournament, also known as \"March Madness,\" has always been a significant event in college basketball, but its prominence compared to the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) has evolved over time.

The tournament's games are broadcast nationally, drawing in large audiences and sponsorships, which helped elevate its status.\n\n3. **Cultural Impact**: The NCAA Tournament became a cultural phenomenon, with the \"bracket\" system leading to widespread participation in office pools and betting, further embedding it into American culture.\n\n4. **Decline of the NIT**: The NIT began to lose its luster in the 1970s and 1980s, partly due to the NCAA Tournament's growing popularity. The NIT was often seen as a consolation prize for teams that did not make the NCAA Tournament, which diminished its prestige.\n\n5. **Official Recognition**: By the late 1980s and early 1990s, the NCAA Tournament was firmly established as the premier college basketball event, with the NIT being viewed as secondary.\n\nConsidering these factors, it can be concluded that the NCAA Tournament became more important than the NIT by the late 1980s, as it solidified its status as the main event in college basketball.\n\nAnswer: The NCAA Tournament became more important than the NIT by the late 1980s.\nTo deepen the language model's understanding of the question through familiarity with basic and advanced pieces of information.\nEncourage the language model to comprehend the question more thoroughly and expand its knowledge boundaries.\nI retrieved some foundational knowledge that is familiar to the model or advanced information beyond the language model's already familiar foundational knowledge from these passages. \nknowledge:\nThe passages provide a comprehensive overview of the historical context and evolution of the NCAA Tournament and the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), highlighting the shifting perceptions of their relative importance over time. Here\u2019s a consolidated summary and analysis of the key points:\n\n### Historical Context\n1. **Inception and Early Years**:\n   - The NIT was established in 1938, and the NCAA Tournament followed in 1939. Initially, the NIT was more prestigious, attracting top teams and players.\n   - In the early years, particularly the 1940s, the status of both tournaments was ambiguous, leading to disputes over national championships.\n\n2. **Competitive Dynamics**:\n   - The NCAA and NIT competed for teams and prestige, with the NCAA tournament sharing Madison Square Garden with the NIT in 1943.\n   - In 1945, victories by NCAA champions over NIT champions began to shift perceptions, with media outlets like \"The New York Times\" suggesting that the NCAA involved stronger competition.\n\n### Shift in Prestige\n3. **Key Events Leading to Change**:\n   - The 1950 double win by City College of New York (CCNY) in both tournaments highlighted the growing competition between the two.\n   - The NCAA's decision in 1950 to prohibit teams from participating in both tournaments marked a significant turning point, effectively steering teams towards the NCAA.\n\n4. **Impact of Scandals**:\n   - The gambling and point-shaving scandals of the early 1950s further tarnished the NIT's reputation while the NCAA capitalized on this by positioning itself as the premier tournament.\n   - Following the scandals, the NCAA tournament began to attract more top-ranked teams and conference champions, solidifying its status.\n\n### Expansion and Media Influence\n5. **Tournament Expansion**:\n   - The NCAA Tournament expanded its field from 25 teams in 1975 to 68 teams in 2011, increasing its appeal and inclusivity. This expansion allowed for greater media coverage and fan engagement.\n   - The move of NCAA championship broadcasts to prime-time slots in 1973 further enhanced its visibility compared to the NIT.\n\n6. **Final Shift in Perception**:\n   - By the 1960s, the NCAA Tournament had overtaken the NIT in prestige, with UCLA's dominance in the 1960s contributing to this shift.\n   - The NCAA's eventual acquisition of the NIT in 2005 marked the culmination of its efforts to establish itself as the sole authority in determining the national champion.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe NCAA Tournament became more important than the NIT primarily due to a combination of strategic decisions, competitive dynamics, and external events such as scandals. The NCAA's ability to attract top teams, expand its tournament, and secure prime media coverage played crucial roles in this shift. By the 1960s, the NCAA Tournament was firmly established as the premier postseason event in college basketball, a status it has maintained to this day. \n\nThis understanding not only highlights the historical significance of these tournaments but also illustrates the complex interplay of competition, media influence, and institutional decisions that shaped the landscape of college basketball.\nPlease verify the above reasoning process for errors, \nthen enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to deepen the understanding of the question through familiarity with basic and advanced pieces of information,\ncomprehend the question more thoroughly, and expand the knowledge boundaries.\nAfterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n\nGeneration Format:\nknowledge enhanced inference process:\nAnswer:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Knowledge Enhanced Inference Process:\n\nThe NCAA Tournament's rise to prominence over the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) is a multifaceted historical process that can be understood through several key developments:\n\n1. **Initial Prestige of the NIT**: Established in 1938, the NIT was initially viewed as the premier postseason tournament for college basketball. The NCAA Tournament, which began in 1939, struggled to attract the same level of attention and top-tier teams during its early years.\n\n2. **Competitive Dynamics**: Throughout the 1940s, both tournaments competed for teams and prestige. The NCAA's decision to share Madison Square Garden with the NIT in 1943 exemplified this rivalry. However, victories by NCAA champions over NIT champions in the mid-1940s began to shift public perception, suggesting that the NCAA offered stronger competition.\n\n3. **Significant Events**: The 1950 double victory by City College of New York (CCNY) in both tournaments highlighted the competition between the two. The NCAA's subsequent decision to prohibit teams from participating in both tournaments in 1950 effectively directed top teams toward the NCAA, further enhancing its status.\n\n4. **Impact of Scandals**: The gambling and point-shaving scandals of the early 1950s severely damaged the NIT's reputation. In contrast, the NCAA capitalized on this situation, attracting more top-ranked teams and solidifying its position as the premier tournament.\n\n5. **Expansion and Media Influence**: The NCAA Tournament's expansion from 25 teams in 1975 to 68 teams in 2011 significantly increased its visibility and inclusivity. The shift of NCAA championship broadcasts to prime-time slots in 1973 also contributed to its growing popularity, allowing it to reach a broader audience compared to the NIT.\n\n6. **Cultural Integration**: The NCAA Tournament became a cultural phenomenon, particularly with the introduction of the \"bracket\" system, which led to widespread participation in office pools and betting. This cultural integration further embedded the NCAA Tournament into American society.\n\n7. **Final Shift in Perception**: By the late 1980s, the NCAA Tournament had firmly established itself as the premier college basketball event, while the NIT was increasingly viewed as a secondary tournament. The NCAA's acquisition of the NIT in 2005 marked the culmination of its efforts to dominate the postseason landscape.\n\nIn summary, the NCAA Tournament became more important than the NIT primarily due to strategic decisions, competitive dynamics, and external events such as scandals. By the late 1980s, the NCAA Tournament had solidified its status as the main event in college basketball, a position it has maintained to this day.\n\n### Answer:\nThe NCAA Tournament became more important than the NIT by the late 1980s."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nwhen did the ncaa tournament became more important than the nit\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['During the early years of the two tournaments, the NCAA and NIT competed against each other, giving rise to debate over their relative prowess. In 1939, the inaugural year of the NCAA tournament, the NIT was generally considered to be superior. During the 1940s, the relative status of the two tournaments was unclear, and thus some years produced disputed national championship claims. Some contemporary sources claim superiority for the NIT during this time. In 1943, in a shrewd competitive move the NCAA tournament began sharing Madison Square Garden with the NIT. In 1945, following victories by the NCAA champions over the NIT champions in the Red Cross games, \"The New York Times\" indicated that many teams who could potentially get bids to enter either tournament would probably choose the NCAA tournament \"because it involves stronger competition.\" In 1950, City College of New York won both the NIT and the NCAA tournaments in the same season, coincidentally defeating Bradley University in the championship game of both tournaments, and thus united the titles.\\n', \"In 1939, another national tournament was implemented by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The location of the NCAA Tournament varied from year to year, and it soon used multiple locations each year, so more fans could see games without traveling to New York. Although the NIT was created earlier and was more prestigious than the NCAA for many years, it ultimately lost popularity and status to the NCAA Tournament. In 1950, following a double win by the 1949\u201350 CCNY Beavers men's basketball team (when the NIT comprised 12 and the NCAA 8 teams), the NCAA ruled that no team could compete in both tournaments, and effectively indicated that a team eligible for the NCAA tournament should play in it. Not long afterward, assisted by the 1951 scandals based in New York City, the NCAA tournament had become more prestigious than before, with conference champions and the majority of top-ranked teams competing there. The NCAA tournament eventually overtook the NIT by 1960. Through the 1960s and 1970s, with UCLA leading the way as winner of ten NCAA Tournament championships, a shift in power to teams from the west amplified the shift of attention away from the New York City-based NIT. When the NCAA tournament expanded its field of teams from 25 to 32 in 1975, to 48 in 1980, to 64 in 1985, and to 68 teams in 2011, interest in the NCAA tournament increased again and again, as it comprised more and more teams, soon including all of the strongest ones. (Expansion also improved the distribution of playing locations, which number roughly one-third the number of teams in the field.)\\n\", 'BULLET::::- During 1939, Long Island University finished the regular season unbeaten but decided to accept instead an invitation to the second NIT (which they won) instead of the first and only NABC tournament (later called the NCAA tournament), as the NIT was more prestigious at the time. It wasn\\'t until the mid-1950s that the NCAA required that its tournament would have \"first choice\" in determining teams for their field. Before then, many of the more successful teams during the regular season chose to play in the NIT instead of the NCAA tournament.\\n', 'After the fall-out from the 1951 gambling and point-shaving scandals, the NCAA tournament pulled out of Madison Square Garden. With conference champions and the majority of the top-ranked teams participating in it, the NCAA tournament since then came to be regarded as the more important post-season tourney and the sole determiner of the national championship, although following the taint of the gambling scandals, the NIT was still considered a quality tournament for some time afterward. The NCAA built on the momentum of three consecutive Red Cross \"mythical national championship\" game victories over the NIT, eventually outmaneuvering the NIT by adeptly avoiding permanent damage from the 1951 gambling and point-shaving scandals and by adding more teams. As the NCAA Tournament steadily gained preeminence and became the sole source of naming the national champion, winners of the NCAA Tournament during those early years were given the same level of honor.\\n', 'The National Commissioners Invitational Tournament was an eight-team postseason college men\\'s basketball tournament run by the NCAA. It was introduced in 1974 as the Collegiate Commissioners Association Tournament. It was created because the NCAA wanted to \"kill\" the NIT, which, at that time, it did not control. It only lasted two years before being discontinued after changes to the NCAA Tournament which allowed more than one team per conference to participate.\\n', \"The inaugural National Invitation Tournament (NIT) was held in 1938. The following season, a second postseason college basketball tournament was founded: the NCAA Tournament, which was originally organized by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), although the NCAA did consider the event its basketball championship. The concept of the tournament was pitched to the association by Ohio State coach Harold Olsen. In October 1938, the NCAA announced that it approved the tournament's creation, as long as it was run by the NABC. The tournament featured an eight-team field, consisting of conference champions. The teams were divided into East and West regions.\\n\", 'As the NCAA tournament expanded its field to include more teams, the reputation of the NIT suffered. In 1973, NBC moved televised coverage of the NCAA championship from Saturday afternoon to Monday evening, providing the NCAA Tournament with prime-time television exposure the NIT could not match. Even more crucially, when the NCAA eliminated the one-team-per-conference rule in 1975, its requirement that teams accept its bids relegated the NIT to a collection of teams that did not make the NCAA grade.\\n', \"In 2005, the NCAA purchased 10-year rights to the NIT from the MIBA for $56.5 million to settle an antitrust lawsuit, which had gone to trial and was being argued until very shortly before the settlement was announced. The MIBA alleged that compelling teams to accept invitations to the NCAA tournament even if they preferred to play in the NIT was an illegal use of the NCAA's powers. In addition, it argued that the NCAA's expansion of its tournament to 65 teams (68 since 2011) was designed specifically to bankrupt the NIT. Faced with the very real possibility of being found in violation of federal antitrust law for the third time in its history, the NCAA chose to settle. (The first two violations were related to restrictions on televising college football and capping assistant coach salaries.) As part of the purchase of the NIT by the NCAA, the MIBA disbanded.\\n\", \"The first men's national championship tournament, the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball tournament, which still exists as the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) tournament, was organized in 1937. The first national championship for NCAA teams, the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in New York, was organized in 1938; the NCAA national tournament would begin one year later. College basketball was rocked by gambling scandals from 1948 to 1951, when dozens of players from top teams were implicated in match fixing and point shaving. Partially spurred by an association with cheating, the NIT lost support to the NCAA tournament.\\n\", \"BULLET::::- NIT : The National Invitation Tournament, a postseason tournament for NCAA Division I men's basketball teams that do not qualify for the NCAA Tournament.

In 1939, the inaugural year of the NCAA tournament, the NIT was generally considered to be superior. During the 1940s, the relative status of the two tournaments was unclear, and thus some years produced disputed national championship claims. Some contemporary sources claim superiority for the NIT during this time. In 1943, in a shrewd competitive move the NCAA tournament began sharing Madison Square Garden with the NIT. In 1945, following victories by the NCAA champions over the NIT champions in the Red Cross games, \"The New York Times\" indicated that many teams who could potentially get bids to enter either tournament would probably choose the NCAA tournament \"because it involves stronger competition.\" In 1950, City College of New York won both the NIT and the NCAA tournaments in the same season, coincidentally defeating Bradley University in the championship game of both tournaments, and thus united the titles.\n", "In 1939, another national tournament was implemented by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The location of the NCAA Tournament varied from year to year, and it soon used multiple locations each year, so more fans could see games without traveling to New York. Although the NIT was created earlier and was more prestigious than the NCAA for many years, it ultimately lost popularity and status to the NCAA Tournament. In 1950, following a double win by the 1949\u201350 CCNY Beavers men's basketball team (when the NIT comprised 12 and the NCAA 8 teams), the NCAA ruled that no team could compete in both tournaments, and effectively indicated that a team eligible for the NCAA tournament should play in it. Not long afterward, assisted by the 1951 scandals based in New York City, the NCAA tournament had become more prestigious than before, with conference champions and the majority of top-ranked teams competing there. The NCAA tournament eventually overtook the NIT by 1960. Through the 1960s and 1970s, with UCLA leading the way as winner of ten NCAA Tournament championships, a shift in power to teams from the west amplified the shift of attention away from the New York City-based NIT. When the NCAA tournament expanded its field of teams from 25 to 32 in 1975, to 48 in 1980, to 64 in 1985, and to 68 teams in 2011, interest in the NCAA tournament increased again and again, as it comprised more and more teams, soon including all of the strongest ones. (Expansion also improved the distribution of playing locations, which number roughly one-third the number of teams in the field.)\n", "BULLET::::- During 1939, Long Island University finished the regular season unbeaten but decided to accept instead an invitation to the second NIT (which they won) instead of the first and only NABC tournament (later called the NCAA tournament), as the NIT was more prestigious at the time. It wasn't until the mid-1950s that the NCAA required that its tournament would have \"first choice\" in determining teams for their field. Before then, many of the more successful teams during the regular season chose to play in the NIT instead of the NCAA tournament.\n", "After the fall-out from the 1951 gambling and point-shaving scandals, the NCAA tournament pulled out of Madison Square Garden. With conference champions and the majority of the top-ranked teams participating in it, the NCAA tournament since then came to be regarded as the more important post-season tourney and the sole determiner of the national championship, although following the taint of the gambling scandals, the NIT was still considered a quality tournament for some time afterward. The NCAA built on the momentum of three consecutive Red Cross \"mythical national championship\" game victories over the NIT, eventually outmaneuvering the NIT by adeptly avoiding permanent damage from the 1951 gambling and point-shaving scandals and by adding more teams. As the NCAA Tournament steadily gained preeminence and became the sole source of naming the national champion, winners of the NCAA Tournament during those early years were given the same level of honor.\n", "The National Commissioners Invitational Tournament was an eight-team postseason college men's basketball tournament run by the NCAA. It was introduced in 1974 as the Collegiate Commissioners Association Tournament. It was created because the NCAA wanted to \"kill\" the NIT, which, at that time, it did not control. It only lasted two years before being discontinued after changes to the NCAA Tournament which allowed more than one team per conference to participate.\n", "The inaugural National Invitation Tournament (NIT) was held in 1938. The following season, a second postseason college basketball tournament was founded: the NCAA Tournament, which was originally organized by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), although the NCAA did consider the event its basketball championship. The concept of the tournament was pitched to the association by Ohio State coach Harold Olsen. In October 1938, the NCAA announced that it approved the tournament's creation, as long as it was run by the NABC. The tournament featured an eight-team field, consisting of conference champions. The teams were divided into East and West regions.\n", "As the NCAA tournament expanded its field to include more teams, the reputation of the NIT suffered.
