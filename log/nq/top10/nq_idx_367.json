In the context of FTP, this includes any information sent over the protocol that is not secured, allowing for potential interception.\n\n3. **Common FTP Header Information**: The FTP header typically includes:\n   - **Command**: The action being requested (e.g., USER, PASS, RETR, STOR).\n   - **Response Code**: A three-digit code indicating the status of the command (e.g., 200 for success, 530 for not logged in).\n   - **Response Message**: A textual description accompanying the response code, providing context for the status.\n   - **Data Transfer Information**: Details about the data being transferred, such as file names and sizes.\n\n4. **Examples of Clear Text Information**: \n   - Usernames and passwords (if sent in plain text).\n   - File names and paths.\n   - Status messages indicating success or failure of commands.\n   - Connection status messages.\n\n5. **Security Implications**: Since FTP transmits data in clear text, sensitive information such as usernames and passwords can be intercepted by malicious actors.
