It regularly publishes data on the percentage of the population living below the poverty line, which is crucial for understanding economic conditions.\n\n3. **Current Estimates**: As of the latest data available (up to October 2023), the percentage of the U.S. population living below the poverty line is estimated to be around 11-12%. This figure is consistent with historical data, which shows fluctuations in poverty rates due to various economic and social factors.\n\n4. **Historical Context**: \n   - In 2016, 12.7% of Americans were living below the poverty threshold.\n   - The percentage increased to 13.8% by 2007.\n   - In 2009, 11.1% of families were below the poverty line, indicating a significant number of families affected.\n   - Other reported figures include 15.5% and 18% in earlier years, highlighting the variability in poverty rates over time.\n\n5. **Demographic Insights**: A notable portion of individuals living below the poverty line are employed or actively seeking work, suggesting that poverty is not solely linked to unemployment.

The model should be trained to assess the reliability of information and recognize when conflicting data exists.\n\n8. **Implications for Policy and Support**: Recognizing that poverty affects different demographics in various ways can inform social policies and resource allocation. The model can infer that targeted interventions may be necessary to address the unique challenges faced by different groups.\n\n### Answer:\nApproximately 11-12% of the U.S. population lives below the poverty line, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau.
