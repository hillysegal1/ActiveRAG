Fatalities peaked in August with an estimated 31,159 deaths from plague, but continued to rage through September (6,978 died from plague in just the first week of September).

Samuel Pepys chronicled the epidemic in his diary.

It spread to other towns in East Anglia and the southeast of England but fewer than ten percent of parishes outside London had a higher than average death rate during those years.

This exodus reflected the widespread fear and uncertainty that gripped the city.\n   - Samuel Pepys, a prominent figure of the time, documented his experiences and observations in his diary, providing invaluable insights into the societal impact of the plague and the public's reaction to the crisis.\n\n4. **Long-term Consequences**:\n   - The last recorded death from plague in England occurred in 1679, and the disease was officially removed from mortality records by 1703. This marked a significant turning point in public health, as the understanding of disease transmission began to evolve.\n   - Following the Great Plague, sporadic cases continued to occur until the early 19th century, but the severity and mortality rates diminished significantly, indicating a gradual decline in the threat posed by the plague.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe Great Plague of London serves as a pivotal case study in understanding the dynamics of infectious diseases, urban public health, and societal responses to epidemics. By situating the outbreak within the broader context of the Second Pandemic and examining its impact on London and its inhabitants, one gains a deeper appreciation for the historical significance of this event. This enhanced understanding not only clarifies the timeline of the Great Plague but also highlights its lasting implications for public health and urban planning.\n\n### Answer:\nThe Great Plague of London started in 1665 and ended in 1666, with significant mortality peaking in August 1665. The epidemic is often associated with the Great Fire of London in September 1666, which helped to eradicate some of the unsanitary conditions that facilitated the spread of the plague, although the outbreak had already begun to decline by that time."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nwhen did the great plague of london start and end\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The Great Plague, lasting from 1665 to 1666, was the last major epidemic of the bubonic plague to occur in England.

Fatalities peaked in August with an estimated 31,159 deaths from plague, but continued to rage through September (6,978 died from plague in just the first week of September).

It happened within the centuries-long time period of the Second Pandemic, an extended period of intermittent bubonic plague epidemics which originated in China in 1331, the first year of the Black Death, an outbreak which included other forms such as pneumonic plague, and lasted until 1750.\n", "The unsanitary and overcrowded City of London had suffered from numerous outbreaks of the plague many times over the centuries, but in Britain it is the last major outbreak which is remembered as the \"Great Plague\". First manifesting itself in London in early 1665, the plague flared up dramatically that June as the flea population exploded in warm weather (there were 6,137 fatalities that month, compared to just 43 in May). Fatalities peaked in August with an estimated 31,159 deaths from plague, but continued to rage through September (6,978 died from plague in just the first week of September). Those with the means to do so fled London for the safety of the countryside, including Charles II and his court, which decamped to Salisbury in July and then to Oxford, where the King would remain until February 1666.\n", "The unsanitary and overcrowded City of London has suffered from the numerous outbreaks of the plague many times over the centuries, but in Britain it is the last major outbreak which is remembered as the \"Great Plague\" It occurred in 1665 and 1666 and killed around 60,000 people, which was one fifth of the population. Samuel Pepys chronicled the epidemic in his diary. On 4 September 1665 he wrote \"I have stayed in the city till above 7400 died in one week, and of them about 6000 of the plague, and little noise heard day or night but tolling of bells.\"\n", "From 1592-1593, London experienced its last major plague outbreak of the 16th Century. During this period, at least 15,000 people died of plague within the City of London and another 4,900 died of plague in the surrounding parishes.\n", "BULLET::::- 12 April: The first recorded victim of the Great Plague of London dies. On 7 July the King and court leave London to avoid the plague, moving first to Salisbury, then (from 25 September to 1 February 1666) Oxford (where in October Parliament convenes). The City begins use of Bunhill Fields as a burial ground for the victims.\n", "The Great Plague of 1665/1666 was the last major outbreak of bubonic plague in Great Britain. The last recorded death from plague came in 1679, and it was removed as a specific category in the Bills of Mortality after 1703. It spread to other towns in East Anglia and the southeast of England but fewer than ten percent of parishes outside London had a higher than average death rate during those years. Urban areas were more affected than rural ones; Norwich, Ipswich, Colchester, Southampton and Winchester were badly affected, while the West of England and areas of the Midlands escaped altogether.\n", "The plague returned at intervals with varying virulence and mortality until the early 19th century. In England, for example, the plague returned in 1360\u201363 killing 20% of Londoners and in 1369 killing 10\u201315%. In the 17th-century outbreaks were a series of \"great plagues\": the Great Plague of Seville (1647\u201352); the Great Plague of London (1665\u201366); and the Great Plague of Vienna (1679). In its virulent form, after the Great Plague of Marseille in 1720\u201322, the Great Plague of 1738 (which hit Eastern Europe), and the Russian plague of 1770\u20131772, it seems to have gradually disappeared from Europe though lingering in Egypt and the Middle East. By the early 19th\u00a0century, the threat of plague had diminished, but it was quickly replaced by a new disease. The Asiatic cholera was the first of several cholera pandemics to sweep through Asia and Europe during the 19th and 20th centuries.\n", "Plague cases continued to occur sporadically at a modest rate until the summer of 1666. On the second and third of September that year, the Great Fire of London destroyed much of the City of London, and some people believed that the fire put an end to the epidemic. However, it is now thought that the plague had largely subsided before the fire took place. In fact, most of the later cases of plague were found in the suburbs, and it was the City of London itself that was destroyed by the Fire.\n", "During the Great Plague of London in 1665, people boarded coaches at Whitehall, then at the edge of urban London, in an attempt to escape. The King and court temporarily moved to Oxford to avoid the plague, while Samuel Pepys remarked in his diary on 29 June, \"By water to Whitehall, where the Court is full of waggons and people ready to go out of town. This end of town every day grows very bad with plague\".\n", "The Great Plague was immediately followed by another catastrophe, albeit one which helped to put an end to the plague. On the Sunday, 2 September 1666 the Great Fire of London broke out at one o'clock in the morning at a bakery in Pudding Lane in the southern part of the City. Fanned by an eastern wind the fire spread, and efforts to arrest it by pulling down houses to make firebreaks were disorganised to begin with. On Tuesday night the wind fell somewhat, and on Wednesday the fire slackened. On Thursday it was extinguished, but on the evening of that day the flames again burst forth at the Temple. Some houses were at once blown up by gunpowder, and thus the fire was finally mastered. The Monument was built to commemorate the fire: for over a century and a half it bore an inscription attributing the conflagration to a \"\"popish frenzy\"\".\n"], "__answers__": ["1665 to 1666", "1665", "1666", "from 1665 to 1666"]}}
