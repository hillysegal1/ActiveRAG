Originating from an idea discussed by Harrison and Lynne during the sessions for Harrison\\'s 1987 album \"Cloud Nine\", the band formed in April 1988 after the five members united to record a bonus track for Harrison\\'s next European single. When this collaboration, \"Handle with Care\", was deemed too good for such a limited release, the group agreed to record a full album, titled \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1\". Following Orbison\\'s death in December 1988, the band released a second album, which they titled \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3\", in 1990.\\n', 'The Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 is the debut studio album by the English-American supergroup Traveling Wilburys, comprising George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison and Tom Petty. It was released in October 1988 to commercial success and critical acclaim. Although Harrison had long planned to start such a band, the project came about through happenstance. Harrison was in Los Angeles and in need of a B-side for a single from his \"Cloud Nine\" album, which resulted in the participants collaborating informally on the song \"Handle with Care\" at Dylan\\'s home. Adopting alter egos as the five Wilbury brothers, they then recorded a full album, produced by Lynne and Harrison.\\n', 'BULLET::::- Jim Keltner, drummer for the Traveling Wilburys\\n', 'The Traveling Wilburys\\n', 'The Traveling Wilburys consisted of four notable singers with decades of success behind them - George Harrison (The Beatles), Tom Petty (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers), Jeff Lynne (ELO) and Bob Dylan. \"The Traveling Wilburys Collection\" was a boxset of their two studio albums (\"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1\" and \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3\"), neither of which reached the top ten on their first release in 1988 and 1990 respectively.\\n', 'BULLET::::- Traveling Wilburys, a band featuring Tom Petty, frequent Petty collaborator Jeff Lynne, George Harrison, Roy Orbison and Bob Dylan\\n', 'Section::::Musical career.:1987\u201391: Traveling Wilburys.\\n', 'George Harrison and Jeff Lynne first discussed the idea for the Traveling Wilburys in early 1987 when they were recording \"Cloud Nine\", Harrison\\'s first album in five years. When Harrison suggested they should form their \"dream\" band, Lynne chose Roy Orbison as a potential bandmate, while Harrison\\'s first choice was Bob Dylan. Lynne later said that, although he thought Harrison was \"just joking\", \"Anything could happen with George, everybody loved him.\" The pair devised the term \"wilbury\" in response to mishaps occurring during the recording process that led to them having to \"bury\" the unwanted sound in the mix. In April 1988, after Warner Bros. Records had asked Harrison for an additional track for the European release of \"This Is Love\", the third single from \"Cloud Nine\", he and Lynne, together with Dylan, Orbison and Tom Petty, rush-recorded \"Handle with Care\". The song was deemed by Warner\\'s to be too good for such a limited release. Mo Ostin, the company\\'s chairman, instead encouraged Harrison to form the group he had long spoken of and record an album.\\n', 'Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3 is the second and final studio album by the Traveling Wilburys, a group consisting of George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Bob Dylan and Tom Petty.

The editors also recognise the band as \"the antithesis of a supergroup\", however, due to the musicians\\' adoption of fraternal alter egos and the humour inherent in the project. AllMusic managing editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine has similarly written: \"It\\'s impossible to picture a supergroup with a stronger pedigree than that (all that\\'s missing is a Rolling Stone), but in another sense it\\'s hard to call the Wilburys a true supergroup, since they arrived nearly two decades after the all-star craze of the \\'70s peaked, and they never had the self-important air of nearly all the other supergroups. That, of course, was the key to their charm \u2026\" Speaking to music journalist Paul Zollo in 2004, Petty agreed that humour and self-effacement had been key factors in the Wilburys\\' success, adding: \"We wanted to make something good in a world that seemed to get uglier and uglier and meaner and meaner \u2026 And I\\'m really proud that I was part of it.
