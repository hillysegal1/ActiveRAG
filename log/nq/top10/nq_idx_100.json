Sokolowski, a former political prisoner, was shot and killed by East German border troops while attempting to cross the Berlin Wall near to the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag building.\\n', 'Walter Ulbricht, the East German leader, invited Pervukhin to his summer house to discuss the East German immigration flow to West Germany. There Ulbricht told Pervukhin that if the Soviets did not react soon, East Germany would \"collapse\". Pervukhin discussed other problems as well, claiming that Ulbricht but also the East German leadership in general, were opposed to the Soviet Union\\'s plan to improve relations with West Germany. When Khrushchev gave his approval to construct what would become the Berlin Wall, Pervukhin was the first to know. Ulbricht told Pervukhin of the need to create the East\u2013West barrier at night, and he and Khrushchev would later agree to this.\\n', 'In 1975 he was sent back to Berlin where he served a second stint as Soviet ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, remaining in post this time till 1983. His years as ambassador were not without Soviet-East German tensions. During the early 1960s the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev was interested in exploring a less confrontational relationship with the west while the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht, remained uncompromisingly hard-line in his attitude to the west in general and in his country\\'s relationship with West Germany specifically. The decision suddenly to erect the Berlin Wall in August 1961 was naturally taken by the East Germans in full consultation with the Soviet ambassador. From the East German perspective The Wall represented a necessary desperate attempt to save the state which appeared to be in the process of losing its entire working age population. With Abrassimov as Soviet ambassador in Berlin, Walter Ulbricht, who had earlier enjoyed close relations with Soviet leader Josef Stalin, found he enjoyed far less direct contact with the Soviet leadership in Moscow. In 1963/64, when Ulbricht moved to control air traffic flying into West Berlin, it was Abrassimov who prevented the move. He actively opposed East German reluctance to conclude a belated post war peace treaty with West Germany, and in 1966 set up direct links with Willy Brandt, then the mayor of West Berlin, without telling the leadership of the East German ruling SED (party). Abrassimov also participated regularly in meetings of the East German cabinet, something which had never happened when Mikhail Pervukhin was the Soviet ambassador. The relationship between the Soviet ambassador and the East German leadership did not improve with the appointment of a new East German leader, Erich Honecker, in 1971. During the 1980s Abrassimov\\'s growing propensity to meet regularly with western ambassadors to Berlin without reference to his East German host government did not help matters. In 1983 he was seen to be becoming ever more paternalistic and autocratic in his ambassadorial office, and following the death of Leonid Brezhnev at the end of 1982, Honecker managed to persuade Moscow to replace Abrassimov because of the extent of his \"interference in East German domestic politics\".\\n', 'Walter Ulbricht (1893\u20131973) was the party boss from 1950 to 1971. In 1933, Ulbricht had fled to Moscow, where he served as a Comintern agent loyal to Stalin. As World War II was ending, Stalin assigned him the job of designing the postwar German system that would centralize all power in the Communist Party. Ulbricht became deputy prime minister in 1949 and secretary (chief executive) of the Socialist Unity (Communist) party in 1950. Some 2.6 million people had fled East Germany by 1961 when he built the Berlin Wall to stop them \u2014 shooting those who attempted it. What the GDR called the \"Anti-Fascist Protective Wall\" was a major embarrassment for the program during the Cold War, but it did stabilize East Germany and postpone its collapse. Ulbricht lost power in 1971, but was kept on as a nominal head of state. He was replaced because he failed to solve growing national crises, such as the worsening economy in 1969\u201370, the fear of another popular uprising as had occurred in 1953, and the disgruntlement between Moscow and Berlin caused by Ulbricht\\'s d\u00e9tente policies toward the West.\\n', \"After World War II, Germans tended to prefer living in West Germany over East Germany, and Berlin became a major escape route for people wanting to leave the Soviet sphere of influence for the West. This led to major-power conflict over Berlin that stretched at least from 1946 to the construction of the Berlin wall in 1961. After U.S. President Truman was replaced by Eisenhower in 1953 and Khrushchev became Soviet head of state in 1958, Khrushchev tried to push Eisenhower on Berlin in 1958-59.

Stalin agreed, calling the situation \"intolerable\".

In 1987, US President Ronald Reagan gave a speech at the Brandenburg Gate, challenging Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to \"tear down the wall\" which divided Berlin. The wall had stood as an icon for the political and economic division between East and West, a division that Churchill had referred to as the \"Iron Curtain\".

At that time, the leader of the Soviet Union was Nikita Khrushchev, who held power from 1953 until 1964. His leadership was characterized by significant Cold War events, including the construction of the Berlin Wall.\n\n1. **Nikita Khrushchev's Role**: Khrushchev's involvement in the Berlin Wall's construction is crucial. He agreed to allow East German leader Walter Ulbricht to proceed with the Wall's construction, indicating his approval and support for the East German government's actions to stem the emigration crisis. This decision was part of a broader strategy to maintain the stability of the Eastern Bloc amid rising tensions with the West.\n\n2. **Context of the Berlin Wall**: The Wall was erected in response to a massive wave of emigration from East Germany to West Germany, with approximately 2.6 million people fleeing by 1961. This mass exodus was seen as a direct threat to the East German state, prompting Ulbricht to take drastic measures to prevent further loss of population. Understanding this context is essential for grasping the motivations behind the Wall's construction.\n\n3. **East German Leadership**: Walter Ulbricht's hard-line policies and his collaboration with Khrushchev were pivotal in the decision to build the Wall. His leadership style and the pressures he faced from both the East German populace and the Soviet Union shaped the political landscape of the time. This relationship is vital for understanding the dynamics between East Germany and the Soviet Union.\n\n4. **Soviet-East German Relations**: The complexities of the relationship between Khrushchev and Ulbricht illustrate the broader geopolitical context. While Khrushchev sought to explore a less confrontational approach with the West, Ulbricht remained committed to a hard-line stance. This tension influenced the decision-making process regarding the Wall and reflects the internal conflicts within the Eastern Bloc.\n\n5. **Historical Significance**: The Berlin Wall became a powerful symbol of the Cold War, representing the ideological divide between East and West. Its construction not only stabilized East Germany temporarily but also delayed the eventual collapse of the East German state. Recognizing the Wall's significance in the Cold War narrative enhances our understanding of its impact on both German and global history.\n\nIn summary, the identification of Nikita Khrushchev as the Soviet leader during the construction of the Berlin Wall is essential. The context of mass emigration, the roles of key figures like Ulbricht, and the geopolitical dynamics of the time all contribute to a comprehensive understanding of this historical event.\n\n### Answer:\nNikita Khrushchev was the leader of the Soviet Union when the Berlin Wall was built on August 13, 1961."}], "associate": [{"role": "user", "content": " You are a cognitive scientist, to answer the following question:\nwho was the leader of the soviet union when the berlin wall was built\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['BULLET::::- On a visit to East Germany, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev agreed to let DDR leader Walter Ulbricht order construction of the Berlin Wall.\\n', 'Heinz Sokolowski (17 December 1917 \u2013 25 November 1965) was a German man who became the sixty-fourth known person to die at the Berlin Wall.

The Berlin Wall, constructed in August 1961, was a direct response to the crisis of emigration from East Germany and served both as a political and economic barrier. This event is a significant marker in Cold War history, representing the ideological divide between East and West and the lengths to which the Soviet Union would go to maintain its influence in Eastern Europe. \n\nUnderstanding these dynamics enhances comprehension of the historical context surrounding the Berlin Wall and the roles played by key figures like Khrushchev and Ulbricht in shaping the events of that era.\nPlease verify the above reasoning process for errors, \nthen enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to deepen the understanding of the question through familiarity with basic and advanced pieces of information,\ncomprehend the question more thoroughly, and expand the knowledge boundaries.\nAfterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n\nGeneration Format:\nknowledge enhanced inference process:\nAnswer:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Knowledge Enhanced Inference Process:\n\nTo determine who was the leader of the Soviet Union when the Berlin Wall was built, we start with the date of the wall's construction: August 13, 1961. This date is crucial for contextualizing the political landscape of the time.\n\n1. **Nikita Khrushchev's Leadership**: Nikita Khrushchev was indeed the leader of the Soviet Union during this period, having been in power from 1953 until 1964. His leadership was characterized by significant Cold War events, including the construction of the Berlin Wall. Khrushchev's agreement to allow East German leader Walter Ulbricht to construct the wall was a pivotal moment, reflecting the Soviet Union's strategic interests in maintaining control over Eastern Europe.\n\n2. **Context of the Berlin Wall**: The Berlin Wall was erected as a direct response to the mass emigration of East Germans to West Germany, which had reached alarming levels by 1961. Approximately 2.6 million people had fled East Germany, leading to a crisis that the East German government sought to address through the construction of the wall. This context highlights the urgency and desperation of the East German leadership, as well as the broader implications for Soviet influence in the region.\n\n3. **East German Leadership**: Walter Ulbricht, the leader of East Germany, played a crucial role in the decision to build the wall. His hardline stance against the West and commitment to preserving the East German state were significant factors in the wall's construction. The collaboration between Ulbricht and Khrushchev underscores the interconnectedness of Soviet and East German policies during this period.\n\n4. **Soviet-East German Relations**: The relationship between the Soviet Union and East Germany was complex and often fraught with tension. While Khrushchev sought a less confrontational approach towards the West, Ulbricht's hardline policies sometimes conflicted with Soviet interests. The decision to build the Berlin Wall was made in consultation with Soviet officials, illustrating the influence of Soviet leadership on East German actions.\n\n5. **Political and Economic Implications**: The Berlin Wall served as a powerful symbol of the Cold War, representing the ideological divide between communism and capitalism. It was not only a political barrier but also an economic measure aimed at stabilizing the East German economy by preventing the outflow of labor and resources. Khrushchev's acknowledgment of the wall's role in stabilizing East Germany further emphasizes its significance.\n\n6. **Historical Context**: The construction of the Berlin Wall occurred during a period of heightened tensions in the Cold War, following earlier confrontations over Berlin. Khrushchev's attempts to negotiate with Western leaders, including U.S. Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy, were part of a broader strategy to assert Soviet influence in Eastern Europe. This historical context is essential for understanding the motivations behind the wall's construction.\n\n### Answer:\nThe leader of the Soviet Union when the Berlin Wall was built was Nikita Khrushchev. His leadership during this critical period was marked by significant Cold War tensions and the decision to support the construction of the wall as a means to stem the emigration crisis from East Germany. The Berlin Wall, erected on August 13, 1961, symbolized the ideological divide between East and West and served both political and economic purposes in stabilizing East Germany. Understanding the dynamics between Khrushchev and East German leader Walter Ulbricht, as well as the broader geopolitical context, enhances our comprehension of this pivotal moment in history."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nwho was the leader of the soviet union when the berlin wall was built\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['BULLET::::- On a visit to East Germany, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev agreed to let DDR leader Walter Ulbricht order construction of the Berlin Wall.\\n', 'Heinz Sokolowski (17 December 1917 \u2013 25 November 1965) was a German man who became the sixty-fourth known person to die at the Berlin Wall.

There Ulbricht told Pervukhin that if the Soviets did not react soon, East Germany would \"collapse\". Pervukhin discussed other problems as well, claiming that Ulbricht but also the East German leadership in general, were opposed to the Soviet Union\\'s plan to improve relations with West Germany. When Khrushchev gave his approval to construct what would become the Berlin Wall, Pervukhin was the first to know. Ulbricht told Pervukhin of the need to create the East\u2013West barrier at night, and he and Khrushchev would later agree to this.\\n', 'In 1975 he was sent back to Berlin where he served a second stint as Soviet ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, remaining in post this time till 1983. His years as ambassador were not without Soviet-East German tensions. During the early 1960s the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev was interested in exploring a less confrontational relationship with the west while the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht, remained uncompromisingly hard-line in his attitude to the west in general and in his country\\'s relationship with West Germany specifically. The decision suddenly to erect the Berlin Wall in August 1961 was naturally taken by the East Germans in full consultation with the Soviet ambassador. From the East German perspective The Wall represented a necessary desperate attempt to save the state which appeared to be in the process of losing its entire working age population. With Abrassimov as Soviet ambassador in Berlin, Walter Ulbricht, who had earlier enjoyed close relations with Soviet leader Josef Stalin, found he enjoyed far less direct contact with the Soviet leadership in Moscow. In 1963/64, when Ulbricht moved to control air traffic flying into West Berlin, it was Abrassimov who prevented the move. He actively opposed East German reluctance to conclude a belated post war peace treaty with West Germany, and in 1966 set up direct links with Willy Brandt, then the mayor of West Berlin, without telling the leadership of the East German ruling SED (party). Abrassimov also participated regularly in meetings of the East German cabinet, something which had never happened when Mikhail Pervukhin was the Soviet ambassador. The relationship between the Soviet ambassador and the East German leadership did not improve with the appointment of a new East German leader, Erich Honecker, in 1971. During the 1980s Abrassimov\\'s growing propensity to meet regularly with western ambassadors to Berlin without reference to his East German host government did not help matters. In 1983 he was seen to be becoming ever more paternalistic and autocratic in his ambassadorial office, and following the death of Leonid Brezhnev at the end of 1982, Honecker managed to persuade Moscow to replace Abrassimov because of the extent of his \"interference in East German domestic politics\".\\n', 'Walter Ulbricht (1893\u20131973) was the party boss from 1950 to 1971. In 1933, Ulbricht had fled to Moscow, where he served as a Comintern agent loyal to Stalin. As World War II was ending, Stalin assigned him the job of designing the postwar German system that would centralize all power in the Communist Party. Ulbricht became deputy prime minister in 1949 and secretary (chief executive) of the Socialist Unity (Communist) party in 1950. Some 2.6 million people had fled East Germany by 1961 when he built the Berlin Wall to stop them \u2014 shooting those who attempted it. What the GDR called the \"Anti-Fascist Protective Wall\" was a major embarrassment for the program during the Cold War, but it did stabilize East Germany and postpone its collapse. Ulbricht lost power in 1971, but was kept on as a nominal head of state. He was replaced because he failed to solve growing national crises, such as the worsening economy in 1969\u201370, the fear of another popular uprising as had occurred in 1953, and the disgruntlement between Moscow and Berlin caused by Ulbricht\\'s d\u00e9tente policies toward the West.\\n', \"After World War II, Germans tended to prefer living in West Germany over East Germany, and Berlin became a major escape route for people wanting to leave the Soviet sphere of influence for the West. This led to major-power conflict over Berlin that stretched at least from 1946 to the construction of the Berlin wall in 1961. After U.S. President Truman was replaced by Eisenhower in 1953 and Khrushchev became Soviet head of state in 1958, Khrushchev tried to push Eisenhower on Berlin in 1958-59.

To determine the leader of the Soviet Union at that time, we need to consider the historical context and the relevant details from authoritative sources.\n\n1. **Identification of the Leader**: The leader of the Soviet Union during the early 1960s was Nikita Khrushchev. He held power from 1953 until 1964. This timeframe includes the construction of the Berlin Wall, which was a significant event in the Cold War.\n\n2. **Khrushchev's Involvement**: Historical records indicate that Khrushchev played a direct role in the decision to construct the Berlin Wall. He agreed to the East German leader Walter Ulbricht's request to build the Wall, which was intended to halt the mass emigration from East Germany to West Germany. This context is crucial as it highlights the collaborative decision-making between the Soviet Union and East Germany.\n\n3. **Context of the Berlin Wall's Construction**: The construction of the Berlin Wall was a response to the crisis of emigration, with approximately 2.6 million East Germans fleeing to the West by 1961. The Wall was seen as a necessary measure to stabilize East Germany and prevent its collapse, which was a concern for both Khrushchev and Ulbricht.\n\n4. **Khrushchev's Leadership Style**: Khrushchev's leadership was characterized by a mix of confrontational and conciliatory approaches toward the West. His agreement to the construction of the Wall reflects the complexities of Soviet-East German relations during a tense period of the Cold War.\n\n5. **Confirmation from Authoritative Sources**: The passages retrieved confirm that Khrushchev was indeed the Soviet leader during the construction of the Berlin Wall and provide insights into the political dynamics at play.

Sokolowski, a former political prisoner, was shot and killed by East German border troops while attempting to cross the Berlin Wall near to the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag building.\n", "Walter Ulbricht, the East German leader, invited Pervukhin to his summer house to discuss the East German immigration flow to West Germany. There Ulbricht told Pervukhin that if the Soviets did not react soon, East Germany would \"collapse\". Pervukhin discussed other problems as well, claiming that Ulbricht but also the East German leadership in general, were opposed to the Soviet Union's plan to improve relations with West Germany. When Khrushchev gave his approval to construct what would become the Berlin Wall, Pervukhin was the first to know. Ulbricht told Pervukhin of the need to create the East\u2013West barrier at night, and he and Khrushchev would later agree to this.\n", "In 1975 he was sent back to Berlin where he served a second stint as Soviet ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, remaining in post this time till 1983. His years as ambassador were not without Soviet-East German tensions. During the early 1960s the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev was interested in exploring a less confrontational relationship with the west while the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht, remained uncompromisingly hard-line in his attitude to the west in general and in his country's relationship with West Germany specifically. The decision suddenly to erect the Berlin Wall in August 1961 was naturally taken by the East Germans in full consultation with the Soviet ambassador. From the East German perspective The Wall represented a necessary desperate attempt to save the state which appeared to be in the process of losing its entire working age population. With Abrassimov as Soviet ambassador in Berlin, Walter Ulbricht, who had earlier enjoyed close relations with Soviet leader Josef Stalin, found he enjoyed far less direct contact with the Soviet leadership in Moscow. In 1963/64, when Ulbricht moved to control air traffic flying into West Berlin, it was Abrassimov who prevented the move. He actively opposed East German reluctance to conclude a belated post war peace treaty with West Germany, and in 1966 set up direct links with Willy Brandt, then the mayor of West Berlin, without telling the leadership of the East German ruling SED (party). Abrassimov also participated regularly in meetings of the East German cabinet, something which had never happened when Mikhail Pervukhin was the Soviet ambassador. The relationship between the Soviet ambassador and the East German leadership did not improve with the appointment of a new East German leader, Erich Honecker, in 1971. During the 1980s Abrassimov's growing propensity to meet regularly with western ambassadors to Berlin without reference to his East German host government did not help matters. In 1983 he was seen to be becoming ever more paternalistic and autocratic in his ambassadorial office, and following the death of Leonid Brezhnev at the end of 1982, Honecker managed to persuade Moscow to replace Abrassimov because of the extent of his \"interference in East German domestic politics\".\n", "Walter Ulbricht (1893\u20131973) was the party boss from 1950 to 1971. In 1933, Ulbricht had fled to Moscow, where he served as a Comintern agent loyal to Stalin. As World War II was ending, Stalin assigned him the job of designing the postwar German system that would centralize all power in the Communist Party. Ulbricht became deputy prime minister in 1949 and secretary (chief executive) of the Socialist Unity (Communist) party in 1950. Some 2.6 million people had fled East Germany by 1961 when he built the Berlin Wall to stop them \u2014 shooting those who attempted it. What the GDR called the \"Anti-Fascist Protective Wall\" was a major embarrassment for the program during the Cold War, but it did stabilize East Germany and postpone its collapse. Ulbricht lost power in 1971, but was kept on as a nominal head of state. He was replaced because he failed to solve growing national crises, such as the worsening economy in 1969\u201370, the fear of another popular uprising as had occurred in 1953, and the disgruntlement between Moscow and Berlin caused by Ulbricht's d\u00e9tente policies toward the West.\n", "After World War II, Germans tended to prefer living in West Germany over East Germany, and Berlin became a major escape route for people wanting to leave the Soviet sphere of influence for the West. This led to major-power conflict over Berlin that stretched at least from 1946 to the construction of the Berlin wall in 1961. After U.S. President Truman was replaced by Eisenhower in 1953 and Khrushchev became Soviet head of state in 1958, Khrushchev tried to push Eisenhower on Berlin in 1958-59. The Soviets backed down when Ike's resolve seemed to match that of Truman. When Ike was replaced by Kennedy in 1961, Khrushchev tried again, with essentially the same result.\n", "Up until 1952, the demarcation lines between East Germany and the western occupied zones could be easily crossed in most places. On 1 April 1952, East German leaders met the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in Moscow; during the discussions Stalin's foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov proposed that the East Germans should \"introduce a system of passes for visits of West Berlin residents to the territory of East Berlin [so as to stop] free movement of Western agents\" in the GDR. Stalin agreed, calling the situation \"intolerable\". He advised the East Germans to build up their border defenses, telling them that \"The demarcation line between East and West Germany should be considered a border\u2014and not just any border, but a dangerous one ... The Germans will guard the line of defence with their lives.\"\n", "In a speech at the Brandenburg Gate commemorating the 750th anniversary of Berlin on 12 June 1987, U.S. President Ronald Reagan challenged Mikhail Gorbachev, then the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to tear down the Wall as a symbol of increasing freedom in the Eastern Bloc:\n", "BULLET::::- Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev made a visit to the Berlin Wall from the East Berlin side, then delivered an address to the Communist leadership of East Germany at the SED Party Congress. Khrushchev stated bluntly that the Wall had accomplished its purpose of stemming the exodus of citizens from the nation and stabilized the East German economy, and added that further Soviet economic assistance would not be forthcoming. \"Neither God nor the devil will give you bread or butter if you do not manage it with your own hands,\" Khrushchev said, adding that East Germany \"must not expect alms from some rich uncle\".\n", "Into the 1980s, the Soviet Union experienced a period of economic and political stagnation, and correspondingly decreased intervention in Eastern Bloc politics. In 1987, US President Ronald Reagan gave a speech at the Brandenburg Gate, challenging Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to \"tear down the wall\" which divided Berlin. The wall had stood as an icon for the political and economic division between East and West, a division that Churchill had referred to as the \"Iron Curtain\". Gorbachev announced in 1988 that the Soviet Union would abandon the Brezhnev Doctrine and allow the Eastern bloc nations to freely determine their own internal affairs. In early 1989, under a new era of Soviet policies of \"glasnost\" (openness), \"perestroika\" (economic restructuring) and taken further by Gorbachev, the Solidarity movement took hold in Poland. Further inspired by other images of brave defiance, a wave of revolutions swept throughout the Eastern Bloc that year. In May 1989, Hungary removed their border fence and thousands of East Germans escaped to the West \u2014 although even then, very many people inside and outside Germany still believed that a real reunification would never happen in the foreseeable future.\n"], "__answers__": ["Khrushchev", "Joseph Stalin", "Nikita Khrushchev"]}}
