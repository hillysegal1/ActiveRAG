However, this bill was never circulated to the general public; it was used exclusively for transactions between Federal Reserve Banks. This distinction is crucial because it highlights that while it is the highest denomination printed, it was not available for everyday use.\n\n2. **Largest Bill in Public Circulation**: The largest bill that was circulated to the public is the $10,000 bill, which features the portrait of Salmon P. Chase. This bill was last printed in 1945 and was officially retired from circulation in 1969 due to the increasing reliance on checks and electronic payments. As of 2009, only a limited number of these bills remained unreturned for destruction, indicating their rarity.\n\n3. **Current Largest Bill**: The largest bill currently in circulation is the $100 bill, which features Benjamin Franklin. This denomination has been in circulation since 1969, following the retirement of larger denominations like the $500, $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000 bills. The $100 bill is significant not only for its value but also for its widespread acceptance and use in everyday transactions.\n\n4. **Historical Context and Significance**: The existence of high-denomination bills like the $10,000 bill reflects historical banking practices, where large transactions were common before the advent of electronic banking. The retirement of these bills marks a shift in how currency is used in the economy. Additionally, the $100,000 Gold Certificate represents a unique aspect of U.S. currency history, as it was backed by gold bullion, emphasizing the historical role of gold in the monetary system.\n\n5. **Cultural Representation**: The portraits on these bills, such as those of Benjamin Franklin and Salmon P. Chase, signify important figures in American history and serve as a reflection of national identity. This cultural aspect adds depth to the understanding of U.S. currency beyond its face value.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, while the $100,000 Gold Certificate is the largest note ever printed, it was not available for public use. The largest bill that was circulated to the public is the $10,000 bill. Currently, the largest bill in circulation is the $100 bill. Understanding these distinctions and the historical context surrounding these denominations enhances our comprehension of U.S. currency and its significance in both economic and cultural terms.\n\n### Answer:\nThe largest bill in American money that was circulated to the public is the $10,000 bill, while the largest bill ever printed is the $100,000 Gold Certificate, which was not available for general circulation.
