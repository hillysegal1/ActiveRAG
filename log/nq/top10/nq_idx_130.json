This practice is not universally adopted across all states in the U.S.\n\n2. **States Opting Out of DST**: Some states have chosen not to observe DST due to geographical considerations, public preference, or legislative actions. The primary states that do not observe DST are Hawaii and most of Arizona. Hawaii does not observe DST at all, while Arizona does not observe it except for the Navajo Nation, which does observe DST.\n\n3. **Exceptions and Nuances**: The Navajo Nation, which extends into Arizona, is an important exception to the general rule regarding Arizona's DST observance. This highlights the complexity of time observance policies, particularly in areas with tribal governance.\n\n4. **Historical Context**: The historical context is crucial for understanding DST observance. For example, before 2006, most of Indiana did not observe DST, but the entire state has been observing it since then. Additionally, prior to 1966, there was no federal law mandating DST, allowing localities to choose their observance.\n\n5. **Legislative Proposals**: Some states, particularly in New England, have proposed bills to adopt year-round Atlantic Standard Time, effectively opting out of DST. Washington State has also enacted a bill for year-round DST pending congressional approval, indicating ongoing legislative interest in this area.\n\n6. **Categorization and Classification**: By categorizing states and territories that do not observe DST, the model can improve its ability to classify and differentiate between various entities based on their observance status. This is crucial for logical reasoning and understanding broader patterns.\n\n7. **Causal Relationships**: The model can infer causal relationships, such as how local customs, public opinion, and legislative actions can lead to changes in time observance policies. Understanding these relationships enhances the model's ability to reason about social and political contexts.\n\n8. **Verification of Current Status**: It is important to note that the status of DST observance can change due to new legislation or public initiatives, so ongoing verification is necessary to maintain accuracy.\n\n### Answer:\nHawaii and most of Arizona do not allow Daylight Saving Time.
