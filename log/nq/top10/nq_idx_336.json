This unique characteristic is significant because it affects the planet's day-night cycle and atmospheric dynamics.\n\n7. **Tidal Effects and Atmospheric Influence**: The dynamics of Venus's rotation and revolution are influenced by gravitational tidal forces and its thick atmosphere. These factors contribute to its slow retrograde rotation and help explain the planet's unique characteristics, such as its lack of a significant magnetic field and its extreme surface conditions.\n\n8. **Implications of the Findings**: Understanding the revolution period of Venus not only answers the question but also provides insights into the planet's behavior in the solar system. The interplay between its orbital and rotational dynamics is crucial for comprehending phenomena such as transits and the planet's overall climate.\n\n### Answer:\nThe revolution period of Venus is approximately **0.615 Earth years**, which corresponds to about **224.7 Earth days**. This understanding is enriched by recognizing that Venus's rotation period is longer than its revolution period, leading to unique day-night cycles on the planet.

The rotation period of Venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun's gravitation, which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick Venusian atmosphere.\\n\", \"Sequences of transits usually repeat every 243 years. After this period of time Venus and Earth have returned to very nearly the same point in their respective orbits. During the Earth's 243 sidereal orbital periods, which total 88,757.3 days, Venus completes 395 sidereal orbital periods of 224.701 days each, equal to 88,756.9 Earth days.

Thus Venus's synodic period, which gives the time between two subsequent eastern (or western) greatest elongations, is 584 days.\\n\", \"It is unlikely that Venus was formed with its present slow retrograde rotation, which takes 243 days. Venus probably began with a fast prograde rotation with a period of several hours much like most of the planets in the Solar System. Venus is close enough to the Sun to experience significant gravitational tidal dissipation, and also has a thick enough atmosphere to create thermally driven atmospheric tides that create a retrograde torque. Venus' present slow retrograde rotation is in equilibrium balance between gravitational tides trying to tidally lock Venus to the Sun and atmospheric tides trying to spin Venus in a retrograde direction. In addition to maintaining this present day equilibrium, tides are also sufficient to account for evolution of Venus's rotation from a primordial fast prograde direction to its present-day slow retrograde rotation. In the past, various alternative hypotheses have been proposed to explain Venus' retrograde rotation, such as collisions or it having originally formed that way.\\n\", 'In the 19th century, many observers stated that Venus had a period of rotation of roughly 24 hours. Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli was the first to predict a significantly slower rotation, proposing that Venus was tidally locked with the Sun (as he had also proposed for Mercury). While not actually true for either body, this was still a reasonably accurate estimate. The near-resonance between its rotation and its closest approach to Earth helped to create this impression, as Venus always seemed to be facing the same direction when it was in the best location for observations to be made. The rotation rate of Venus was first measured during the 1961 conjunction, observed by radar from a 26 m antenna at Goldstone, California, the Jodrell Bank Radio Observatory in the UK, and the Soviet deep space facility in Yevpatoria, Crimea. Accuracy was refined at each subsequent conjunction, primarily from measurements made from Goldstone and Eupatoria. The fact that rotation was retrograde was not confirmed until 1964.\\n', 'All the planets in the Solar System orbit the Sun in a anticlockwise direction as viewed from above Earth\\'s north pole.

This information is crucial for understanding the day-night cycle on Venus and emphasizes the planet's unusual rotational dynamics.\n\n6. **Potential Contradictions**: If the model previously indicated that Venus's revolution period is longer than its rotation period, this would be incorrect. The model should be updated to reflect that Venus's revolution period (approximately 224.701 days) is shorter than its rotation period (243 days).\n\nBy integrating these points, the model can provide a more accurate representation of Venus's orbital and rotational characteristics, thereby preventing misconceptions and factual errors.\n\n### Answer:\nThe revolution period of Venus is approximately **0.615 Earth years** (or about **224.701 Earth days**)."}], "question_info": {"question": "what is the revolution period of venus in earth years", "passages": ["Venus may have formed from the solar nebula with a different rotation period and obliquity, reaching its current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and tidal effects on its dense atmosphere, a change that would have occurred over the course of billions of years. The rotation period of Venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun's gravitation, which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick Venusian atmosphere.\n", "Sequences of transits usually repeat every 243 years. After this period of time Venus and Earth have returned to very nearly the same point in their respective orbits. During the Earth's 243 sidereal orbital periods, which total 88,757.3 days, Venus completes 395 sidereal orbital periods of 224.701 days each, equal to 88,756.9 Earth days. This period of time corresponds to 152 synodic periods of Venus.\n", "BULLET::::- The period of Jupiter's revolution is 11.86 years, so Jupiter is called the \"age star\" (); 30\u00b0 of Jupiter's revolution is about a year on earth.\n", "Notorious examples are the great Venus term and the Jupiter\u2013Saturn great inequality. Looking up the revolution periods of these planets, one may notice that 8\u00d7(period of Earth) is almost equal to 13\u00d7(period of Venus) and 5\u00d7(period of Jupiter) is about 2\u00d7(period of Saturn).\n", "For example, Venus's year (sidereal period) is 225 days, and Earth's is 365 days. Thus Venus's synodic period, which gives the time between two subsequent eastern (or western) greatest elongations, is 584 days.\n", "It is unlikely that Venus was formed with its present slow retrograde rotation, which takes 243 days. Venus probably began with a fast prograde rotation with a period of several hours much like most of the planets in the Solar System. Venus is close enough to the Sun to experience significant gravitational tidal dissipation, and also has a thick enough atmosphere to create thermally driven atmospheric tides that create a retrograde torque. Venus' present slow retrograde rotation is in equilibrium balance between gravitational tides trying to tidally lock Venus to the Sun and atmospheric tides trying to spin Venus in a retrograde direction. In addition to maintaining this present day equilibrium, tides are also sufficient to account for evolution of Venus's rotation from a primordial fast prograde direction to its present-day slow retrograde rotation. In the past, various alternative hypotheses have been proposed to explain Venus' retrograde rotation, such as collisions or it having originally formed that way.\n", "In the 19th century, many observers stated that Venus had a period of rotation of roughly 24 hours. Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli was the first to predict a significantly slower rotation, proposing that Venus was tidally locked with the Sun (as he had also proposed for Mercury). While not actually true for either body, this was still a reasonably accurate estimate. The near-resonance between its rotation and its closest approach to Earth helped to create this impression, as Venus always seemed to be facing the same direction when it was in the best location for observations to be made. The rotation rate of Venus was first measured during the 1961 conjunction, observed by radar from a 26 m antenna at Goldstone, California, the Jodrell Bank Radio Observatory in the UK, and the Soviet deep space facility in Yevpatoria, Crimea. Accuracy was refined at each subsequent conjunction, primarily from measurements made from Goldstone and Eupatoria. The fact that rotation was retrograde was not confirmed until 1964.\n", "All the planets in the Solar System orbit the Sun in a anticlockwise direction as viewed from above Earth's north pole. Most planets also rotate on their axes in an anti-clockwise direction, but Venus rotates clockwise in retrograde rotation once every 243\u00a0Earth\u00a0days\u2014the slowest rotation of any planet. Because its rotation is so slow, Venus is very close to spherical. A Venusian sidereal day thus lasts longer than a Venusian year (243 versus 224.7 Earth days). Venus's equator rotates at , whereas Earth's rotates at . Venus's rotation has slowed down in the 16\u00a0years between the \"Magellan\" spacecraft and \"Venus Express\" visits; each Venusian sidereal day has increased by 6.5\u00a0minutes in that time span. Because of the retrograde rotation, the length of a solar day on Venus is significantly shorter than the sidereal day, at 116.75\u00a0Earth\u00a0days (making the Venusian solar day shorter than Mercury's 176\u00a0Earth\u00a0days). One Venusian year is about 1.92\u00a0Venusian solar days. To an observer on the surface of Venus, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east, although Venus's opaque clouds prevent observing the Sun from the planet's surface.\n", "BULLET::::- Venus passed between Earth and the star Regulus at 1428 GMT, providing astronomers an opportunity to learn more about the second planet. Because the starlight dimmed measurably as it passed through the Venusian atmosphere during the occultation, the density of that atmosphere could be calculated more precisely. The next conjunction of Venus and Regulus will take place on October 1, 2044.\n", "Venus rotates once every 243 Earth days\u2014by far the slowest rotation period of any known object in the Solar System. A Venusian sidereal day thus lasts more than a Venusian year (243 versus 224.7 Earth days). However, the length of a solar day on Venus is significantly shorter than the sidereal day; to an observer on the surface of Venus, the time from one sunrise to the next would be 116.75 days. Therefore, the slow Venerian rotation rate would result in extremely long days and nights, similar to the day-night cycles in the polar regions of earth \u2014 shorter, but global. The slow rotation might also account for the lack of a significant magnetic field.\n"], "__answers__": ["224.7 Earth days", "0.615 198 yr"]}}
