The bonds between these phosphate groups are high-energy bonds, particularly the bond between the second (\u03b2) and third (\u03b3) phosphate groups.\n\n2. **Hydrolysis Reaction**: The removal of a phosphate group from ATP occurs through a hydrolysis reaction. This process involves the breaking of the high-energy bond between the \u03b2 and \u03b3 phosphates, resulting in the release of energy that can be utilized by the cell for various biochemical processes.\n\n3. **Products of Hydrolysis**: When one phosphate group is removed from ATP, the products formed are adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and an inorganic phosphate (Pi). This reaction can be summarized as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{ADP} + \\text{Pi}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Energetic Implications**: The hydrolysis of ATP is an exergonic reaction, meaning it releases energy. This energy release is crucial for driving many cellular processes, including muscle contraction, active transport, and biosynthetic reactions.\n\n5. **Relevance in Biochemical Pathways**: Understanding the breakdown of ATP into ADP and Pi is essential for comprehending how energy is transferred and utilized in metabolic pathways. The conversion of ATP to ADP is a common step in many enzymatic reactions, highlighting ATP's role as an energy currency in the cell.\n\n6. **Linking to Enzymatic Reactions**: The knowledge of ATP hydrolysis can be linked to various enzymatic reactions where ATP is utilized, such as in the phosphorylation of substrates or in the activation of metabolic pathways. This understanding allows for predictions about how the availability of ATP affects cellular functions.\n\n### Answer:\nThe breakdown product formed when one phosphate group is removed from ATP is adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi).

The pyrophosphate, formed from the hydrolysis of the two high-energy bonds in ATP, is immediately hydrolyzed to two molecule of P by inorganic pyro phosphatase. This reaction is highly exergonic which drives the activation reaction forward and makes it more favorable. In the second step, the thiol group of a cytosolic coenzyme A attacks the acyl-adenylate, displacing AMP to form thioester fatty acyl-CoA.\\n', 'The enzyme splits pyruvate into carbon dioxide and a 2-carbon fragment which is attached to its cofactor TPP. This 2-carbon fragment is attached to the five membered TPP ring in its ylide form. This is an irreversible step in which it creates the acetaldehyde for the second step of alcoholic fermentation (anaerobic fermentation), in which acetaldehyde is reduced by NADH with alcohol dehydrogenase to ethanol.\\n', 'An example of this is glycogen breakdown by glycogen phosphorylase, which catalyzes attack by inorganic phosphate on the terminal glycosyl residue at the nonreducing end of a glycogen molecule. If the glycogen chain has \"n\" glucose units, the products of a single phosphorolytic event are one molecule of glucose 1-phosphate and a glycogen chain of \"n\"-1 remaining glucose units.\\n', 'In eukaryotes such as yeasts, plants and animals, the synthesis processes are believed to happen in mitochondria. The first step is the acylation of glycerol-3-phosphate by a glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase. Then acylglycerol-3-phosphate can be once more acylated to form a phosphatidic acid (PA). With the help of the enzyme CDP-DAG synthase (CDS) (phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase), PA is converted into cytidinediphosphate-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG). The following step is conversion of CDP-DAG to phosphatidylglycerol phosphate (PGP) by the enzyme PGP synthase, followed by dephosphorylation by PTPMT1 to form PG. Finally, a molecule of CDP-DAG is bound to PG to form one molecule of cardiolipin, catalyzed by the mitochondria-localized enzyme cardiolipin synthase (CLS).\\n', 'PTEs are responsible for the cleavage of the bond between the phosphorus atom and the leaving group.

A third enzyme, triokinase, is therefore required to phosphorylate glyceraldehyde, producing glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
