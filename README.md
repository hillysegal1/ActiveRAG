## Overview

ActiveRAG is designed to enhance traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models by introducing an active learning approach. Unlike conventional RAG systems that passively integrate retrieved information, ActiveRAG employs a multi-agent systemâ€”including Anchoring, Logician, Cognition, and Associate agentsâ€”that actively engages with external knowledge. This system allows the model to refine and link new information with its existing knowledge base, improving the quality and contextual relevance of generated responses.

Building on ActiveRAGâ€™s approach, our work specifically focuses on enhancing the Associate agent, which plays a crucial role in linking new data with the modelâ€™s existing knowledge. We ran ACTIVERAG using GPT-4.0 mini, rather than the original GPT-3.5 setup, to evaluate how prompt engineering techniques like contextual extraction and multi-perspective reasoning impact performance. We tested two modified prompts on the Natural Questions (NQ) and TriviaQA datasets, comparing ACTIVERAGâ€™s results with baseline models like Vanilla RAG, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and GPT-4 Turbo.

## Quick Start

### Install from git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenMatch/ActiveRAG
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Reproduction

We provide our request logs, so the results in the paper can be quickly reproduced:

```bash
python -m logs.eval --dataset nq --topk 5
```

**Parameters:**

- `dataset`: dataset name.
- `topk`: using top-k of retrieved passages to augment.

##  Re-request

We also provide the full request code, you can re-request for further exploration.

First, set your own api-key in agent file:

```python
openai.api_key = 'sk-<your-api-key>'
```

Then, run the following script:

```bash
python -m scripts.run --dataset nq --topk 5
```

Analyzing log files:

```bash
python -m scripts.build --dataset nq --topk 5
```

Evaluate:

```bash
python -m scripts.evaluate --dataset nq --topk 5
```
