The Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, and it represented a collective decision by the thirteen colonies to assert their independence from British rule. Each colony had its own delegates who participated in this significant event.\n\nFrom the retrieved knowledge, we know that Maryland had several key figures who signed the Declaration. The signers from Maryland include:\n\n1. **Samuel Chase**\n2. **William Paca**\n3. **Thomas Stone**\n4. **Charles Carroll of Carrollton**\n\n### Contextual Insights:\n- Maryland declared its independence from Britain in 1776, aligning with the broader movement across the colonies.\n- Charles Carroll of Carrollton was particularly notable as he was the only Roman Catholic to vote on independence and sign the document, highlighting the diversity of perspectives among the signers.\n- Carroll's wealth and status as one of the richest men in the Americas at the time underscore the personal stakes involved in the decision to support the revolution, as he risked significant personal loss.\n\n### Causal Relationships:\n- The act of signing the Declaration by these individuals directly contributed to Maryland's formal declaration of independence, which was a crucial step in the broader American Revolution.\n- Understanding the motivations of the signers, such as Carroll's wealth and religious background, allows us to infer that personal circumstances can significantly influence political decisions.\n\n### Connecting Events:\n- The signing of the Declaration is not an isolated event; it is part of a larger narrative that includes the ratification of the Articles of Confederation and the eventual adoption of the U.S. Constitution. Recognizing these connections helps us understand the sequence and interdependencies of historical events.\n\n### Evaluating Historical Impact:\n- The commitment of these signers to the cause of independence was pivotal in shaping the future of the United States. Their actions can be viewed as foundational to the establishment of a new government and the principles of democracy.\n\n### Logical Structuring:\n- By synthesizing this information, we can construct a coherent narrative that emphasizes the importance of the Declaration of Independence and the role of Maryland's signers in the larger context of American history. This structured approach enhances our ability to present logical arguments based on historical data.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy integrating the historical context, motivations, and implications of the actions of the Maryland signers, we can enhance our understanding of the causal relationships and logical inferences involved in this pivotal moment in American history.\n\n### Answer:\nCharles Carroll of Carrollton, Samuel Chase, William Paca, and Thomas Stone signed the Declaration of Independence for Maryland.
