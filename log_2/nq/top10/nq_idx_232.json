These changes reflect the ongoing development of the highway system and its adaptation to modern transportation needs.\n\nBy integrating this knowledge, the model can enhance its understanding of the Lincoln Highway's historical significance, geographical endpoints, and the changes it has undergone, thereby reducing the likelihood of inaccuracies or model illusions related to this topic.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe Lincoln Highway begins at the intersection of 42nd Street and Broadway in Times Square, New York City, and ends in Lincoln Park, San Francisco, California. It runs across various states, including a significant route through Indiana, where it follows current US Route 30. The highway has undergone various designations and realignments since its establishment in 1913, reflecting its historical importance and the evolution of road infrastructure in the United States."}], "question_info": {"question": "where does the lincoln highway begin and end", "passages": ["The Lincoln Highway was planned from Illinois state line to South Bend to Fort Wayne and the Ohio state line in 1913. In 1915, the highway opened and passed through downtown Fort Wayne on its route through Indiana. In 1917, Main Market route number 2 was the given number to the Lincoln Highway in Indiana. In the early 1920s, the Lincoln Highway was moved farther south between Valparaiso and Fort Wayne, to what is now known mostly as Old US\u00a030, passing through Plymouth and Warsaw. The route became SR\u00a02 from Ohio state line to South Bend, SR\u00a01 from South Bend to Michigan state line. Then in 1924, the sections of the road that was part of the original Lincoln Highway was paved. The next few years the rest of the route was paved across Indiana, then in 1937 US\u00a033 was created.\n", "The western end of the Lincoln Highway in Indiana was at the Illinois state line. The Lincoln Highway headed east passing through Dyer, still heading east the Lincoln Highway headed north around Schererville. Leaving US\u00a030 and heading east, running one mile north of US\u00a030, through Merrillville. East of Merrillville Lincoln Highway rejoins US\u00a030, before leaving US\u00a030 west of Valparaiso.\n", "Lincoln Highway in Indiana\n", "Nebraska Highway 31 is a highway in Nebraska. The southern terminus is near Louisville at an intersection with Nebraska Highway 50. The northern terminus is near Kennard at an intersection with U.S. Highway 30. The highway serves as a main north\u2013south highway in the western portion of the Omaha Metro Area.\n", "The Lincoln Highway was planned in 1913 to run west to east across Indiana, including to South Bend and Fort Wayne. In 1915, the highway opened and passed through downtown Fort Wayne on its route through Indiana, and was assigned the designation of Main Market route number 2 in 1917. Further designations saw the route become SR\u00a02 from the Illinois state line to Valparaiso, SR\u00a044 Valparaiso to Fort Wayne and SR\u00a02 from Fort Wayne to the Ohio state line. In the early 1920s, the Lincoln Highway was moved south between Valparaiso and Fort Wayne, to what is now known mostly as Old US\u00a030, passing through Plymouth and Warsaw. A section of US\u00a030 in Dyer known as the \"ideal section\" of the Lincoln Highway was opened in 1923 and rebuilt in the 1990s. In 1924, the sections of the road that were part of the original Lincoln Highway was paved, followed by the paving of the rest of US 30, which was commissioned in 1926. In 1927, a small realignment between Hanna and SR\u00a029 (current US\u00a035) took place. During the 1950s, US 30 in Fort Wayne was rerouted to Coliseum Boulevard, constructed as a \"circumurban\" highway to bypass Fort Wayne. But this \"circumurban\" route became an urban highway in its own right. In 1998, US\u00a030 in Fort Wayne was again rerouted onto I-69 and I-469, bypassing most of Fort Wayne and New Haven on the north and east side of the two towns. The Coliseum Boulevard routing was assigned the SR 930 designation as a result, when INDOT could not give the route over to local control.\n", "The Lincoln Highway was the first route to follow the corridor of US\u00a030 in Ohio. The Lincoln Highway was established in 1913, following the current route of SR\u00a0309 and SR\u00a081. Improvements and realignment to the highway were planned in 1917 and was to start in the spring of 1918. The route was built to relieve some of the railroad congestion. The Lincoln Highway realignment project was completed in 1939 and moved the Lincoln Highway to the modern US\u00a030 corridor. The Lincoln Highway in Ohio became known as SR\u00a05 between Indiana state line and Mansfield, SR\u00a010 between Mansfield and Wooster, and SR\u00a05 between Wooster and Pennsylvania. In 1925, the Federal Highway Association was established and one year later US\u00a030 was established. US\u00a030 followed the current route of SR\u00a0309. US\u00a030 eastern terminus in Ohio was relocated to the West Virginia state line, in 1928. The route became divided in 1932, with US\u00a030N taking the current alignment of US\u00a030 and US\u00a030S taking the current alignment of SR\u00a0309.\n", "This abandoned section of roadway was part of the original Lincoln Highway from 1913. It lies to the north of the Chicago Northwestern tracks which are immediately to the north of the Grand Junction Segment (see above). The Lincoln Highway route was moved north in eastern Greene County in 1914 so the Greene and Boone County segments of the highway would connect. The realignment also removed a couple of dangerous railroad crossings at the same time. This section of roadway survived that realignment, and remained part of the highway until 1922 when the right-of-way was shifted south of the railroad tracks and a new roadway was built. This realignment removed another railroad crossing at Grand Junction. There are three contributing resources to this historic district, two structures and one site. One of the structures is a concrete bridge that features concrete balustered guardrails. It was built by the Iowa Bridge Company in 1915 for $1,339. It replaced an older wooden span. A partially buried concrete driveway culvert is the other structure, and a section of the abandoned dirt roadway is the site. The roadway was never paved. The historic district is located on a farm and the former roadway and bridge are still used to move farm machinery.\n", "In 1913, the Lincoln Highway Association, headed by entrepreneur Carl G. Fisher, chose the intersection of 42nd Street and Broadway (at the southeast corner of Times Square) to be the Eastern Terminus of the Lincoln Highway. This was the first road across the United States, which originally spanned coast-to-coast through 13 states to its western terminus in Lincoln Park in San Francisco, California.\n", "As defined in 1913, the Lincoln Highway ran east-northeast from Canton, Ohio to Alliance and east via Salem, crossing into Pennsylvania just east of East Palestine. From there it continued southeasterly to Beaver, crossing the Beaver River there and heading south along its left bank to Rochester and the Ohio River's right bank to Pittsburgh.\n", "The Lincoln Highway entered Indiana on current US Route 30 to Fort Wayne. It turned northwest on modern U.S. Route 33 to Elkhart. It turned west on Lincoln Way through South Bend to U.S. Route 20. It followed US Route 20 to Rolling Prairie and continued on State Road 2 to Valparaiso where it rejoined US Route 30 to the Illinois state line.\n"], "__answers__": ["Lincoln Park in San Francisco", "Times Square in New York City", "from Times Square in New York City west to Lincoln Park in San Francisco"]}}
