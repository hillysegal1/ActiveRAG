Written on the tablets are the Ten Commandments as given at Mount Sinai encapsulating the basic tenets of Jewish faith and values. Each commandment is represented on the tablets by the first two words of the full commandment. Flames rise in the background of the tablets, symbolizing the burning bush or Mount Sinai aflame at the Giving of the Torah.\n", "The map has decorative enframes-cartouches on its sides, with two big cartouches at the top quadrants and two small ones at the bottom quadrants. The big cartouche at the top left shows the biblical Israeli leaders Moses and Aaron placing their hands on Israel's Tablets of the Law with the Ten Commandments inscribed in Hebrew. Above them at the top of the cartouche frame within another frame, appears a caption of the Hebrew word \"\u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05b9\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4\" - \"YHWH\", the tetragrammaton as the most sacred name of God. The big cartouche at the top right quadrant shows the biblical story of Adam and Eve in Paradise, which is based on Albrecht D\u00fcrer's engraving from 1504 under the title \"Adam and Eve\" - with small differences between the two. Above them at the top of the cartouche frame within another frame, appears a caption of the Hebrew word \"\u05d0\u05b1\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd\" - \"Elohim\" as the second name of God. The small cartouche at the bottom left quadrant shows a heraldic eagle and an inscription to sir Robert Cotton who encouraged Speed to start drawing maps.\n", "The Master of the Altarpiece of the Ten Commandments () was a German painter active in the region of G\u00f6ttingen at the beginning of the fifteenth century. His name is derived from a portable altarpiece, depicting the Ten Commandments, which is believed to have at one time stood in the chapel of the Sacred Heart in G\u00f6ttingen, constructed in 1319. Only the central part of the painting survives, today in the history museum in Hannover; it depicts six scenes in two registers, showing the second, third, fourth, seventh, eight, and ninth Commandments. The wings, illustrating the other four, are now lost. At the top of the composition is a half-length figure of Christ holding a scroll on which are inscribed the Commandments.\n", "The plurality opinion stated that the monument was constitutional, as it represented historical value and not purely religious value. The primary content is the text of the Ten Commandments. An eagle grasping the American flag, an eye inside of a pyramid, and two small tablets with what appears to be an ancient script are carved above the text of the Ten Commandments. Below the text are two Stars of David and the superimposed Greek letters Chi and Rho, which represent Christ. The bottom of the monument bears the inscription \"PRESENTED TO THE PEOPLE AND YOUTH OF TEXAS BY THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF EAGLES OF TEXAS 1961.\"\n", "Alter wrote that the instruction of to place the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments in the Tabernacle reflected a common ancient Near Eastern practice of placing documents of solemn contracts within sacred precincts.\n", "The order of the letters of the alphabet is attested from the fourteenth century BCE in the town of Ugarit on Syria's northern coast. Tablets found there bear over one thousand cuneiform signs, but these signs are not Babylonian and there are only thirty distinct characters. About twelve of the tablets have the signs set out in alphabetic order. There are two orders found, one of which is nearly identical to the order used for Hebrew, Greek and Latin, and a second order very similar to that used for Ethiopian.\n", "According to the Hebrew Bible, the Tables of the Law as they are widely known in English, or Tablets of Stone, Stone Tablets, or Tablets of Testimony (in Hebrew: \u05dc\u05d5\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea \"Luchot HaBrit\" - \"the tablets [of] the covenant\") in the Exodus 34:1, were the two pieces of stone inscribed with the Ten Commandments when Moses ascended Mount Sinai as written in the Book of Exodus. Exodus 31:18 refers to the tablets as the \"Tablets of (the) Testimony\".\n", "Sometime in the distant past, God dictated the angel scribe Metatron to write a compendium of tablets known as the Word of God. They cover a variety of subjects, including demons, angels, and leviathans. God then sealed the tablets inside the \"Vault of the Earth\" and even if someone were to find them, only a few chosen humans, the prophets, are able to decipher them. The Leviathan Tablet, which was dug from somewhere in Iran, has an instruction regarding how to kill a leviathan. The Demon Tablet, recovered by Crowley through unknown means, contains an instruction about locking all demons in Hell forever as well as techniques about disposing demons, such as devil's traps, holy water, and demon bombs. The Angel Tablet, stored in one of Lucifer's crypts, has the information on how to make all angels fall from Heaven as well as an incantation to imbue an angel with great power. The Demon Tablet is currently in the possession of Castiel, who has destroyed the Angel Tablet in the ninth season to prevent Metatron from using its powers.\n", "The arrangement of the commandments on the two tablets is interpreted in different ways in the classical Jewish tradition. Rabbi Hanina ben Gamaliel says that each tablet contained five commandments, \"but the Sages say ten on one tablet and ten on the other\", that is, that the tablets were duplicates. This can be compared to diplomatic treaties of the ancient Near East, in which a copy was made for each party.\n", "The Jewish Chaplain insignia made up of two tablets of the Ten Commandments, with ten Roman numerals symbolizing the commandments, and with the six-pointed Star of David above the tablets, was adopted for Jewish army chaplains in 1917, and for Jewish naval chaplains in 1941. The original Army description did not specifically reference a star \"per se\", but instead read \"a double Tablet bearing numerals from I to X, surmounted by two equilateral Triangles interlaced.\"\n"], "__answers__": ["Ark of the Covenant", "in the Ark of the Covenant"]}}
