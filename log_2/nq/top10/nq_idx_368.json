The German Egyptologist Hartwig Altenm\u00fcller writes that for an Egyptian of the time \"the [...] afterlife no longer depends on the relationship between the individual mortal and the king, [...] instead it is linked to his ethical position in direct relation to Osiris\". In contrast, the cult of the sun god Ra was in apparent decline, even though Ra was still the most important deity of the Egyptian pantheon. Thus, Djedkare Isesi and Unas did not build a sun temple in contrast with most of their Fifth Dynasty predecessors. In addition, the names of Menkauhor Kaiu and Unas do not incorporate any reference to Ra, in rupture with a tradition which held since the reign of Userkaf, about a century earlier. The \"Pyramid Texts\" found in Unas\\' pyramid demonstrate the importance of Osiris and Ra in ancient Egyptian religion at the time. Both gods were believed to play the key roles in accessing the afterlife, with Ra as the source of life and Osiris as the force through which the next life would be attained.\\n', \"With greater power and wealth during the New Kingdom (c. 1550\u20131070\\xa0BC), Egypt devoted still more resources to its temples, which grew larger and more elaborate. Higher-ranking priestly roles became permanent rather than rotating positions, and they controlled a large portion of Egypt's wealth. Anthony Spalinger suggests that, as the influence of temples expanded, religious celebrations that had once been fully public were absorbed into the temples' increasingly important festival rituals. The most important god of the time was Amun, whose main cult center, the Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak in Thebes, eventually became the largest of all temples, and whose high priests may have wielded considerable political influence.\\n\", 'During this dynasty, Egyptian religion made several important changes. The earliest known copies of funerary prayers inscribed on royal tombs (known as the Pyramid Texts) appear. The cult of the god Ra gains added importance, and kings from Userkaf through Menkauhor Kaiu built temples dedicated to Ra at or near Abusir. Then late in this dynasty, the cult of the deity Osiris assumes importance, most notably in the inscriptions found in the tomb of Unas.\\n', \"The Middle Kingdom crumbled in the Second Intermediate Period (c. 1650\u20131550 BC), but the country was again reunited by Theban rulers, who became the first pharaohs of the New Kingdom. Under the new regime, Amun became the supreme state god. He was syncretized with Ra, the long-established patron of kingship, and his temple at Karnak in Thebes became Egypt's most important religious center.

At Koptos, the Coptos Decree was found on a stela which referred to the actions of Nubkheperre Intef against Teti, son of Minhotep. At Abydos, several stone fragments were found, including columns which attest to some kind of restoration work. On a stela found at Abydos, a mention is made of a \"House of Intef\".

His main cult center, the Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak, became the largest temple complex in Egypt, symbolizing the centralization of worship and the intertwining of religion and state power. This elevation of Amun reflects a shift in religious practices, where the focus moved towards a singular, powerful deity.\n\n2. **Syncretism with Ra**: Amun's syncretism with Ra, the sun god, illustrates the fluidity of Egyptian theology. This merging not only highlights the importance of solar worship but also signifies the evolving nature of kingship and divine authority. Amun's association with Ra allowed him to embody both the political and spiritual aspirations of the pharaohs, reinforcing his status as a central figure in Egyptian religion.\n\n3. **Influence of the Priesthood**: The New Kingdom saw the rise of a powerful and professional priesthood that controlled vast resources and wealth. The establishment of permanent high-ranking priestly roles marked a shift towards institutionalized religion, where priests became key intermediaries between the gods and the people. This development had significant implications for the governance of religious practices and the relationship between the state and religion.\n\n4. **Cult of Osiris**: The cult of Osiris gained prominence during this period, particularly concerning beliefs about the afterlife and individual morality. Osiris became a crucial figure in the belief system surrounding death and resurrection, contrasting with earlier notions that emphasized the king's role in the afterlife. This shift towards a more democratized religious belief system allowed individuals to engage with their spirituality on a personal level, emphasizing ethical behavior as essential for attaining the afterlife.\n\n5. **Decline of Ra's Influence**: Although Ra remained an important deity, his influence waned in favor of Amun and Osiris.

His syncretization with Ra and the establishment of the Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak as the largest temple complex highlight his elevated status. The increasing power of the priesthood associated with Amun also suggests that he was not only a religious figure but also a political one, influencing the governance of Egypt.\n\n**Expert 2: The Role of Osiris**\nWhile I acknowledge Amun's importance, I believe that Osiris played a crucial role in shaping the religious landscape of the New Kingdom, particularly concerning the afterlife. The passages indicate a shift in focus from the pharaoh as the guarantor of the afterlife to Osiris, who became central to individual ethical considerations regarding the afterlife. This transition reflects a significant change in the Egyptian worldview, emphasizing personal morality over royal lineage.\n\n**Expert 3: The Decline of Ra**\nI would like to add that while Ra was historically significant, his influence appeared to wane during the New Kingdom, as indicated in the passages. The lack of sun temples built by later pharaohs and the absence of Ra's name in royal titles suggest a decline in his prominence. This shift further underscores the rise of Amun and Osiris, as they took on roles that were previously dominated by Ra.\n\n**Expert 4: The Political Context**\nI agree with the points made about Amun and Osiris, but I think it\u2019s essential to consider the political context of the New Kingdom. The expulsion of the Hyksos and the establishment of Thebes as a capital city elevated Amun's status as the local deity to a national one. This political backdrop facilitated Amun's rise and the consolidation of religious power within the priesthood, which had lasting implications for Egyptian society.\n\n**Expert 5: The Evolution of Religious Thought**\nI would like to emphasize the evolution of religious thought during this period. The emergence of the Pyramid Texts and the increasing complexity of theological discussions reflect a broader intellectual engagement with the divine. This evolution allowed for the integration of various deities, including Amun and Osiris, into a more cohesive religious framework that addressed both personal and communal needs.\n\n**Synthesis of Insights**\nThe discussion reveals a multifaceted understanding of the most important religious figure in the New Kingdom of ancient Egypt. Amun's rise to prominence is supported by his political significance and the consolidation of temple wealth and power. However, the importance of Osiris in the context of personal morality and the afterlife cannot be overlooked, as it represents a significant shift in religious thought. The decline of Ra illustrates the dynamic nature of Egyptian religion, where the roles of deities evolved in response to changing societal values and political contexts.\n\nIn summary, while Amun may be seen as the most important religious figure due to his political and religious influence, Osiris's role in shaping beliefs about the afterlife and personal ethics is equally significant.

The discussion among experts highlights several key figures and their roles, particularly Amun, Osiris, and the controversial Akhenaten.\n\n1. **Amun's Prominence**: Expert 1 emphasizes Amun's ascendance as the supreme deity during the New Kingdom, particularly through his syncretization with Ra and the establishment of the grand temple complex at Karnak. Amun's influence extended beyond religion into the political realm, as the priesthood gained substantial power and wealth, shaping governance in Egypt.\n\n2. **Osiris's Role**: Expert 2 presents Osiris as a pivotal figure, especially concerning beliefs about the afterlife. The transition from a focus on the pharaoh's role in the afterlife to Osiris's ethical considerations marks a significant evolution in Egyptian spirituality. This shift highlights the growing importance of individual morality in religious practice.\n\n3. **Decline of Ra**: Expert 3 notes that while Ra was historically significant, his influence diminished during the New Kingdom. The lack of new temples dedicated to Ra and the absence of his name in royal titles suggest a shift in worship towards Amun and Osiris, indicating a dynamic religious landscape.\n\n4. **Political Context**: Expert 4 contextualizes the rise of Amun within the political landscape, particularly following the expulsion of the Hyksos. The establishment of Thebes as the capital and Amun's local patronage elevated his status to a national level, reinforcing the connection between political power and religious authority.\n\n5. **Evolution of Religious Thought**: Expert 5 highlights the broader intellectual engagement with the divine during this period, as seen in the emergence of the Pyramid Texts and complex theological discussions. This evolution allowed for a more integrated understanding of various deities, including Amun and Osiris, reflecting the changing needs of society.\n\nThe discussion reveals a nuanced understanding of the religious figures of the New Kingdom. While Amun is often regarded as the most important due to his political and religious influence, Osiris's role in shaping beliefs about the afterlife and personal ethics is equally significant. The decline of Ra illustrates the fluidity of religious practices and beliefs, responding to societal changes.\n\n**Conclusion**: Based on the enriched synthesis of expert insights, Amun emerges as the most important religious figure of the New Kingdom due to his central role in both religion and politics. However, Osiris's significance in the context of individual morality and the afterlife cannot be overlooked. The interplay between these deities reflects the complexity of ancient Egyptian religion and its responsiveness to the evolving needs of its people.\n\n**Answer**: Amun, as the supreme deity and a central figure in both religious and political life, is considered the most important religious figure of the New Kingdom of ancient Egypt, though Osiris's role in personal ethics and the afterlife is also significant."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nwhat was the most important new religious figure of the new kingdom of ancient egypt\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['Meanwhile, the cult of Osiris was becoming more important with this god replacing the king as the guarantor of life after death for the pharaoh\\'s subjects. The German Egyptologist Hartwig Altenm\u00fcller writes that for an Egyptian of the time \"the [...] afterlife no longer depends on the relationship between the individual mortal and the king, [...] instead it is linked to his ethical position in direct relation to Osiris\". In contrast, the cult of the sun god Ra was in apparent decline, even though Ra was still the most important deity of the Egyptian pantheon. Thus, Djedkare Isesi and Unas did not build a sun temple in contrast with most of their Fifth Dynasty predecessors. In addition, the names of Menkauhor Kaiu and Unas do not incorporate any reference to Ra, in rupture with a tradition which held since the reign of Userkaf, about a century earlier. The \"Pyramid Texts\" found in Unas\\' pyramid demonstrate the importance of Osiris and Ra in ancient Egyptian religion at the time. Both gods were believed to play the key roles in accessing the afterlife, with Ra as the source of life and Osiris as the force through which the next life would be attained.\\n', \"With greater power and wealth during the New Kingdom (c. 1550\u20131070\\xa0BC), Egypt devoted still more resources to its temples, which grew larger and more elaborate. Higher-ranking priestly roles became permanent rather than rotating positions, and they controlled a large portion of Egypt's wealth. Anthony Spalinger suggests that, as the influence of temples expanded, religious celebrations that had once been fully public were absorbed into the temples' increasingly important festival rituals. The most important god of the time was Amun, whose main cult center, the Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak in Thebes, eventually became the largest of all temples, and whose high priests may have wielded considerable political influence.\\n\", 'During this dynasty, Egyptian religion made several important changes. The earliest known copies of funerary prayers inscribed on royal tombs (known as the Pyramid Texts) appear. The cult of the god Ra gains added importance, and kings from Userkaf through Menkauhor Kaiu built temples dedicated to Ra at or near Abusir. Then late in this dynasty, the cult of the deity Osiris assumes importance, most notably in the inscriptions found in the tomb of Unas.\\n', \"The Middle Kingdom crumbled in the Second Intermediate Period (c. 1650\u20131550 BC), but the country was again reunited by Theban rulers, who became the first pharaohs of the New Kingdom. Under the new regime, Amun became the supreme state god. He was syncretized with Ra, the long-established patron of kingship, and his temple at Karnak in Thebes became Egypt's most important religious center. Amun's elevation was partly due to the great importance of Thebes, but it was also due to the increasingly professional priesthood.

At Koptos, the Coptos Decree was found on a stela which referred to the actions of Nubkheperre Intef against Teti, son of Minhotep. At Abydos, several stone fragments were found, including columns which attest to some kind of restoration work. On a stela found at Abydos, a mention is made of a \"House of Intef\". This most likely refers to a building belonging to Nubkheperre Intef. Therefore, while Nubkheperre Intef\\'s highest\u2014and only known\u2014year date is his Year 3 on the Koptos stela, this must be considered an underestimate since he must have ruled much longer to accomplish his ambitious building program and also complete his royal tomb.

Horus was the most important god in the Early Dynastic Period, Ra rose to preeminence in the Old Kingdom, Amun was supreme in the New, and in the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, Isis was the divine queen and creator goddess.

Akhenaten's reforms led to the establishment of a new capital, Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna), and he is often considered a pivotal figure in the history of religion due to his attempts to reshape the spiritual beliefs of his society.\n\nAnswer: Akhenaten.\nTo update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions. \nI retrieved some knowledge that may update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions\nNote that these passages are retrieved from the most authoritative knowledge repositories, so they are assumed to be correct.\nknowledge:\nBased on the provided passages, the following points can be extracted that may update the model's knowledge regarding the most important religious figure of the New Kingdom of ancient Egypt:\n\n1. **Amun's Supremacy**: The passages indicate that during the New Kingdom (c. 1550\u20131070 BC), Amun became the supreme state god, particularly after the reunification of Egypt by Theban rulers. His temple at Karnak in Thebes grew to be the largest religious center, and the high priests of Amun wielded considerable political influence. This suggests that Amun was the most important religious figure during this period, which may not be fully represented in the model's existing knowledge.\n\n2. **Syncretism with Ra**: The passages mention that Amun was syncretized with Ra, the long-established patron of kingship. This syncretism highlights the evolving nature of religious beliefs in ancient Egypt and the importance of Amun in relation to Ra, which could be a nuance that the model might not have captured adequately.\n\n3. **Decline of Ra's Cult**: While Ra was historically significant, the passages suggest that his cult was in apparent decline during the New Kingdom, contrasting with the rise of Amun's importance. This shift in religious focus could be an important update to the model's understanding of the religious landscape of ancient Egypt during this time.\n\n4. **Role of Temples and Priesthood**: The expansion of temple resources and the establishment of permanent higher-ranking priestly roles indicate a significant change in the religious structure of ancient Egypt. This information could enhance the model's understanding of how religious authority and influence were organized during the New Kingdom.\n\n5. **Cults of Osiris and Ra**: The passages also mention the growing importance of the cult of Osiris, especially in the context of the afterlife. While Amun was the supreme god, Osiris played a crucial role in the religious beliefs surrounding death and the afterlife, which could be an important aspect of the religious hierarchy that the model should consider.\n\nIn summary, the model's knowledge could be updated to reflect that Amun was the most important religious figure during the New Kingdom, with significant syncretism with Ra, a decline in Ra's cult, and the rising importance of Osiris in the context of the afterlife. Additionally, the evolving structure of religious authority through temples and priesthoods is a critical aspect of this period that should be integrated into the model's understanding.\nPlease verify the above reasoning process for errors, \nthen enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to update the language model's knowledge, prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions.\nAfterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n\nGeneration Format:\nknowledge enhanced inference process:\nAnswer:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Knowledge Enhanced Inference Process:**\n\nThe New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt (c. 1550\u20131070 BCE) was a transformative period in the religious landscape of the civilization. While Akhenaten is often highlighted for his introduction of the worship of Aten as a sole deity, this monotheistic shift was relatively short-lived and did not represent the broader religious practices of the New Kingdom as a whole.\n\n1. **Amun's Supremacy**: During the New Kingdom, Amun emerged as the supreme state god, particularly after the reunification of Egypt by Theban rulers. His temple at Karnak became the largest religious center, and the high priests of Amun gained significant political power. This suggests that Amun was the most important religious figure during this period, overshadowing Akhenaten's reforms.\n\n2. **Syncretism with Ra**: Amun was syncretized with Ra, the traditional sun god, indicating a blending of religious beliefs that further solidified Amun's position. This syncretism reflects the evolving nature of Egyptian religion and the importance of Amun in relation to Ra, which is a critical aspect that should be emphasized.\n\n3. **Decline of Ra's Cult**: Although Ra was historically significant, his cult experienced a decline during the New Kingdom, contrasting with the rise of Amun's importance. This shift is essential for understanding the religious dynamics of the time.\n\n4. **Role of Temples and Priesthood**: The New Kingdom saw the expansion of temple resources and the establishment of permanent higher-ranking priestly roles, indicating a significant change in the religious structure. This development highlights the growing influence of religious institutions and their leaders.\n\n5. **Cults of Osiris and Afterlife Beliefs**: The cult of Osiris gained prominence during this period, particularly concerning beliefs about the afterlife. While Amun was the supreme god, Osiris played a crucial role in the religious beliefs surrounding death and resurrection, which is an important aspect of the religious hierarchy.\n\nIn summary, while Akhenaten's introduction of Aten was a notable event, Amun's supremacy and the significance of the cults of Ra and Osiris are critical to understanding the religious landscape of the New Kingdom. Amun's role as the most important religious figure, along with the evolving structure of religious authority, should be emphasized in the model's knowledge.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe most important religious figure of the New Kingdom of ancient Egypt was Amun, who became the supreme state god during this period. His temple at Karnak in Thebes was the largest religious center, and the high priests of Amun wielded considerable political influence. While Akhenaten introduced the worship of Aten as a sole deity, this monotheistic approach was short-lived, and Amun's prominence, along with the growing cult of Osiris, played a more significant role in the religious practices of the time."}], "question_info": {"question": "what was the most important new religious figure of the new kingdom of ancient egypt", "passages": ["Meanwhile, the cult of Osiris was becoming more important with this god replacing the king as the guarantor of life after death for the pharaoh's subjects. The German Egyptologist Hartwig Altenm\u00fcller writes that for an Egyptian of the time \"the [...] afterlife no longer depends on the relationship between the individual mortal and the king, [...] instead it is linked to his ethical position in direct relation to Osiris\". In contrast, the cult of the sun god Ra was in apparent decline, even though Ra was still the most important deity of the Egyptian pantheon. Thus, Djedkare Isesi and Unas did not build a sun temple in contrast with most of their Fifth Dynasty predecessors. In addition, the names of Menkauhor Kaiu and Unas do not incorporate any reference to Ra, in rupture with a tradition which held since the reign of Userkaf, about a century earlier. The \"Pyramid Texts\" found in Unas' pyramid demonstrate the importance of Osiris and Ra in ancient Egyptian religion at the time. Both gods were believed to play the key roles in accessing the afterlife, with Ra as the source of life and Osiris as the force through which the next life would be attained.\n", "With greater power and wealth during the New Kingdom (c. 1550\u20131070\u00a0BC), Egypt devoted still more resources to its temples, which grew larger and more elaborate. Higher-ranking priestly roles became permanent rather than rotating positions, and they controlled a large portion of Egypt's wealth. Anthony Spalinger suggests that, as the influence of temples expanded, religious celebrations that had once been fully public were absorbed into the temples' increasingly important festival rituals. The most important god of the time was Amun, whose main cult center, the Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak in Thebes, eventually became the largest of all temples, and whose high priests may have wielded considerable political influence.\n", "During this dynasty, Egyptian religion made several important changes. The earliest known copies of funerary prayers inscribed on royal tombs (known as the Pyramid Texts) appear. The cult of the god Ra gains added importance, and kings from Userkaf through Menkauhor Kaiu built temples dedicated to Ra at or near Abusir. Then late in this dynasty, the cult of the deity Osiris assumes importance, most notably in the inscriptions found in the tomb of Unas.\n", "The Middle Kingdom crumbled in the Second Intermediate Period (c. 1650\u20131550 BC), but the country was again reunited by Theban rulers, who became the first pharaohs of the New Kingdom. Under the new regime, Amun became the supreme state god. He was syncretized with Ra, the long-established patron of kingship, and his temple at Karnak in Thebes became Egypt's most important religious center. Amun's elevation was partly due to the great importance of Thebes, but it was also due to the increasingly professional priesthood. Their sophisticated theological discussion produced detailed descriptions of Amun's universal power.\n", "After the 1453 fall of Constantinople, when the Sultan replaced \"de jure\" the Byzantine emperor for subjugated Christians, he recognized the Ecumenical Patriarch as the religious and national leader (\"ethnarch\") of the Greeks and other ethnic groups in the Greek Orthodox \"Millet\". The Patriarchate had primary importance, occupying this key role for Christians of the Empire because the Ottomans did not legally distinguish between nationality and religion and considered the empire's Orthodox Christians a single entity.\n", "Nubkheperre Intef is one of the best attested kings of the 17th dynasty who restored numerous damaged temples in Upper Egypt as well as constructing a new temple at Gebel Antef. The best preserved building from his reign is the remains of a small chapel at Koptos. Four walls that have been reconstructed show the king in front of Min and show him crowned by Horus and by another god. The reliefs are executed in raised and sunken relief. At Koptos, the Coptos Decree was found on a stela which referred to the actions of Nubkheperre Intef against Teti, son of Minhotep. At Abydos, several stone fragments were found, including columns which attest to some kind of restoration work. On a stela found at Abydos, a mention is made of a \"House of Intef\". This most likely refers to a building belonging to Nubkheperre Intef. Therefore, while Nubkheperre Intef's highest\u2014and only known\u2014year date is his Year 3 on the Koptos stela, this must be considered an underestimate since he must have ruled much longer to accomplish his ambitious building program and also complete his royal tomb. Indeed, Nubkheperre Intef is alone \"mentioned on over twenty contemporary monuments\" from his reign which demonstrates his position as one of the most powerful rulers of the Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt.\n", "This divine assemblage had a vague and changeable hierarchy. Gods with broad influence in the cosmos or who were mythologically older than others had higher positions in divine society. At the apex of this society was the king of the gods, who was usually identified with the creator deity. In different periods of Egyptian history, different gods were most frequently said to hold this exalted position. Horus was the most important god in the Early Dynastic Period, Ra rose to preeminence in the Old Kingdom, Amun was supreme in the New, and in the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, Isis was the divine queen and creator goddess. Newly prominent gods tended to adopt characteristics from their predecessors. Isis absorbed the traits of many other goddesses during her rise, and when Amun became the ruler of the pantheon, he was conjoined with Ra to become a solar deity.\n", "Senusret I dispatched several quarrying expeditions to the Sinai and Wadi Hammamat and built numerous shrines and temples throughout Egypt and Nubia during his long reign. He rebuilt the important temple of Re-Atum in Heliopolis which was the centre of the sun cult. He erected 2 red granite obelisks there to celebrate his Year 30 Heb Sed Jubilee. One of the obelisks still remains and is the oldest standing obelisk in Egypt. It is now in the Al-Masalla (Obelisk in Arabic) area of Al-Matariyyah district near the Ain Shams district (Heliopolis). It is 67 feet tall and weighs 120 tons or 240,000 pounds.\n", "When the army of the founder of the Eighteenth Dynasty expelled the Hyksos rulers from Egypt, the victor's city of origin, Thebes, became the most important city in Egypt, the capital of a new dynasty. The local patron deity of Thebes, Amun, therefore became nationally important. The pharaohs of that new dynasty attributed all of their successes to Amun, and they lavished much of their wealth and captured spoil on the construction of temples dedicated to Amun.\n", "After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, when the Sultan virtually replaced the Byzantine emperor among subjugated Christians, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople was recognized by the Sultan as the religious and national leader (\"ethnarch\") of Greeks and the other ethnicities that were included in the Greek Orthodox \"Millet\". The Patriarchate earned a primary importance and occupied this key role among the Christians of the Ottoman Empire because the Ottomans did not legally distinguish between nationality and religion, and thus regarded all the Orthodox Christians of the Empire as a single entity.\n"], "__answers__": ["Aten", "the Aten , a representation of the Egyptian god , Ra"]}}
