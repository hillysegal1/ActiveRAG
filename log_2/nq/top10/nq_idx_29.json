This was primarily driven by high copper prices, which made aluminum a more economical choice for builders. However, the properties of aluminum, including its susceptibility to oxidation and poor connections, led to significant safety concerns.\n\n2. **Safety Concerns**: Experts highlighted that the electrical devices of the time were not designed to accommodate aluminum wiring, which increased the risk of electrical fires. This critical safety issue was a major factor in the eventual decline of aluminum wiring usage.\n\n3. **Regulatory Changes**: The Ontario Electrical Safety Code (OESC) plays a pivotal role in governing electrical installations. As safety issues became more apparent, the OESC underwent revisions, particularly in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The 1978 revision specifically addressed the problems associated with aluminum wiring, leading to stricter regulations and a significant reduction in its use in new constructions.\n\n4. **Economic Factors**: The economic perspective adds depth to the discussion, noting that the shift back to copper wiring was not only a response to safety concerns but also influenced by market dynamics. As copper prices stabilized, builders found it more viable to use copper, which is generally regarded as a safer and more reliable material.\n\n5. **Contemporary Implications**: The legacy of aluminum wiring remains relevant today, as many homes built during the aluminum era still exist. Current homeowners must be aware of the potential fire hazards associated with older aluminum wiring installations. This necessitates ongoing education and regulatory oversight to ensure safety in existing homes.\n\n6. **Synthesis of Perspectives**: The integration of historical, safety, regulatory, economic, and contemporary perspectives provides a comprehensive understanding of the decline of aluminum wiring in Ontario. Each perspective contributes to a fuller picture of the factors that led to the phasing out of aluminum wiring, emphasizing the importance of safety and regulatory compliance in electrical installations.\n\n**Answer**: \nAluminum wiring was largely phased out in Ontario by the early 1980s due to significant safety concerns and subsequent changes in the Ontario Electrical Safety Code. The use of aluminum wiring was prevalent from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s, driven by high copper prices. However, safety issues related to poor connections and increased fire risks prompted regulatory revisions in the late 1970s, leading to a decline in its use in new residential construction.

Carlton Trail continues to repair cars that have been damaged during derailments along their line. In recent years, larger shortline railways have removed oddball motive power, such as ALCO and MLW units from their roster; as such Carlton Trail now strictly operates used EMD units that they have purchased. Currently the only operational engines are three GP10s that run between Saskatoon & Prince Albert.\n", "Aluminum also became popular. In 1902, attracted by the availability of cheap hydro power, the Aluminum Company of America established a Canadian subsidiary, the Northern Aluminum Company (Alcan) at Shawinigan Falls, Quebec to produce that metal using the electrolysis technique. Corporate changes led to the creation of the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan) in 1925 and in 1926 the company constructed a giant aluminum smelter at a place it named Arvida, Quebec. Once again the site was chosen for the availability of cheap hydro electricity and the proximity of a deep-water port at Bagotville for large ships carrying bauxite or aluminum ore. World War II accelerated the demand for aluminum, which was the principal material in aircraft production and the Arvida facility was greatly expanded. In 1958 another huge Alcan smelter was built at Kitimat, British Columbia.\n"], "__answers__": ["mid-1970s"]}}
