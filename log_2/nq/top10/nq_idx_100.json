Pervukhin discussed other problems as well, claiming that Ulbricht but also the East German leadership in general, were opposed to the Soviet Union\\'s plan to improve relations with West Germany. When Khrushchev gave his approval to construct what would become the Berlin Wall, Pervukhin was the first to know. Ulbricht told Pervukhin of the need to create the East\u2013West barrier at night, and he and Khrushchev would later agree to this.\\n', 'In 1975 he was sent back to Berlin where he served a second stint as Soviet ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, remaining in post this time till 1983. His years as ambassador were not without Soviet-East German tensions. During the early 1960s the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev was interested in exploring a less confrontational relationship with the west while the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht, remained uncompromisingly hard-line in his attitude to the west in general and in his country\\'s relationship with West Germany specifically. The decision suddenly to erect the Berlin Wall in August 1961 was naturally taken by the East Germans in full consultation with the Soviet ambassador. From the East German perspective The Wall represented a necessary desperate attempt to save the state which appeared to be in the process of losing its entire working age population. With Abrassimov as Soviet ambassador in Berlin, Walter Ulbricht, who had earlier enjoyed close relations with Soviet leader Josef Stalin, found he enjoyed far less direct contact with the Soviet leadership in Moscow. In 1963/64, when Ulbricht moved to control air traffic flying into West Berlin, it was Abrassimov who prevented the move. He actively opposed East German reluctance to conclude a belated post war peace treaty with West Germany, and in 1966 set up direct links with Willy Brandt, then the mayor of West Berlin, without telling the leadership of the East German ruling SED (party). Abrassimov also participated regularly in meetings of the East German cabinet, something which had never happened when Mikhail Pervukhin was the Soviet ambassador. The relationship between the Soviet ambassador and the East German leadership did not improve with the appointment of a new East German leader, Erich Honecker, in 1971. During the 1980s Abrassimov\\'s growing propensity to meet regularly with western ambassadors to Berlin without reference to his East German host government did not help matters. In 1983 he was seen to be becoming ever more paternalistic and autocratic in his ambassadorial office, and following the death of Leonid Brezhnev at the end of 1982, Honecker managed to persuade Moscow to replace Abrassimov because of the extent of his \"interference in East German domestic politics\".\\n', 'Walter Ulbricht (1893\u20131973) was the party boss from 1950 to 1971. In 1933, Ulbricht had fled to Moscow, where he served as a Comintern agent loyal to Stalin. As World War II was ending, Stalin assigned him the job of designing the postwar German system that would centralize all power in the Communist Party. Ulbricht became deputy prime minister in 1949 and secretary (chief executive) of the Socialist Unity (Communist) party in 1950. Some 2.6 million people had fled East Germany by 1961 when he built the Berlin Wall to stop them \u2014 shooting those who attempted it. What the GDR called the \"Anti-Fascist Protective Wall\" was a major embarrassment for the program during the Cold War, but it did stabilize East Germany and postpone its collapse. Ulbricht lost power in 1971, but was kept on as a nominal head of state. He was replaced because he failed to solve growing national crises, such as the worsening economy in 1969\u201370, the fear of another popular uprising as had occurred in 1953, and the disgruntlement between Moscow and Berlin caused by Ulbricht\\'s d\u00e9tente policies toward the West.\\n', \"After World War II, Germans tended to prefer living in West Germany over East Germany, and Berlin became a major escape route for people wanting to leave the Soviet sphere of influence for the West.

The key figure in the Soviet Union during this time was Nikita Khrushchev, who served as the General Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 until 1964. \n\n1. **Khrushchev's Leadership**: \n   - Khrushchev's leadership was marked by significant events in the Cold War, including the construction of the Berlin Wall. His approval was crucial for East German leader Walter Ulbricht to proceed with the Wall's construction, indicating a strong influence of Soviet leadership over Eastern Bloc countries.\n\n2. **Context of the Berlin Wall's Construction**:\n   - The Berlin Wall was erected in response to a crisis in East Germany, where a significant number of citizens were fleeing to West Germany. This mass emigration threatened the stability of the East German state, prompting Ulbricht to seek Khrushchev's approval for the Wall as a means to prevent further loss of population.\n\n3. **Geopolitical Implications**:\n   - The construction of the Wall symbolized the broader ideological divide between the East and West during the Cold War. It was not just a physical barrier but also a representation of the Soviet Union's efforts to maintain control over Eastern Europe and prevent the spread of Western influence.\n\n4. **Ulbricht's Role**:\n   - Walter Ulbricht, as the leader of East Germany, played a pivotal role in the decision to build the Wall. His hard-line stance against the West and the need to stabilize East Germany were significant factors in the Wall's construction. Khrushchev's support was essential for Ulbricht to implement this drastic measure.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the above reasoning, it is clear that Nikita Khrushchev was the leader of the Soviet Union when the Berlin Wall was built.

It was during the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev that the wall was erected. Khrushchev's approval was crucial, as he was the Soviet leader who agreed to East German leader Walter Ulbricht's request to build the wall in response to the mass emigration from East to West Germany. This decision was rooted in the broader context of the Cold War, where the Soviet Union sought to maintain its influence over Eastern Europe and prevent the collapse of the East German state.\n\n**Expert 2: Political Dynamics Analyst**\nWhile I agree with the historical context provided, I would like to emphasize the political dynamics at play. Khrushchev's leadership was characterized by a mix of aggression and attempts at d\u00e9tente with the West. His decision to allow the construction of the Berlin Wall was not merely a reaction to the immediate crisis of emigration but also a strategic move to stabilize East Germany and assert Soviet control. The wall was framed as an \"Anti-Fascist Protective Wall,\" which highlights the propaganda aspect of the decision. This reflects the internal pressures within the Eastern Bloc, particularly from hardliners like Ulbricht, who were resistant to any form of rapprochement with the West.\n\n**Expert 3: Sociocultural Perspective**\nFrom a sociocultural standpoint, the Berlin Wall represented more than just a political barrier; it was a symbol of division that affected millions of lives. The wall was constructed as a desperate measure to stem the tide of emigration, which had reached alarming levels. The East German government, under Ulbricht's leadership, was facing a crisis of legitimacy, and the wall was a means to control the narrative and maintain power. Khrushchev's support for this drastic measure can be seen as a reflection of the broader ideological battle between communism and capitalism, where the wall became a physical manifestation of that struggle.\n\n**Expert 4: Economic Implications Expert**\nI would like to add that the economic implications of the Berlin Wall's construction were significant. Khrushchev's visit to East Berlin after the wall was built, where he noted that the wall had stabilized the East German economy, underscores the economic motivations behind this decision. The wall was not only a political barrier but also a means to prevent economic collapse in East Germany.

Nikita Khrushchev's role as the Soviet leader is central to this event, as he provided the necessary approval for the wall's construction. However, the motivations behind this decision are complex, involving political, sociocultural, and economic factors. \n\n1. **Political Dynamics**: Khrushchev's leadership was marked by a balancing act between hardline policies and attempts at d\u00e9tente, with the wall serving as a tool for stabilizing East Germany.\n   \n2. **Sociocultural Impact**: The wall symbolized the ideological divide of the Cold War and had profound effects on the lives of individuals, reflecting the regime's desperation to maintain control.\n\n3. **Economic Considerations**: The wall was also an economic strategy to prevent the loss of skilled labor and stabilize the East German economy, highlighting the interplay between political decisions and economic realities.\n\nIn conclusion, the leadership of the Soviet Union during the Berlin Wall's construction was characterized by Khrushchev's strategic decisions influenced by a range of factors.

The Berlin Wall was constructed on August 13, 1961, during the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev, who was the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1953 until 1964. \n\n1. **Historical Context**: The construction of the Berlin Wall was a significant event in Cold War history, driven by the need to address the mass emigration from East Germany to West Germany. Khrushchev's approval of the wall was crucial, as he recognized the potential collapse of the East German state if the emigration crisis continued. This decision was not only a response to immediate pressures but also part of a broader strategy to maintain Soviet influence in Eastern Europe.\n\n2. **Political Dynamics**: Khrushchev's leadership was characterized by a complex interplay of aggression and attempts at d\u00e9tente with the West. The wall was framed as an \"Anti-Fascist Protective Wall,\" which served both as a propaganda tool and a means to stabilize the East German regime. This reflects the internal pressures within the Eastern Bloc, particularly from hardliners like Walter Ulbricht, who were resistant to any form of rapprochement with the West.\n\n3. **Sociocultural Perspective**: The wall symbolized a deep ideological divide and had profound implications for the lives of individuals. It was constructed as a desperate measure to stem the tide of emigration and maintain the legitimacy of the East German government. Khrushchev's support for this drastic action can be viewed as a reflection of the broader ideological battle between communism and capitalism.\n\n4. **Economic Implications**: The economic motivations behind the wall's construction were significant. Khrushchev noted that the wall had stabilized the East German economy by preventing the emigration of skilled workers. This highlights the interplay between political decisions and economic realities, as the East German regime sought to bolster its economy through this drastic measure.\n\nIn synthesizing these perspectives, it becomes clear that Khrushchev's leadership during the construction of the Berlin Wall was influenced by a combination of political, sociocultural, and economic factors. His strategic decisions were aimed at stabilizing East Germany and asserting Soviet control, while also addressing the immediate crisis of emigration.\n\n**Answer:**\nNikita Khrushchev was the leader of the Soviet Union when the Berlin Wall was built. His leadership was marked by a complex interplay of political, sociocultural, and economic factors that influenced the decision to construct the wall as a means of stabilizing East Germany and maintaining Soviet influence during a critical period of the Cold War."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nwho was the leader of the soviet union when the berlin wall was built\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['BULLET::::- On a visit to East Germany, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev agreed to let DDR leader Walter Ulbricht order construction of the Berlin Wall.\\n', 'Heinz Sokolowski (17 December 1917 \u2013 25 November 1965) was a German man who became the sixty-fourth known person to die at the Berlin Wall. Sokolowski, a former political prisoner, was shot and killed by East German border troops while attempting to cross the Berlin Wall near to the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag building.\\n', 'Walter Ulbricht, the East German leader, invited Pervukhin to his summer house to discuss the East German immigration flow to West Germany. There Ulbricht told Pervukhin that if the Soviets did not react soon, East Germany would \"collapse\". Pervukhin discussed other problems as well, claiming that Ulbricht but also the East German leadership in general, were opposed to the Soviet Union\\'s plan to improve relations with West Germany. When Khrushchev gave his approval to construct what would become the Berlin Wall, Pervukhin was the first to know. Ulbricht told Pervukhin of the need to create the East\u2013West barrier at night, and he and Khrushchev would later agree to this.\\n', 'In 1975 he was sent back to Berlin where he served a second stint as Soviet ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, remaining in post this time till 1983. His years as ambassador were not without Soviet-East German tensions. During the early 1960s the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev was interested in exploring a less confrontational relationship with the west while the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht, remained uncompromisingly hard-line in his attitude to the west in general and in his country\\'s relationship with West Germany specifically. The decision suddenly to erect the Berlin Wall in August 1961 was naturally taken by the East Germans in full consultation with the Soviet ambassador. From the East German perspective The Wall represented a necessary desperate attempt to save the state which appeared to be in the process of losing its entire working age population. With Abrassimov as Soviet ambassador in Berlin, Walter Ulbricht, who had earlier enjoyed close relations with Soviet leader Josef Stalin, found he enjoyed far less direct contact with the Soviet leadership in Moscow. In 1963/64, when Ulbricht moved to control air traffic flying into West Berlin, it was Abrassimov who prevented the move. He actively opposed East German reluctance to conclude a belated post war peace treaty with West Germany, and in 1966 set up direct links with Willy Brandt, then the mayor of West Berlin, without telling the leadership of the East German ruling SED (party). Abrassimov also participated regularly in meetings of the East German cabinet, something which had never happened when Mikhail Pervukhin was the Soviet ambassador. The relationship between the Soviet ambassador and the East German leadership did not improve with the appointment of a new East German leader, Erich Honecker, in 1971. During the 1980s Abrassimov\\'s growing propensity to meet regularly with western ambassadors to Berlin without reference to his East German host government did not help matters. In 1983 he was seen to be becoming ever more paternalistic and autocratic in his ambassadorial office, and following the death of Leonid Brezhnev at the end of 1982, Honecker managed to persuade Moscow to replace Abrassimov because of the extent of his \"interference in East German domestic politics\".\\n', 'Walter Ulbricht (1893\u20131973) was the party boss from 1950 to 1971. In 1933, Ulbricht had fled to Moscow, where he served as a Comintern agent loyal to Stalin. As World War II was ending, Stalin assigned him the job of designing the postwar German system that would centralize all power in the Communist Party. Ulbricht became deputy prime minister in 1949 and secretary (chief executive) of the Socialist Unity (Communist) party in 1950. Some 2.6 million people had fled East Germany by 1961 when he built the Berlin Wall to stop them \u2014 shooting those who attempted it. What the GDR called the \"Anti-Fascist Protective Wall\" was a major embarrassment for the program during the Cold War, but it did stabilize East Germany and postpone its collapse. Ulbricht lost power in 1971, but was kept on as a nominal head of state. He was replaced because he failed to solve growing national crises, such as the worsening economy in 1969\u201370, the fear of another popular uprising as had occurred in 1953, and the disgruntlement between Moscow and Berlin caused by Ulbricht\\'s d\u00e9tente policies toward the West.\\n', \"After World War II, Germans tended to prefer living in West Germany over East Germany, and Berlin became a major escape route for people wanting to leave the Soviet sphere of influence for the West. This led to major-power conflict over Berlin that stretched at least from 1946 to the construction of the Berlin wall in 1961. After U.S. President Truman was replaced by Eisenhower in 1953 and Khrushchev became Soviet head of state in 1958, Khrushchev tried to push Eisenhower on Berlin in 1958-59. The Soviets backed down when Ike's resolve seemed to match that of Truman.

On 1 April 1952, East German leaders met the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in Moscow; during the discussions Stalin\\'s foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov proposed that the East Germans should \"introduce a system of passes for visits of West Berlin residents to the territory of East Berlin [so as to stop] free movement of Western agents\" in the GDR. Stalin agreed, calling the situation \"intolerable\". He advised the East Germans to build up their border defenses, telling them that \"The demarcation line between East and West Germany should be considered a border\u2014and not just any border, but a dangerous one ... The Germans will guard the line of defence with their lives.\"\\n', 'In a speech at the Brandenburg Gate commemorating the 750th anniversary of Berlin on 12 June 1987, U.S. President Ronald Reagan challenged Mikhail Gorbachev, then the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to tear down the Wall as a symbol of increasing freedom in the Eastern Bloc:\\n', 'BULLET::::- Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev made a visit to the Berlin Wall from the East Berlin side, then delivered an address to the Communist leadership of East Germany at the SED Party Congress.

To determine who was the leader of the Soviet Union at that time, we need to identify the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union during that period. Nikita Khrushchev served as the leader of the Soviet Union from 1953 until 1964. Since the construction of the Berlin Wall occurred in 1961, it falls within Khrushchev's leadership period.\n\nFurther examination of authoritative sources confirms that:\n1. **Nikita Khrushchev's Role**: He was indeed the Soviet leader during the construction of the Berlin Wall, as indicated by multiple passages stating that he agreed to the construction in consultation with East German leader Walter Ulbricht.\n2. **Context of the Berlin Wall's Construction**: The decision to build the Wall was a response to the mass emigration from East Germany to West Germany, which was a significant concern for both East German leadership and the Soviet Union. This context highlights the urgency and necessity perceived by the Soviet leadership in stabilizing East Germany.\n3. **Khrushchev's Statements**: Khrushchev acknowledged the Wall's purpose in stemming the exodus of citizens and stabilizing the East German economy, further emphasizing his active role in the decision-making process regarding the Wall.\n\nBy integrating this information, we can confirm that Nikita Khrushchev was not only the leader during this critical period but also an active participant in the decision to construct the Berlin Wall, which was seen as a necessary measure to prevent further emigration and stabilize the East German state.\n\n### Answer:\nNikita Khrushchev was the leader of the Soviet Union when the Berlin Wall was built on August 13, 1961."}], "question_info": {"question": "who was the leader of the soviet union when the berlin wall was built", "passages": ["BULLET::::- On a visit to East Germany, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev agreed to let DDR leader Walter Ulbricht order construction of the Berlin Wall.\n", "Heinz Sokolowski (17 December 1917 \u2013 25 November 1965) was a German man who became the sixty-fourth known person to die at the Berlin Wall. Sokolowski, a former political prisoner, was shot and killed by East German border troops while attempting to cross the Berlin Wall near to the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag building.\n", "Walter Ulbricht, the East German leader, invited Pervukhin to his summer house to discuss the East German immigration flow to West Germany. There Ulbricht told Pervukhin that if the Soviets did not react soon, East Germany would \"collapse\". Pervukhin discussed other problems as well, claiming that Ulbricht but also the East German leadership in general, were opposed to the Soviet Union's plan to improve relations with West Germany. When Khrushchev gave his approval to construct what would become the Berlin Wall, Pervukhin was the first to know. Ulbricht told Pervukhin of the need to create the East\u2013West barrier at night, and he and Khrushchev would later agree to this.\n", "In 1975 he was sent back to Berlin where he served a second stint as Soviet ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, remaining in post this time till 1983. His years as ambassador were not without Soviet-East German tensions. During the early 1960s the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev was interested in exploring a less confrontational relationship with the west while the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht, remained uncompromisingly hard-line in his attitude to the west in general and in his country's relationship with West Germany specifically. The decision suddenly to erect the Berlin Wall in August 1961 was naturally taken by the East Germans in full consultation with the Soviet ambassador. From the East German perspective The Wall represented a necessary desperate attempt to save the state which appeared to be in the process of losing its entire working age population. With Abrassimov as Soviet ambassador in Berlin, Walter Ulbricht, who had earlier enjoyed close relations with Soviet leader Josef Stalin, found he enjoyed far less direct contact with the Soviet leadership in Moscow. In 1963/64, when Ulbricht moved to control air traffic flying into West Berlin, it was Abrassimov who prevented the move. He actively opposed East German reluctance to conclude a belated post war peace treaty with West Germany, and in 1966 set up direct links with Willy Brandt, then the mayor of West Berlin, without telling the leadership of the East German ruling SED (party). Abrassimov also participated regularly in meetings of the East German cabinet, something which had never happened when Mikhail Pervukhin was the Soviet ambassador. The relationship between the Soviet ambassador and the East German leadership did not improve with the appointment of a new East German leader, Erich Honecker, in 1971. During the 1980s Abrassimov's growing propensity to meet regularly with western ambassadors to Berlin without reference to his East German host government did not help matters. In 1983 he was seen to be becoming ever more paternalistic and autocratic in his ambassadorial office, and following the death of Leonid Brezhnev at the end of 1982, Honecker managed to persuade Moscow to replace Abrassimov because of the extent of his \"interference in East German domestic politics\".\n", "Walter Ulbricht (1893\u20131973) was the party boss from 1950 to 1971. In 1933, Ulbricht had fled to Moscow, where he served as a Comintern agent loyal to Stalin. As World War II was ending, Stalin assigned him the job of designing the postwar German system that would centralize all power in the Communist Party. Ulbricht became deputy prime minister in 1949 and secretary (chief executive) of the Socialist Unity (Communist) party in 1950. Some 2.6 million people had fled East Germany by 1961 when he built the Berlin Wall to stop them \u2014 shooting those who attempted it. What the GDR called the \"Anti-Fascist Protective Wall\" was a major embarrassment for the program during the Cold War, but it did stabilize East Germany and postpone its collapse. Ulbricht lost power in 1971, but was kept on as a nominal head of state. He was replaced because he failed to solve growing national crises, such as the worsening economy in 1969\u201370, the fear of another popular uprising as had occurred in 1953, and the disgruntlement between Moscow and Berlin caused by Ulbricht's d\u00e9tente policies toward the West.\n", "After World War II, Germans tended to prefer living in West Germany over East Germany, and Berlin became a major escape route for people wanting to leave the Soviet sphere of influence for the West. This led to major-power conflict over Berlin that stretched at least from 1946 to the construction of the Berlin wall in 1961. After U.S. President Truman was replaced by Eisenhower in 1953 and Khrushchev became Soviet head of state in 1958, Khrushchev tried to push Eisenhower on Berlin in 1958-59. The Soviets backed down when Ike's resolve seemed to match that of Truman. When Ike was replaced by Kennedy in 1961, Khrushchev tried again, with essentially the same result.\n", "Up until 1952, the demarcation lines between East Germany and the western occupied zones could be easily crossed in most places. On 1 April 1952, East German leaders met the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in Moscow; during the discussions Stalin's foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov proposed that the East Germans should \"introduce a system of passes for visits of West Berlin residents to the territory of East Berlin [so as to stop] free movement of Western agents\" in the GDR. Stalin agreed, calling the situation \"intolerable\". He advised the East Germans to build up their border defenses, telling them that \"The demarcation line between East and West Germany should be considered a border\u2014and not just any border, but a dangerous one ... The Germans will guard the line of defence with their lives.\"\n", "In a speech at the Brandenburg Gate commemorating the 750th anniversary of Berlin on 12 June 1987, U.S. President Ronald Reagan challenged Mikhail Gorbachev, then the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to tear down the Wall as a symbol of increasing freedom in the Eastern Bloc:\n", "BULLET::::- Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev made a visit to the Berlin Wall from the East Berlin side, then delivered an address to the Communist leadership of East Germany at the SED Party Congress. Khrushchev stated bluntly that the Wall had accomplished its purpose of stemming the exodus of citizens from the nation and stabilized the East German economy, and added that further Soviet economic assistance would not be forthcoming. \"Neither God nor the devil will give you bread or butter if you do not manage it with your own hands,\" Khrushchev said, adding that East Germany \"must not expect alms from some rich uncle\".\n", "Into the 1980s, the Soviet Union experienced a period of economic and political stagnation, and correspondingly decreased intervention in Eastern Bloc politics. In 1987, US President Ronald Reagan gave a speech at the Brandenburg Gate, challenging Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to \"tear down the wall\" which divided Berlin. The wall had stood as an icon for the political and economic division between East and West, a division that Churchill had referred to as the \"Iron Curtain\". Gorbachev announced in 1988 that the Soviet Union would abandon the Brezhnev Doctrine and allow the Eastern bloc nations to freely determine their own internal affairs. In early 1989, under a new era of Soviet policies of \"glasnost\" (openness), \"perestroika\" (economic restructuring) and taken further by Gorbachev, the Solidarity movement took hold in Poland. Further inspired by other images of brave defiance, a wave of revolutions swept throughout the Eastern Bloc that year. In May 1989, Hungary removed their border fence and thousands of East Germans escaped to the West \u2014 although even then, very many people inside and outside Germany still believed that a real reunification would never happen in the foreseeable future.\n"], "__answers__": ["Khrushchev", "Joseph Stalin", "Nikita Khrushchev"]}}
