The emergence of genres such as 'Sebayt' indicates a growing appreciation for written expression beyond mere practical uses.\n\n6. **Cultural and Historical Context**: The origins of writing in Ancient Egypt are closely tied to kingship and the afterlife, as evidenced by early inscriptions found in royal tombs. The role of scribes in institutions like the 'Per Ankh' was crucial for preserving knowledge and culture. Additionally, the influence of external cultures, particularly during the Greco-Roman period, led to significant changes in Egyptian writing styles, highlighting the dynamic nature of writing systems.\n\n7. **Integration of Perspectives**: The discussion among experts reveals a consensus on the significance of hieroglyphs and the evolution of writing systems. While there is some disagreement regarding the emphasis on literary versus practical uses, all perspectives contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how writing in Ancient Egypt was multifaceted and reflective of its complex society.\n\n**Answer:**\nAncient Egypt primarily used three main writing systems: hieroglyphics, hieratic, and demotic scripts. Hieroglyphics served as the formal writing system, characterized by its complexity and used mainly for religious texts and monumental inscriptions. Hieratic was a simplified, cursive form of hieroglyphics that became dominant for everyday writing on papyrus, facilitating administrative and literary tasks. Later, demotic script evolved from hieratic and was used for more common and administrative purposes.

Later, demotic script evolved from hieratic and was used for more common and administrative purposes. The writing systems served different functions within ancient Egyptian society, reflecting a rich literary tradition and the organized nature of writing and literacy, with scribes playing a crucial role in maintaining records and literature."}], "question_info": {"question": "what type of writing did ancient egypt use", "passages": ["Egyptian hieroglyphs () were the formal writing system used in Ancient Egypt. Hieroglyphs combined logographic, syllabic and alphabetic elements, with a total of some 1,000 distinct characters.\n", "Hieratic was used alongside hieroglyphs for writing in Old and Middle Egyptian, becoming the dominant form of writing in Late Egyptian. By the New Kingdom and throughout the rest of ancient Egyptian history, Middle Egyptian became a classical language that was usually reserved for reading and writing in hieroglyphs and the spoken language for more exalted forms of literature, such as historical records, commemorative autobiographies, hymns, and funerary spells. However, Middle Kingdom literature written in Middle Egyptian was also rewritten in hieratic during later periods.\n", "Writing first appeared in association with kingship on labels and tags for items found in royal tombs. It was primarily an occupation of the scribes, who worked out of the \"Per Ankh\" institution or the House of Life. The latter comprised offices, libraries (called House of Books), laboratories and observatories. Some of the best-known pieces of ancient Egyptian literature, such as the Pyramid and Coffin Texts, were written in Classical Egyptian, which continued to be the language of writing until about 1300\u00a0BC. Late Egyptian was spoken from the New Kingdom onward and is represented in Ramesside administrative documents, love poetry and tales, as well as in Demotic and Coptic texts. During this period, the tradition of writing had evolved into the tomb autobiography, such as those of Harkhuf and Weni. The genre known as \"Sebayt\" (\"instructions\") was developed to communicate teachings and guidance from famous nobles; the Ipuwer papyrus, a poem of lamentations describing natural disasters and social upheaval, is a famous example.\n", "BULLET::::- Writing in Ancient Egypt\n", "Writing was introduced to Ethiopia as far back as the 5th century BC with the ancient South Arabian script. This South Semitic script served as the basis for the creation of Ethiopia's Ge'ez script, the oldest evidence for it found in Matara, Eritrea, and dated to the 2nd century AD. However, the 1st-century AD Roman \"Periplus of the Erythraean Sea\" asserts that the local ruler of Adulis could speak and write in Greek. This embrace of Hellenism could also be found in the coinage of Aksumite currency, in which legends were usually written in Greek, much like ancient Greek coinage.\n", "It was also during this period that the Egyptian writing system was further developed. Initially Egyptian writing had been composed primarily of a few symbols denoting amounts of various substances. By the end of the 3rd dynasty it had been expanded to include more than 200 symbols, both phonograms and ideograms.\n", "The oldest forms of the letters in antiquity are majuscule forms. Besides the upright, straight inscriptional forms (capitals) found in stone carvings or incised pottery, more fluent writing styles adapted for handwriting on soft materials were also developed during antiquity. Such handwriting has been preserved especially from papyrus manuscripts in Egypt since the Hellenistic period. Ancient handwriting developed two distinct styles: uncial writing, with carefully drawn, rounded block letters of about equal size, used as a book hand for carefully produced literary and religious manuscripts, and cursive writing, used for everyday purposes. The cursive forms approached the style of lowercase letter forms, with ascenders and descenders, as well as many connecting lines and ligatures between letters.\n", "By the Roman Period of Egypt, the traditional Egyptian reed pen had been replaced by the chief writing tool of the Greco-Roman world: a shorter, thicker reed pen with a cut nib. Likewise, the original Egyptian pigments were discarded in favor of Greek lead-based inks. The adoption of Greco-Roman writing tools influenced Egyptian handwriting, as hieratic signs became more spaced, had rounder flourishes, and greater angular precision.\n", "Just as there is a unique style of writing associated with Ashkenazi scrolls, and another style for Sephardic scrolls, so too is there a style of writing that is peculiar to Yemenite scribes of the previous centuries. Each community, however, makes use of the square Hebrew script. In some scrolls of Yemenite provenance, there was not a practice among scribes to write the Hebrew letters with their \"Tagim\", since the accurate tradition of doing so had long been lost. The ancient practice in Yemen when writing the letter \"\u1e25et\" (\u05d7) is to make its roof flat, and not a \"gable-roof,\" as prescribed by Rabbeinu Tam (Yaakov Meir), although more modern scrolls have adopted Rabbeinu Tam's method. The difference stems from one's understanding of the word \u05d7\u05d8\u05e8\u05d9 in Tractate \"Mena\u1e25oth\". In Yemenite scrolls, the Hebrew letters are made to suspend a fraction below the ruled lines, rather than hang directly from the ruled lines.\n", "Richard B. Parkinson and Ludwig D. Morenz write that ancient Egyptian literature\u2014narrowly defined as \"belles-lettres\" (\"beautiful writing\")\u2014was not recorded in written form until the early Twelfth dynasty of the Middle Kingdom. Old Kingdom texts served mainly to maintain the divine cults, preserve souls in the afterlife, and document accounts for practical uses in daily life. It was not until the Middle Kingdom that texts were written for the purpose of entertainment and intellectual curiosity. Parkinson and Morenz also speculate that written works of the Middle Kingdom were transcriptions of the oral literature of the Old Kingdom. It is known that some oral poetry was preserved in later writing; for example, litter-bearers' songs were preserved as written verses in tomb inscriptions of the Old Kingdom.\n"], "__answers__": ["hieroglyphs", "Egyptian hieroglyphs"]}}
