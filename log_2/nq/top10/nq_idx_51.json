The Senate has 100 members, needing at least 51 votes for a majority (or 50 votes plus the Vice President's tie-breaking vote).\n\n3. **Current Composition**: As of October 2023, we need to analyze the party distribution in both chambers. The majority party is defined as the one holding the most seats.\n\n4. **Extracted Information**: From the retrieved knowledge:\n   - The Democratic Party holds the majority in both the House and Senate.\n   - In the Senate, there are 25 Democrats and 15 Republicans, indicating a clear Democratic majority.\n   - In the General Assembly, there are 55 Democrats and 26 Republicans, further confirming Democratic control.\n   - The Assembly has a 27 to 15 majority for Democrats, and the Senate has an 11 to 10 majority for Democrats.\n\n5. **Historical Context**: Understanding historical shifts in majority control helps in predicting future trends. For example, Republicans previously held significant majorities in various contexts, but the current data shows a Democratic majority.\n\n6. **Leadership Roles and Influence**: The roles of key leaders, such as the Senate majority leader, are crucial for understanding how legislative agendas are set and how party control can influence policy outcomes. The current Democratic leaders (Leroy Garcia as President of the Senate and Steve Fenberg as Majority Leader) play a significant role in shaping legislative priorities.\n\n7. **Causal Relationships**: By recognizing the majority party's control, we can infer potential legislative actions, policy changes, and the likelihood of passing specific bills. The historical context allows for a better understanding of how shifts in majority can impact governance.\n\n### Answer:\nAs of October 2023, the Democratic Party holds the majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. In the Senate, there are 25 Democrats and 15 Republicans, while in the General Assembly, there are 55 Democrats and 26 Republicans. The Democratic Party controls the Assembly with a 27 to 15 majority and the Senate with an 11 to 10 majority.
