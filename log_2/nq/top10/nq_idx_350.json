The series focuses on the dynamics of a widowed father raising his daughters, and D.J. plays a significant role in that narrative as the responsible older sibling.\n\n**Expert 2: Pop Culture Analyst**\nWhile I agree that D.J. is the middle sister in terms of age, it's important to clarify that Michelle Tanner is often mistakenly referred to as the middle sister due to her prominence in the series. The Olsen twins' portrayal of Michelle became iconic, overshadowing the other characters at times. This highlights how pop culture can sometimes distort character roles based on popularity rather than narrative structure.\n\n**Expert 3: Character Development Specialist**\nI would like to add that the character of Kimmy Gibbler, played by Andrea Barber, is also crucial to the show's dynamic. While she is not a Tanner sister, her role as D.J.'s best friend adds depth to the middle sister's storyline.

Tanner's role as the middle sister is significant. She often navigates the challenges of being a teenager while also taking on a caretaker role for her younger sister, Michelle. This duality in her character reflects real-life family structures where older siblings often assume responsibilities that can impact their development and relationships.\n\n**Points of Agreement and Disagreement:**\n- All experts agree that D.J.
