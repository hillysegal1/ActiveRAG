It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl. The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government-aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government-funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare. By 1946, it was estimated that of kudzu had been planted. When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms, kudzu plantings were left unattended. The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the kudzu to grow virtually unchecked. In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970.

This event marked its initial entry as an ornamental plant.\n   - It was further promoted in the Southeast in **1883** at the New Orleans Exposition, indicating a strategic effort to popularize its use in warmer climates.\n\n2. **Initial Uses and Government Involvement**:\n   - Initially marketed for decorative purposes, kudzu was later promoted for practical applications, such as high-protein cattle fodder and soil erosion control, particularly during the Great Depression when agricultural practices were under strain.\n   - The Soil Erosion Service and Civilian Conservation Corps played significant roles in cultivating kudzu to combat soil erosion, especially during the Dust Bowl, leading to the distribution of **85 million seedlings**. This government initiative illustrates how policy decisions can drive agricultural practices.\n\n3. **Spread and Consequences**:\n   - By the mid-20th century, kudzu began to spread uncontrollably in the Southeastern United States due to factors such as abandoned farmland and favorable growing conditions. This uncontrolled spread exemplifies how initial agricultural practices can lead to unintended ecological consequences.\n   - The USDA's decision to remove kudzu from suggested cover plants by **1953** and its classification as a weed by **1970** reflect a growing recognition of its invasive nature, culminating in its listing on the \"Federal Noxious Weed List\" by **1997**.\n\n4. **Current Status**:\n   - Today, kudzu covers significant areas in states like Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi, continuing to displace native plants and disrupt local ecosystems.

It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl. The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government-aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government-funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare. By 1946, it was estimated that of kudzu had been planted. When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms, kudzu plantings were left unattended. The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the kudzu to grow virtually unchecked. In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970. By 1997, the vine was placed on the \"Federal Noxious Weed List\".
