This nomenclature, which specifically derives from the German, is not used in Scandinavia where these sites are categorised by other, more general, terms, as dolmens (\"Dysser, D\u00f6ser\"), passage graves (\"Ganggrifter, J\u00e6ttestuen\") and stone cists (\"Hellekister, H\u00e4llkista\").\n", "Section::::European megaliths.:Spread of megalithic architecture in Europe.\n", "At a number of sites in eastern Turkey, large ceremonial complexes from the 9th millennium BC have been discovered. They belong to the incipient phases of agriculture and animal husbandry. Large circular structures involving carved megalithic orthostats are a typical feature; e.g. at Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori and G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Although these structures are the most ancient megalithic structures known so far, it is not clear that any of the European megalithic traditions (see below) are actually derived from them. At G\u00f6bekli Tepe, four stone circles have been excavated from an estimated 20. Some measure up to 30 metres across. As well as human figures, the stones carry a variety of carved reliefs depicting boars, foxes, lions, birds, snakes and scorpions.\n", "Since the Late-Neolithic, Aosta Valley, Piedmont, Liguria, Tuscany and Sardinia in particular were involved in the pan-Western European Megalithic phenomenon. Later, in the Bronze Age, megalithic structures were built also in Latium, Puglia and Sicily. This latter region, around the end of the third millennium B.C. imported from Sardinia typical cultural aspects of Atlantic world, including the \"Culture\" of small dolmen-shaped structures that reached all over the Mediterranean basin.\n", "It is one of the largest known ancient megalithic structures in Europe. It is long, wide and high, and was built with thirty-two megaliths, the largest weighing about . A very rare singularity, in megalithic buildings, is the presence of a deep and narrow well in the bottom of the chamber. It presents in the first orthostat of the corridor a series of anthropomorphic engravings in the form of a cross as well as a star.\n", "This article describes several characteristic architectural elements typical of European megalithic (Stone Age) structures.\n", "In the area of present-day Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany, up to 5,000 megalith tombs were erected as burial sites by people of the Neolithic Funnelbeaker (TRB) culture. More than 1,000 of them are preserved today and protected by law. Though varying in style and age, megalith structures are common in Western Europe, with those in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern belonging to the youngest and easternmost\u2014further east, in the modern West Pomeranian Voivodeship of Poland, monuments erected by the TRB people did not include lithic structures, while they do in the south (Brandenburg), west (Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein) and north (Denmark).\n", "Nordic megalith architecture\n"], "__answers__": ["the portal tomb", "portal tomb"]}}
