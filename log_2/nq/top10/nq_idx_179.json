The largest bill that was available to the public was the $10,000 bill, which featured a portrait of Salmon P. Chase. This bill was last printed in 1945 and was officially discontinued in 1969 as part of a broader move to eliminate high-denomination currency due to the increasing use of checks and electronic payments.\n\nHowever, the largest note ever printed was the $100,000 Gold Certificate, which featured a portrait of Woodrow Wilson. This certificate was issued only for transactions between Federal Reserve Banks and was never circulated among the general public. This distinction is crucial because it highlights the difference between currency that was intended for public use and that which was reserved for interbank transactions.\n\nThe expert discussion reveals several key insights:\n1. **Historical Context**: The $10,000 bill serves as a significant historical artifact of U.S. currency, reflecting the monetary practices of its time and the eventual transition away from high-denomination bills.\n2. **Economic Implications**: The withdrawal of high-denomination bills was a strategic decision influenced by concerns over money laundering and the need for more manageable currency in everyday transactions. The $100 bill, featuring Benjamin Franklin, has since become the largest denomination in circulation, indicating a shift in public trust and monetary policy.\n3. **Numismatic Value**: The $10,000 bill is highly sought after by collectors, while the $100,000 Gold Certificate, despite its lack of circulation, is notable for its rarity and the historical context of its issuance.\n\nIn conclusion, while the $100,000 Gold Certificate is the largest note ever printed, it was not available for public circulation. Therefore, the largest bill in American money that was ever in circulation is the $10,000 bill. This nuanced understanding emphasizes the complexities of U.S. currency history and the regulatory frameworks that have shaped its evolution.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe largest bill in American money that was ever in circulation is the $10,000 bill."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nwhat is the largest bill in american money\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n[\"Chase's portrait appears on the United States $10,000 bill, the largest denomination of U.S. currency to publicly circulate.

This distinction is essential to prevent misunderstandings regarding U.S. currency denominations and to address potential model illusions related to confidence in its outputs.\n\n### Answer:\nThe largest bill in American money that was ever in circulation is the $10,000 bill. However, the largest bill ever printed is the $100,000 Gold Certificate, which was not available to the public. The largest bill currently in circulation is the $100 bill."}], "question_info": {"question": "what is the largest bill in american money", "passages": ["Chase's portrait appears on the United States $10,000 bill, the largest denomination of U.S. currency to publicly circulate.

The reverse featured a bald eagle in flight clutching an American flag.\n", "The United States one hundred-dollar bill ($100) is a denomination of United States currency. The first United States Note with this value was issued in 1862 and the Federal Reserve Note version was launched in 1914, alongside other denominations. Statesman, inventor, diplomat, and American founding father Benjamin Franklin has been featured on the obverse of the bill since 1914.

The octagonal $50 piece is the only U.S. coin that is not round. The facilities at the San Francisco Mint were inadequate to strike such large coins as the $50 pieces, and a hydraulic medal press was shipped from Philadelphia. This press was ceremoniously operated at that mint on June 15, 1915 for the initial striking of $50 octagonal pieces; the first by San Francisco Mint Superintendent T. W. H. Shanahan, for presentation to the exposition's president, Charles C. Moore. The next nine were struck by other dignitaries, including Congressman Kahn.
