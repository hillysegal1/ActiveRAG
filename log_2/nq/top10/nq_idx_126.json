The most prominent hyena is **Shenzi**, who is depicted as the leader of the hyena pack. She is voiced by Whoopi Goldberg, which adds to her recognition and character development. Alongside Shenzi, there are other notable hyenas, **Banzai** and **Ed**, who contribute to the dynamics of the group.\n\n1. **Character Identification**:\n   - Shenzi is the most recognized hyena, serving as a key character in the story. Banzai and Ed are also important but are often seen as secondary to Shenzi's leadership role.\n\n2. **Character Relationships and Dynamics**:\n   - The hyenas are portrayed as followers of Scar, indicating a hierarchical relationship where they fear him and depend on him for power and sustenance. This relationship can be analyzed to understand themes of loyalty, manipulation, and the consequences of power dynamics in social structures.\n\n3. **Cultural References**:\n   - The hyenas are depicted as vicious carnivores, which reflects broader cultural narratives about predators and their roles in ecosystems. Their portrayal as antagonists can lead to discussions about societal views on certain animals and their symbolic meanings in storytelling.\n\n4. **Legacy and Descendants**:\n   - In \"The Lion Guard,\" it is noted that new hyenas are descendants of Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. This suggests a continuation of their legacy and opens up discussions about how character traits and behaviors can be inherited or influence future generations.\n\n5. **Voice Acting and Character Development**:\n   - The transition of Shenzi's character from a male to a female voice actor (from Chong to Whoopi Goldberg) highlights the evolution of character design and representation in animation. This change can impact how audiences perceive characters and their roles in the narrative.\n\n6. **Narrative Impact**:\n   - The ambiguous fate of the hyenas after Scar's death invites speculation about their future and the potential for character growth or decline. This ambiguity can lead to discussions about narrative closure and the implications of unresolved character arcs.\n\n### Analysis of Impact on Causal Reasoning and Logical Inference:\n\n1. **Understanding Relationships**:\n   - By analyzing the relationships between characters, the model can improve its ability to infer motivations and consequences of actions within a narrative context. This understanding is crucial for predicting future interactions and outcomes based on established dynamics.\n\n2. **Character Development**:\n   - Recognizing the significance of character traits and their evolution can enhance the model's ability to predict character behavior based on their backgrounds and relationships.\n\n3. **Legacy and Continuity**:\n   - The mention of descendants allows the model to reason about the implications of legacy in storytelling, inferring that characters' actions may have long-term effects on their descendants.\n\n4. **Cultural Context**:\n   - Understanding the portrayal of hyenas as antagonists can help the model analyze broader themes of morality, survival, and societal roles in storytelling, enhancing its ability to draw parallels between different narratives.\n\n5. **Narrative Ambiguity**:\n   - The ambiguous fate of the hyenas encourages the model to consider multiple possible outcomes and the reasons behind narrative choices, improving its capacity for critical thinking and inference-making.\n\nBy consolidating these insights, the model can develop a more nuanced understanding of character dynamics, narrative structures, and thematic elements, ultimately enhancing its causal reasoning and logical inference capabilities.\n\n### Answer:\nThe name of the hyena in \"The Lion King\" is **Shenzi**.
