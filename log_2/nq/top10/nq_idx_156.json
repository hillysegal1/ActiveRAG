In 1923, Arnold Schoenberg (1874\u20131951) developed his own, better-known version of 12-tone technique, which became associated with the \"Second Viennese School\" composers, who were the primary users of the technique in the first decades of its existence. The technique is a means of ensuring that all 12 notes of the chromatic scale are sounded as often as one another in a piece of music while preventing the emphasis of any one note through the use of tone rows, orderings of the 12 pitch classes. All 12 notes are thus given more or less equal importance, and the music avoids being in a key. Over time, the technique increased greatly in popularity and eventually became widely influential on 20th-century composers.

Later, his name would come to personify innovations in atonality (although Schoenberg himself detested that term) that would become the most polemical feature of 20th-century art music. In the 1920s, Schoenberg developed the twelve-tone technique, an influential compositional method of manipulating an ordered series of all twelve notes in the chromatic scale. He also coined the term developing variation and was the first modern composer to embrace ways of developing motifs without resorting to the dominance of a centralized melodic idea.\\n', 'In the early 1920s, he worked at evolving a means of order that would make his musical texture simpler and clearer. This resulted in the \"method of composing with twelve tones which are related only with one another\" , in which the twelve pitches of the octave (unrealized compositionally) are regarded as equal, and no one note or tonality is given the emphasis it occupied in classical harmony.

This requires an exploration of both the historical context and the innovations that led to the establishment of this system.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: The twelve-tone technique is often attributed to Arnold Schoenberg, who is recognized for his significant departure from traditional tonal music. However, it is essential to acknowledge that Josef Matthias Hauer published his \"law of the twelve tones\" in 1919, which laid the groundwork for this compositional method. This historical context is crucial for understanding the evolution of the twelve-tone system.\n\n3. **Schoenberg's Innovations**: While Hauer's contributions are important, Schoenberg's development of the twelve-tone technique represented a profound innovation. His approach allowed for greater flexibility in manipulating the twelve-tone rows, which was not fully explored by Hauer. This distinction highlights Schoenberg's pivotal role in transforming the twelve-tone system into a widely influential compositional tool.\n\n4. **Philosophical Shift**: Schoenberg's abandonment of traditional harmony signifies a philosophical shift in music composition. He aimed to create a system where no single note or tonality dominated, marking a radical departure from the diatonic system that had governed Western music for centuries. This shift not only altered compositional practices but also changed how music was perceived by listeners, inviting them to engage with music in new and challenging ways.\n\n5. **Influence on 20th-Century Music**: Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique had a significant impact on a wide range of composers in the 20th century, including those who initially opposed it, such as Aaron Copland and Igor Stravinsky. This adaptability underscores the robustness of the twelve-tone system as a compositional method, demonstrating its ability to coexist with and influence other musical styles, including jazz.\n\n6. **Collaborative Nature of Innovation**: The discussion also highlights the role of Schoenberg's students and contemporaries in the evolution of the twelve-tone technique. The anecdote about Tremblay discovering the twelve-tone system independently illustrates that this method was part of a broader exploration of new musical ideas, emphasizing the collaborative nature of musical innovation.\n\n7. **Synthesis of Insights**: By synthesizing these perspectives, we gain a multifaceted understanding of the twelve-tone system's origins and implications. While Hauer's early work is essential to acknowledge, Schoenberg's innovations and philosophical shifts are what truly transformed the landscape of 20th-century music. The technique's influence extended beyond classical music, impacting genres like jazz and demonstrating its versatility and relevance.\n\n8. **Cultural and Artistic Movement**: The twelve-tone system should be viewed not merely as a compositional method but as a significant cultural and artistic movement that reshaped music in the 20th century and beyond. This broader perspective enriches our understanding of the twelve-tone technique as part of a collective search for new forms of expression in music.\n\n**Answer**: \nThe composer who abandoned traditional harmony and created the twelve-tone system for composition is Arnold Schoenberg. While Josef Matthias Hauer laid the groundwork for this technique, Schoenberg's innovations and philosophical shifts in composition were pivotal in transforming the twelve-tone system into a widely influential method in 20th-century music."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nwho abandoned traditional harmony and created the twelve-tone system for composition\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The twelve-tone technique\u2014also known as dodecaphony, twelve-tone serialism, and (in British usage) twelve-note composition\u2014is a method of musical composition first devised by Austrian composer Josef Matthias Hauer, who published his \"law of the twelve tones\" in 1919. In 1923, Arnold Schoenberg (1874\u20131951) developed his own, better-known version of 12-tone technique, which became associated with the \"Second Viennese School\" composers, who were the primary users of the technique in the first decades of its existence. The technique is a means of ensuring that all 12 notes of the chromatic scale are sounded as often as one another in a piece of music while preventing the emphasis of any one note through the use of tone rows, orderings of the 12 pitch classes. All 12 notes are thus given more or less equal importance, and the music avoids being in a key.

However, it is crucial to recognize that Josef Matthias Hauer also contributed to the twelve-tone technique, having published his \"law of the twelve tones\" in 1919, which predates Schoenberg's work. This indicates that Hauer should also be acknowledged for his role in the invention of the twelve-tone technique.\n5. Schoenberg developed his own version of the twelve-tone technique in the early 1920s, which became more widely known and influential than Hauer's earlier contributions. This distinction is important for understanding the evolution of the technique and its impact on 20th-century music.\n6. The term \"dodecaphony\" is synonymous with the twelve-tone technique, and while Schoenberg is credited with popularizing it, Hauer's contributions should not be overlooked.\n7. The twelve-tone technique significantly influenced many composers, including those who initially opposed it, such as Aaron Copland and Igor Stravinsky, highlighting its broader impact beyond the Second Viennese School.\n8. Schoenberg viewed his twelve-tone method as a revolutionary development in music, akin to Einstein's discoveries in physics, emphasizing the importance he placed on his contributions to music theory.\n\nBy integrating these points into the model's knowledge base, it can provide a more nuanced and accurate understanding of the twelve-tone system, its origins, and its significance in the context of 20th-century music.\n\n**Answer:**\nWhile Arnold Schoenberg is primarily credited with the development of the twelve-tone system, it is important to acknowledge that Josef Matthias Hauer also played a significant role by publishing his \"law of the twelve tones\" in 1919.

In 1923, Arnold Schoenberg (1874\u20131951) developed his own, better-known version of 12-tone technique, which became associated with the \"Second Viennese School\" composers, who were the primary users of the technique in the first decades of its existence. The technique is a means of ensuring that all 12 notes of the chromatic scale are sounded as often as one another in a piece of music while preventing the emphasis of any one note through the use of tone rows, orderings of the 12 pitch classes. All 12 notes are thus given more or less equal importance, and the music avoids being in a key. Over time, the technique increased greatly in popularity and eventually became widely influential on 20th-century composers. Many important composers who had originally not subscribed to or even actively opposed the technique, such as Aaron Copland and Igor Stravinsky, eventually adopted it in their music.\n", "BULLET::::- The twelve-tone technique (also dodecaphony) is a method of musical composition devised by Arnold Schoenberg. Music using the technique is called twelve-tone music.\n", "BULLET::::- In the 1920s, Arnold Schoenberg developed the twelve-tone technique, which became widely influential on 20th-century composers.\n", "A second direction in the search for a new tonality was twelve-tone serialism. Arnold Schoenberg developed the twelve-tone method of composition as an alternative to the structure provided by the diatonic system. His method entails building a piece using a series of the twelve notes of the chromatic scale, permuting it and superimposing it on itself to create the composition.\n", "Schoenberg was known early in his career for simultaneously extending the traditionally opposed German Romantic styles of Brahms and Wagner. Later, his name would come to personify innovations in atonality (although Schoenberg himself detested that term) that would become the most polemical feature of 20th-century art music. In the 1920s, Schoenberg developed the twelve-tone technique, an influential compositional method of manipulating an ordered series of all twelve notes in the chromatic scale. He also coined the term developing variation and was the first modern composer to embrace ways of developing motifs without resorting to the dominance of a centralized melodic idea.\n", "In the early 1920s, he worked at evolving a means of order that would make his musical texture simpler and clearer. This resulted in the \"method of composing with twelve tones which are related only with one another\" , in which the twelve pitches of the octave (unrealized compositionally) are regarded as equal, and no one note or tonality is given the emphasis it occupied in classical harmony. He regarded it as the equivalent in music of Albert Einstein's discoveries in physics. Schoenberg announced it characteristically, during a walk with his friend Josef Rufer, when he said, \"I have made a discovery which will ensure the supremacy of German music for the next hundred years\" . This period included the \"Variations for Orchestra\", Op.\u00a031 (1928); \"Piano Pieces\", Opp.\u00a033a & b (1931), and the Piano Concerto, Op.\u00a042 (1942). Contrary to his reputation for strictness, Schoenberg's use of the technique varied widely according to the demands of each individual composition. Thus the structure of his unfinished opera \"Moses und Aron\" is unlike that of his \"Phantasy for Violin and Piano\", Op.\u00a047 (1949).\n", "In 1934 Tremblay\u2019s \"long-standing ambition\" to study under Arnold Schoenberg was realized when the composer emigrated from Europe to Los Angeles due to the rise of the Nazis under Adolf Hitler in 1933. Tremblay claims to have independently discovered the twelve-tone system of musical composition in the summer of 1933; upon telling Schoenberg, the master remarked that it was a natural thing to discover because it was the next logical development in tonality. Schoenberg, always willing to learn from his own students, supposedly was inspired to compose his \"Ode to Napoleon\" (1942) with a row of two symmetrical hexachords after hearing Tremblay\u2019s \"Modes of Transportation\" (1940) make use of a similar idea. Schoenberg is also reported to have been a great admirer of Tremblay\u2019s skill in improvising at the piano, claiming that \"[Tremblay] never plays a wrong note\" and advising him to simply write what he improvises. Tremblay and Schoenberg\u2019s friendship remained close and lasted until Schoenberg\u2019s death in 1951.\n", "In 1958, Miles Davis was one of many jazz musicians growing dissatisfied with bebop, seeing its increasingly complex chord changes as hindering musical creativity. Five years earlier, jazz pianist, composer and theorist George Russell published his \"Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization\" (1953), which offered an alternative to the practice of musical improvisation based on chords. Abandoning the traditional major and minor key relationships of classical music, Russell developed a new formulation using musical scales, or a series of scales, for improvisations. Russell's approach to improvisation came to be known as modal in jazz. Davis viewed Russell's methods of composition as a means of getting away from the dense chord-laden compositions of his time, which Davis had labeled as \"thick.\"\n", "Though the term was coined by Arnold Schoenberg, twentieth-century composer and inventor of the twelve-tone technique, he felt it was one of the most important compositional principles since around 1750:\n", "Though most sources will say it was invented by Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg in 1921 and first described privately to his associates in 1923, in fact Josef Matthias Hauer published his \"law of the twelve tones\" in 1919, and should be credited with inventing the technique, requiring that all twelve chromatic notes sound before any note is repeated.
