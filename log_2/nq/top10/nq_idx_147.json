They stabilize the double helix structure of DNA and contribute to the three-dimensional shapes of proteins, highlighting their fundamental role in life processes.\n\n5. **Variability in Hydrogen Bond Strength**: The strength of hydrogen bonds can vary significantly among different compounds. For example, hydrogen fluoride (HF) can form hydrogen bonds but is a weak acid compared to other hydrogen halides. This variability affects the physical and chemical properties of substances and their interactions.\n\n6. **Computational Insights**: Advances in computational chemistry have provided deeper insights into hydrogen bonding behavior across various compounds. These studies reveal that while hydrogen fluoride can form hydrogen bonds, the extent and impact of these interactions are not as pronounced as in water, emphasizing the need for context in evaluating hydrogen bonding.\n\n**Answer**: \nIn addition to water, several substances exhibit hydrogen bonding, including ethanol, acetic acid, acetamide, and methylamine. These compounds contain electronegative atoms and functional groups that facilitate hydrogen bonding. While water is unique in its ability to form four hydrogen bonds, leading to its distinctive properties, other compounds also participate in hydrogen bonding but may not exhibit the same structural and thermodynamic anomalies. Hydrogen bonding is crucial in biological systems, stabilizing structures like DNA and proteins, and its strength can vary significantly across different compounds.

However, they do not show anomalous thermodynamic, kinetic or structural properties like those observed in water because none of them can form four hydrogen bonds: either they cannot donate or accept hydrogen atoms, or there are steric effects in bulky residues.

This view is based upon neutron scattering studies and computer simulations, and it makes sense in the light of the unambiguously tetrahedral arrangement of water molecules in ice structures.\\n', 'Hydrogen bond\\n', 'A ubiquitous example of a hydrogen bond is found between water molecules. In a discrete water molecule, there are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Two molecules of water can form a hydrogen bond between them that is to say oxygen-hydrogen bonding; the simplest case, when only two molecules are present, is called the water dimer and is often used as a model system. When more molecules are present, as is the case with liquid water, more bonds are possible because the oxygen of one water molecule has two lone pairs of electrons, each of which can form a hydrogen bond with a hydrogen on another water molecule. This can repeat such that every water molecule is H-bonded with up to four other molecules, as shown in the figure (two through its two lone pairs, and two through its two hydrogen atoms). Hydrogen bonding strongly affects the crystal structure of ice, helping to create an open hexagonal lattice. The density of ice is less than the density of water at the same temperature; thus, the solid phase of water floats on the liquid, unlike most other substances.\\n', 'Hydrogen is noted for the different ways it forms bonds. It most commonly forms covalent bonds. It can lose its single valence electron in aqueous solution, leaving behind a bare proton with tremendous polarising power. This subsequently attaches itself to the lone electron pair of an oxygen atom in a water molecule, thereby forming the basis of acid-base chemistry. Under certain conditions a hydrogen atom in a molecule can form a second, weaker, bond with an atom or group of atoms in another molecule. Such bonding, \"helps give snowflakes their hexagonal symmetry, binds DNA into a double helix; shapes the three-dimensional forms of proteins; and even raises water\u2019s boiling point high enough to make a decent cup of tea.\"\\n', 'A molecular hydride may be able to bind to hydrogen molecules acting as a ligand.

Hydrogen atoms are covalently bonded to oxygen in a water molecule but also have an additional attraction (about 23.3\\xa0kJ/mol per hydrogen atom) to an adjacent oxygen atom in a separate molecule. These hydrogen bonds between water molecules hold them approximately 15% closer than what would be expected in a simple liquid with just van der Waals forces.\\n', \"A hydrogen bond (H-bond), is a specific type of interaction that involves dipole-dipole attraction between a partially positive hydrogen atom and a highly electronegative, partially negative oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, or fluorine atom (not covalently bound to said hydrogen atom). It is not a covalent bond, but instead is classified as a strong non-covalent interaction. It is responsible for why water is a liquid at room temperature and not a gas (given water's low molecular weight). Most commonly, the strength of hydrogen bonds lies between 0 - 4 kcal/mol, but can sometimes be as strong as 40 kcal/mol In solvents such as chloroform or carbontetrachloride one observes e.g. for the interaction between amides additive values of about 5 kJ/mol.

This fundamental concept is essential for understanding the unique properties of water and ice.\n\n### Answer:\nIn addition to water, several substances can form hydrogen bonds, including hydrogen fluoride (HF), ammonia (NH\u2083), methanol (CH\u2083OH), ethanol (C\u2082H\u2085OH), acetic acid (CH\u2083COOH), acetamide (CH\u2083CONH\u2082), and methylamine (CH\u2083NH\u2082). Hydrogen bonds are significant in biological structures, such as DNA and proteins, and they play a crucial role in the unique properties of water and ice."}], "question_info": {"question": "other than water what else has hydrogen bonds", "passages": ["A single water molecule can participate in a maximum of four hydrogen bonds because it can accept two bonds using the lone pairs on oxygen and donate two hydrogen atoms. Other molecules like hydrogen fluoride, ammonia and methanol can also form hydrogen bonds. However, they do not show anomalous thermodynamic, kinetic or structural properties like those observed in water because none of them can form four hydrogen bonds: either they cannot donate or accept hydrogen atoms, or there are steric effects in bulky residues. In water, intermolecular tetrahedral structures form due to the four hydrogen bonds, thereby forming an open structure and a three-dimensional bonding network, resulting in the anomalous decrease in density when cooled below 4\u00a0\u00b0C. This repeated, constantly reorganizing unit defines a three-dimensional network extending throughout the liquid. This view is based upon neutron scattering studies and computer simulations, and it makes sense in the light of the unambiguously tetrahedral arrangement of water molecules in ice structures.\n", "Hydrogen bond\n", "A ubiquitous example of a hydrogen bond is found between water molecules. In a discrete water molecule, there are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Two molecules of water can form a hydrogen bond between them that is to say oxygen-hydrogen bonding; the simplest case, when only two molecules are present, is called the water dimer and is often used as a model system. When more molecules are present, as is the case with liquid water, more bonds are possible because the oxygen of one water molecule has two lone pairs of electrons, each of which can form a hydrogen bond with a hydrogen on another water molecule. This can repeat such that every water molecule is H-bonded with up to four other molecules, as shown in the figure (two through its two lone pairs, and two through its two hydrogen atoms). Hydrogen bonding strongly affects the crystal structure of ice, helping to create an open hexagonal lattice. The density of ice is less than the density of water at the same temperature; thus, the solid phase of water floats on the liquid, unlike most other substances.\n", "Hydrogen is noted for the different ways it forms bonds. It most commonly forms covalent bonds. It can lose its single valence electron in aqueous solution, leaving behind a bare proton with tremendous polarising power. This subsequently attaches itself to the lone electron pair of an oxygen atom in a water molecule, thereby forming the basis of acid-base chemistry. Under certain conditions a hydrogen atom in a molecule can form a second, weaker, bond with an atom or group of atoms in another molecule. Such bonding, \"helps give snowflakes their hexagonal symmetry, binds DNA into a double helix; shapes the three-dimensional forms of proteins; and even raises water\u2019s boiling point high enough to make a decent cup of tea.\"\n", "A molecular hydride may be able to bind to hydrogen molecules acting as a ligand. The complexes are termed non-classical covalent hydrides. These complexes contain more hydrogen than the classical covalent hydrides, but are only stable at very low temperatures. They may be isolated in inert gas matrix, or as a cryogenic gas. Others have only been predicted using computational chemistry.\n", "All halogens form binary compounds with hydrogen known as the hydrogen halides: hydrogen fluoride (HF), hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen bromide (HBr), hydrogen iodide (HI), and hydrogen astatide (HAt). All of these compounds form acids when mixed with water. Hydrogen fluoride is the only hydrogen halide that forms hydrogen bonds. Hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, and hydroastatic acid are all strong acids, but hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid.\n", "Hydrogen has only one valence electron, but it can form bonds with more than one atom. In the bifluoride ion (), for example, it forms a three-center four-electron bond with two fluoride atoms: \n", "Water () is an oxide of hydrogen and the most familiar oxygen compound. Hydrogen atoms are covalently bonded to oxygen in a water molecule but also have an additional attraction (about 23.3\u00a0kJ/mol per hydrogen atom) to an adjacent oxygen atom in a separate molecule. These hydrogen bonds between water molecules hold them approximately 15% closer than what would be expected in a simple liquid with just van der Waals forces.\n", "A hydrogen bond (H-bond), is a specific type of interaction that involves dipole-dipole attraction between a partially positive hydrogen atom and a highly electronegative, partially negative oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, or fluorine atom (not covalently bound to said hydrogen atom). It is not a covalent bond, but instead is classified as a strong non-covalent interaction. It is responsible for why water is a liquid at room temperature and not a gas (given water's low molecular weight). Most commonly, the strength of hydrogen bonds lies between 0 - 4 kcal/mol, but can sometimes be as strong as 40 kcal/mol In solvents such as chloroform or carbontetrachloride one observes e.g. for the interaction between amides additive values of about 5 kJ/mol. According to L. Pauling the strength of a hydrogen bond is essentially determined by the electrostatic charges. Measurements of thousands complexes in chloroform or carbontetrachloride have led to additive free energy increments for all kind of donor-acceptor combinations.\n", "Hydrogen and chlorine were originally used as examples of univalent atoms, because of their nature to form only one single bond. Hydrogen has only one \"valence electron\" and can form only one bond with an atom that has an incomplete outer shell. Chlorine has seven \"valence electrons\" and can form only one bond with an atom that donates a \"valence electron\" to complete chlorine's outer shell. However, chlorine can also have oxidation states from +1 to +7 and can form more than one bond by donating \"valence electrons\".\n"], "__answers__": ["inorganic molecules such as water", "organic molecules like DNA and proteins"]}}
