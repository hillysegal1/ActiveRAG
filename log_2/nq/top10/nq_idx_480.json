This transition is significant as it reflects the character's evolution from a younger child to a relatable teenager, which Marsden, being a high school student at the time, was able to embody effectively. \n\nThe discussion highlights several important aspects of voice acting and character representation. Firstly, the distinction between speaking and singing voices is crucial; while Marsden provided the speaking voice, Aaron Lohr was responsible for Max's singing voice. This duality raises interesting questions about audience perception and character identity, as it can create a layered representation of Max that resonates with viewers on different levels.\n\nMoreover, the panel noted that the casting of youthful actors for teenage roles was a trend in the 1990s animation landscape, enhancing authenticity and relatability. Marsden's portrayal of Max captures the character's internal conflict between wanting to fit in and dealing with the quirks of his father, Goofy. This theme of identity struggle is particularly relevant to the target audience of the film, many of whom may relate to the pressures of adolescence.\n\nAdditionally, the musical contributions of Tevin Campbell as Powerline further enrich Max's character.
