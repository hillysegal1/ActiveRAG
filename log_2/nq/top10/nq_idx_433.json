They played in the National League for over 50 years, becoming a well-known franchise within that league.\n\n2. **Transition Year**: The significant change occurred in 2013. This transition was part of a larger realignment in MLB aimed at balancing the number of teams in each league.

The Astros' move to the American League was intended to create two leagues with 15 teams each.\n\n3. **Ownership Change**: The transition was also linked to the sale of the team from Drayton McLane to Jim Crane.

However, in 2013, the Astros transitioned to the American League. This move was not an isolated decision; it was influenced by several interconnected factors:\n\n1. **Final Season in National League**: The Astros' last season in the National League was 2012, marking the end of a long tenure in that league.\n\n2. **Ownership Change**: The transition was closely linked to the sale of the team from Drayton McLane to Jim Crane. This ownership change was a significant catalyst for the decision to move leagues.\n\n3. **Effective Move**: The Astros agreed to make the transition effective in the 2013 season, indicating a planned and strategic approach to the change.\n\n4. **League Assignment**: Upon their move, the Astros were assigned to the American League West division, where they joined their in-state rivals, the Texas Rangers. This assignment was part of the league's effort to balance team distribution across divisions.\n\n5. **Reason for Move**: The shift was part of a broader strategy initiated by Major League Baseball to expand interleague play. Commissioner Bud Selig's desire for more frequent interleague contests necessitated an adjustment in league structures, leading to the Astros' move.\n\n6. **Balancing Teams**: The transition also aimed to balance the number of teams in each league, as the American League had one more team than the National League at that time. This balance was important for scheduling and competitive fairness.\n\n### Enhanced Causal Reasoning:\n- The model can now recognize that the Astros' move was not merely a change of league but a multifaceted decision influenced by ownership dynamics, league policies, and competitive balance.\n- Understanding the sequence of events (ownership change leading to a league transition) helps establish a clearer timeline for the model, improving its ability to infer causality.\n- The model can also appreciate the broader implications of such a move, including how it affects team rivalries, scheduling, and the overall structure of Major League Baseball.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy integrating these insights, the model can better understand the complexity of organizational decisions in sports, enhancing its causal reasoning and logical inference capabilities.\n\n### Answer:\nThe Houston Astros changed from the National League to the American League in 2013, following their last season in the National League in 2012. This transition was influenced by a change in ownership and was part of a broader strategy to expand interleague play and balance the number of teams in each league."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhen did the astros change from the national league to the american league\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The Major League Baseball postseason was expanded to include a second wild card team in each league beginning in the 2012 season.
