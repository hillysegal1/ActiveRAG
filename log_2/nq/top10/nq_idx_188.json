Initially, popcorn was a popular street food and was often sold at fairs. The Great Depression played a significant role in solidifying popcorn's place in cinemas, as it was an inexpensive snack that could be easily made and sold, appealing to the economic conditions of the time.\n\nIn the 1920s, theater owners began to recognize the potential of popcorn as a profitable snack to increase their revenues. The sound of popping corn and its enticing aroma attracted customers, leading to its growing popularity in movie theaters. By the 1930s, popcorn had become a staple snack in cinemas.\n\nKey figures in this development include **Charles Cretors**, who invented the first popcorn machine in 1885. His steam-powered machines made it easier to produce popcorn in large quantities, significantly increasing its accessibility. Cretors introduced popcorn to movie theaters in New York during the 1930s, which helped establish popcorn as a popular snack during film screenings.\n\nAnother important figure is **Samuel M. Rubin**, known as \"Sam the Popcorn Man.\" He is credited with the mass introduction of popcorn machines to cinemas in the 1930s after observing popcorn being made in Oklahoma City. While there is some uncertainty about whether he was the first to sell popcorn in theaters, he is widely recognized for popularizing the practice.\n\nThe commercialization of popcorn continued to grow, with the establishment of companies like the **Popped-Right Corn Company** in 1948, which focused on selling ready-to-eat popcorn to theaters. This indicates a significant market interest in popcorn as a movie snack.\n\nOverall, while there isn't a single person who can be credited with the idea of selling popcorn at the movies, it was a combination of innovations by entrepreneurs like Cretors and Rubin, along with the changing cultural landscape during the Great Depression, that led to popcorn becoming a beloved movie theater snack.\n\n### Answer:\nPopcorn became popular at movies in the early 20th century, particularly during the 1930s, due to its affordability and appeal. Key figures like Charles Cretors, who invented the first popcorn machine, and Samuel M. Rubin, who helped introduce popcorn machines to cinemas, played significant roles in this development.

The Great Depression made popcorn an attractive option for theaters due to its low cost and high profit margins.\n\n2. **Technological Innovation**:\n   - Charles Cretors invented the first popcorn machine in 1885, which allowed for the commercial production of popcorn. This innovation was crucial as it enabled theaters to serve freshly popped popcorn, enhancing the movie-going experience.\n\n3. **Key Individuals**:\n   - Samuel M. Rubin, known as \"Sam the Popcorn Man,\" played a significant role in popularizing popcorn in cinemas during the 1950s. He was inspired by observing popcorn being made in Oklahoma City around 1930 and recognized its potential as a profitable snack for theaters.\n\n4. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - The introduction of Cretors' popcorn machine led to the commercialization of popcorn, which was then embraced by theater owners as a means to increase profits. Rubin's efforts further popularized popcorn in theaters, solidifying its status as a staple snack.\n\n5. **Complexity of Causation**:\n   - While Cretors and Rubin are significant figures in the history of popcorn in theaters, the transition to popcorn as a movie snack involved multiple entrepreneurs and theater owners who recognized its potential. This illustrates the complexity of causation, where various factors and individuals contribute to a cultural shift.\n\n6. **Cultural and Economic Factors**:\n   - The rise of popcorn in theaters reflects broader economic trends and changing consumer preferences. The sensory appeal of popcorn\u2014the sound of popping and the smell\u2014also played a role in attracting customers to theaters.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe enhanced reasoning process incorporates a broader historical context, emphasizes the role of technological innovation, and acknowledges the contributions of multiple individuals.
