The most renowned record is held by Wilt Chamberlain, who scored 100 points on March 2, 1962, in a game against the New York Knicks. This record is not only a statistical achievement but also a cultural milestone in sports history, often regarded as one of the greatest individual performances in any sport.\n\nChamberlain's 100-point game is remarkable not just for the sheer number of points but also because he set five other records during that game, including the most free throws made.

The most prominent record is held by Wilt Chamberlain, who scored 100 points in a game on March 2, 1962, for the Philadelphia Warriors against the New York Knicks. This performance not only set the NBA single-game scoring record but also remains unmatched to this day. The game itself ended with a combined score of 316 points, which was a record for the most combined points in a game at that time.\n\nIn addition to Chamberlain's record, other significant high-scoring performances include Kobe Bryant, who scored 81 points in a game against the Toronto Raptors on January 22, 2006. This performance is the second-highest in NBA history, illustrating the rarity and difficulty of achieving such high scores. Additionally, the highest-scoring regular-season game occurred on December 13, 1983, when the Detroit Pistons defeated the Denver Nuggets 186-184 in triple overtime, with Kiki Vandeweghe scoring 51 points.\n\nUnderstanding these records allows us to identify causal relationships in basketball scoring. For instance, Chamberlain's 100-point game is not only a testament to his individual skill but also reflects the game strategies and conditions of that era, such as the lack of a three-point line and different fouling tactics. This historical context enhances our understanding of how player performances can lead to significant milestones in sports history.\n\nBy comparing these performances, we can infer patterns in scoring trends and the impact of game dynamics on individual achievements.

That season, Chamberlain averaged a record 50.4 points per game, and he had broken the NBA single-game scoring record (71) earlier in the season in December with 78 points. The third-year center had already set season scoring records in his first two seasons. In the fourth quarter, the Knicks began fouling other players to keep the ball away from Chamberlain, and they also became deliberate on offense to reduce the number of possessions for Philadelphia. The Warriors countered by committing fouls of their own to get the ball back. \n", "During the 1983\u201384 Nuggets season, VanDeWeghe scored 50 or more points in two NBA record-setting games.
