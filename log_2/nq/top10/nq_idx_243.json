This song was written by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen and has become a jazz standard.

The juxtaposition of these two phrases highlights how music transcends cultural boundaries and how traditional Western jazz standards can find resonance in modern global pop music.\n\n**Expert 3: Linguist**\nFrom a linguistic standpoint, the phrase \"Come and dance with me\" and \"Jai Ho\" serve different functions in their respective contexts.
