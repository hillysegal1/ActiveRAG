Their historical performance is crucial for understanding their legacy in the tournament.\n\n3. **Consecutive Wins**: To answer the question of how many times Real Madrid has won the Champions League in a row, we need to examine their record:\n   - **First Instance**: Real Madrid won the Champions League five consecutive times from 1955-56 to 1959-60. This achievement is significant as it remains the record for the most consecutive victories in the tournament's history.\n   - **Second Instance**: More recently, Real Madrid won the Champions League three times in a row from 2015-16 to 2017-18. This accomplishment marked them as the first team to achieve three consecutive titles since the tournament's rebranding, highlighting their sustained excellence in a more competitive environment.\n\n4. **Comparative Significance**: While the five consecutive titles from the 1950s set a historical benchmark, the three consecutive titles in the modern era demonstrate Real Madrid's ability to adapt and succeed amidst evolving challenges in football. This duality of achievement showcases their consistent performance across different eras.\n\n5. **Broader Implications**: Real Madrid's success is not solely about the number of titles won. It reflects their strong organizational structure, financial resources, and capacity to attract top talent, which have contributed to their global popularity and influence in football.\n\n6. **Expert Consensus and Divergence**: Experts agree on the significance of both the five consecutive titles and the three-peat, but there is a nuanced discussion regarding their relative importance. Some emphasize the foundational nature of the 1950s victories, while others highlight the challenges of modern football, suggesting that recent successes are equally noteworthy.\n\n**Conclusion**: In light of the enriched synthesis of expert insights, it is clear that Real Madrid has achieved remarkable success in the Champions League. They have won the tournament five times in a row from 1955-56 to 1959-60, which remains the record for consecutive victories.

Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup. Real Madrid\u2019s title was its 12th, extending its record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as \"La Duod\u00e9cima\". Real Madrid won their third title in a row in 2018 against Liverpool in Kiev, beating them 3-1. It was a match to forget for Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius who made two errors during the match: he performed a wayward throw which rebounded off Karim Benzema for Real Madrid\u2019s first goal. Then, following a great overhead bicycle kick by Gareth Bale for the Spaniards\u2019 second, he mishandled a long-range shot by Bale for Real Madrid\u2019s third.\n", "Real Madrid became the first team since Bayern Munich in 1974\u201376 to win three consecutive UEFA Champions Leagues or European Cups. The title was Madrid's 13th, another Champions League record, and their fourth in five years.

They have scored at least one goal in 34 consecutive games. The run started with a 1\u20131 draw against Barcelona in the second leg of the semi-final of the 2010\u201311 season. This continued with all 12 matches of both the 2011\u201312 season and 2012\u201313 season, and continued into the 2013\u201314 season for nine games (six group stage games, both legs of the round of 16 and the first leg of the quarter-finals), with the run finally coming to an end in a 2\u20130 away loss in the quarter-finals second leg against Borussia Dortmund on 8 April 2014.\n", "In the modern era, the Madrid derby is the second biggest derby in Spanish football, behind El Cl\u00e1sico, and although Real Madrid have the larger worldwide fanbase, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid have also amassed a significant worldwide support, due to their level of success in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League in the early 21st century.

Atl\u00e9tico have never won the Champions League, though they have reached the final on three occasions (losing narrowly to Real Madrid in two of those), and they have also won the Europa League three times since 2010 (compared to two UEFA Cups for Real Madrid in the 1980s) and the UEFA Super Cup three times (one of them against Real Madrid).\n", "The European Cup was inaugurated in 1955, with Real Madrid winning the first five editions.
