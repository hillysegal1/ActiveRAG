This establishes a competitive context where multiple candidates vie for the opportunity to host the prestigious event.\n\n2. **Selection of Host City**: The International Olympic Committee (IOC) selected Pyeongchang as the host city on July 6, 2011. Pyeongchang received 63 votes, significantly more than Munich's 25 votes and Annecy's 7 votes. This voting outcome illustrates a clear preference among IOC members for Pyeongchang, which is crucial for understanding the decision-making process.\n\n3. **Historical Context**: Pyeongchang had previously bid for the Winter Olympics twice before its successful bid in 2011. This historical context is important as it demonstrates persistence and the potential influence of previous experiences on the final decision.\n\n4. **Causal Relationships**: The information indicates a cause-and-effect relationship: the number of votes received directly influenced the selection of the host city. A higher vote count correlates with a greater likelihood of being chosen, which is a key insight for understanding competitive selection processes.\n\n5. **Comparative Analysis**: By comparing the bids and their outcomes, we can infer that factors such as prior bidding experience and the ability to garner support from IOC members are critical in competitive scenarios. This comparative analysis can be applied to various contexts beyond the Olympics, such as elections or project proposals.\n\n6. **Implications for Future Bids**: Understanding the dynamics of this selection process can inform future bidders about the importance of building a strong case for support, learning from past attempts, and effectively engaging with decision-makers.\n\n### Answer:\nPyeongchang, South Korea hosted the 2018 Winter Olympics. The host city was selected by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on July 6, 2011, after Pyeongchang received 63 votes, surpassing Munich's 25 votes and Annecy's 7 votes.
