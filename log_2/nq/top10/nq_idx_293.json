However, we should also consider the song's themes of love and longing. A character who favors 'Blueberry Hill' could be someone who has experienced a significant romantic relationship or loss. The song's lyrics evoke a sense of yearning, which could be reflected in the character's backstory. This adds emotional depth and allows us to explore how music can shape personal identity.\"\n\n**Expert 3: Literary Scholar**\n\"Building on both points, I think we should also examine the broader context of the song's history.
