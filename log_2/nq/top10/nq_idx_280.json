However, during the 1970s, many states lowered their drinking ages to 18 in response to the 26th Amendment, which lowered the voting age to 18. This shift was influenced by a societal belief that if individuals were deemed mature enough to vote, they should also be allowed to consume alcohol.\n\n2. **Rising Concerns**:\n   - By the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a growing concern about the increase in alcohol-related accidents and fatalities among young people. This led to advocacy for raising the drinking age as a public health measure.\n\n3. **Legislative Action**:\n   - In 1984, the U.S. Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which mandated that all states raise and enforce the legal drinking age to 21. The act included a significant incentive: states that did not comply would face a reduction of up to 10% in federal highway funds, creating a strong financial motivation for states to adopt the new law.\n\n4. **State Compliance**:\n   - States began to comply with the new federal mandate, with many raising their drinking ages to 21 by the deadline of October 1986. By mid-1988, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had complied, although some territories like Puerto Rico and Guam did not follow suit immediately.\n\n5. **Contemporary Issues**:\n   - The legal drinking age of 21 remains a contentious issue, with ongoing debates about its appropriateness compared to the age of majority (18) and drinking ages in other countries. Some states have proposed legislation to lower the drinking age, reflecting the ongoing societal discourse surrounding this issue.\n\n6. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - The reasoning process illustrates a clear cause-and-effect relationship: the passage of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act led to a nationwide increase in the legal drinking age due to both public health concerns and financial incentives for states.\n\n7. **Temporal and Comparative Analysis**:\n   - The timeline of changes in the drinking age, including historical context and specific dates, allows for an understanding of how events are interrelated over time. The model can also analyze why some states complied sooner than others and the implications of those decisions.\n\n8. **Debate and Legislative Influence**:\n   - The complexities of public policy and societal norms surrounding the drinking age can enhance the model's ability to reason about conflicting viewpoints and the factors that contribute to policy decisions. The hierarchical nature of governance in the U.S. demonstrates how federal legislation can influence state laws.\n\n### Answer:\nThe legal drinking age in the United States changed to 21 with the passage of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act in 1984. This act mandated that all states raise their minimum legal drinking age to 21 by October 1986, and by mid-1988, all states had complied with this mandate. The change was driven by rising concerns about alcohol-related accidents among young people and was enforced through financial incentives tied to federal highway funding."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhen did the legal drinking age changed to 21\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['In response to the National Minimum Drinking Age Act in 1984, which reduced by up to 10% the federal highway funding of any state which did not have a minimum purchasing age of 21, the New York Legislature raised the drinking age from 19 to 21, effective December 1, 1985.
