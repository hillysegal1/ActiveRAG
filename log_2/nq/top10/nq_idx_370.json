This can help the model develop a more nuanced understanding of how singular events can have far-reaching consequences.\n\n### Answer:\nThe Aurora shooting occurred on July 20, 2012, during a midnight screening of \"The Dark Knight Rises\" at Theater 9 in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado. The shooter, James Holmes, opened fire, resulting in the deaths of 12 individuals and injuries to 58 others.
