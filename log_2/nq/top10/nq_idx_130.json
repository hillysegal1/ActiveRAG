This would be the equivalent of observing daylight savings time year-round for the Eastern time zone. The benefit of this option is that it would not need a congressional vote, instead these state proposals could be approved by the federal Department of Transportation.

The Central Time counties officially observed Daylight Saving Time. Interests for both time zones had prevented the official adoption of daylight saving since the 1960s, leading to decades of debate. Daniels pressed for the entire state to switch to Central Time, but the General Assembly could not come to terms.

This practice is intended to make better use of daylight during the longer days of summer.\n\n2. **States that Do Not Observe DST**: \n   - The two U.S. states that do not observe DST are **Arizona** and **Hawaii**. Arizona's exception is the Navajo Nation, which does observe DST. This distinction is important as it highlights that not all regions within a state may follow the same time observance rules.\n   - Additionally, several U.S. territories, including American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands, also do not observe DST.\n\n3. **Geographical and Cultural Factors**: The decision for states like Arizona and Hawaii to opt out of DST is influenced by geographical location and climate. For example, Arizona's hot climate means that extending daylight into the evening does not provide the same benefits as it might in cooler regions. Hawaii, being closer to the equator, experiences relatively consistent daylight hours year-round, making DST less relevant.\n\n4. **Historical Context**: Prior to 2006, most of Indiana did not observe DST, but the entire state has been observing it since then. This historical context illustrates how state policies regarding DST can change over time due to legislative actions or public sentiment.\n\n5. **Legislative Proposals**: Some states, particularly in New England (like Delaware, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut), have proposed legislation to adopt year-round \"Atlantic Standard Time\" to avoid the biannual clock changes associated with DST. This indicates ongoing discussions about the relevance and practicality of DST in various regions.\n\n6. **Federal Legislation**: The Uniform Time Act of 1966 established a framework for DST in the U.S., allowing states to opt out. This federal law is significant as it provides the legal basis for states to choose whether or not to observe DST.\n\n7. **Local Customs**: The mention of local customs in Indiana, where some counties unofficially observed DST before statewide adoption, highlights that local practices can sometimes differ from state laws, reflecting community preferences and historical practices.\n\n### Answer:\nThe states that do not observe Daylight Saving Time are **Arizona** (except for the Navajo Nation) and **Hawaii**.

This practice is not universally adopted across all states in the U.S.\n\n2. **States Opting Out of DST**: Certain states have opted out of observing DST due to various factors, including geographical considerations, public preference, and legislative decisions. The states that do not observe DST are typically those where the time change does not significantly impact daylight hours.\n\n3. **Identifying Non-DST States**: The primary states that do not observe Daylight Saving Time are:\n   - **Arizona**: Most of Arizona does not observe DST, with the notable exception of the Navajo Nation, which does observe it.\n   - **Hawaii**: Hawaii has chosen to remain on standard time year-round and does not observe DST.\n   - **Other Territories**: Additionally, U.S. territories such as American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands also do not observe DST.\n\n4. **Historical Context**: \n   - Prior to 2006, most of Indiana did not observe DST, but it now observes it statewide.\n   - Between 1945 and 1966, there was no federal law mandating DST, allowing localities to choose their observance, which indicates that DST practices can change based on legislative and public sentiment.\n\n5. **Legislative Proposals**: Some states, particularly in New England, have proposed legislation to adopt year-round Atlantic Standard Time, effectively opting out of DST. Washington state has also enacted a bill for year-round DST pending congressional approval, with an alternative proposal for year-round Mountain Standard Time without DST.\n\n6. **Causal Relationships and Implications**: Understanding the reasons behind states opting out of DST can enhance the model's ability to infer potential future changes in time observance practices. For instance, if public sentiment shifts or if legislative proposals gain traction, states may reconsider their stance on DST.\n\n7. **Comparative Analysis**: By analyzing the differences between states that observe DST and those that do not, the model can develop a more nuanced understanding of regional preferences and the factors influencing these decisions. This comparative analysis can improve the model's inferential capabilities regarding time observance practices.\n\n### Answer:\nThe states that do not observe Daylight Saving Time are Arizona (except for the Navajo Nation) and Hawaii.
