The design of the Intel 4004 began in April 1970 when Federico Faggin joined Intel, taking over the project from Marcian Hoff. This highlights the collaborative nature of the invention and the importance of multiple contributors, including Masatoshi Shima, who assisted in the logic design.\n\n5. The term \"central processing unit\" has been used in the computer industry since the early 1960s, and the evolution of CPU designs has included the integration of control units and arithmetic logic units (ALUs). This historical context is essential for understanding the development of CPUs and their components.\n\n6. Additionally, the establishment of Cambridge Processor Unit Ltd. by Curry and Hauser in 1978 indicates that there were other entities pursuing microprocessor technology during this period, contributing to the broader landscape of CPU development.\n\nBy incorporating these details, we can provide a more nuanced understanding of the history and development of CPUs, reducing the likelihood of oversimplified or inaccurate narratives.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe central processing unit (CPU) was developed through contributions from various engineers and companies, with the first commercially available microprocessor, the Intel 4004, being developed by Intel in 1971.

He discussed the concept at a brainstorming meeting that was held in Japan. Sasaki attributes the basic invention to break the chipset of a calculator into four parts with ROM (4001), RAM (4002), shift registers (4003) and CPU (4004) to an unnamed woman, a software engineering researcher from Nara Women's College, who was present at the meeting. Sasaki then had his first meeting with Noyce in 1968. Sasaki discussed the microprocessor concept with Busicom and Intel in 1968, and presented the woman's four-division chipset concept to Intel and Busicom. This provided the basis for the single-chip microprocessor design of the Intel 4004. He was also involved in the development of the Busicom 141-PF desktop calculator which led to the 4004's creation. Sasaki thus played a key role in the creation of the first microprocessor.\n", "Curry and Hauser had become increasingly interested in the idea of selling their own computers and so, on 5 December 1978, they set up Cambridge Processor Unit Ltd (CPU). Their first customer was Ace Coin Equipment Ltd, who needed controllers for their fruit machines.\n", "Curry and Hauser decided to pursue their joint interest in microcomputers and, on 5 December 1978, they set up Cambridge Processor Unit Ltd. (CPU) as the vehicle with which to do this. CPU soon obtained a consultancy contract to develop a microprocessor-based controller for a fruit machine for Ace Coin Equipment (ACE) of Wales. The ACE project was started at office space obtained at 4a Market Hill in Cambridge. Initially, the ACE controller was based on a National Semiconductor SC/MP microprocessor, but soon the switch to a MOS Technology 6502 was made.\n", "Soon designs integrated the control unit and ALU into what became known as the central processing unit (CPU).\n", "A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor or main processor, is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term \"central processing unit\" at least since the early 1960s. Traditionally, the term \"CPU\" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.\n", "BULLET::::- Central processing unit \u2013 (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.

Traditionally, the term \"CPU\" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.\n", "By the late 1960s, designers were striving to integrate the central processing unit (CPU) functions of a computer onto a handful of very-large-scale integration metal-oxide semiconductor chips, called microprocessor unit (MPU) chipsets. Building on an earlier Busicom design from 1969, Intel introduced the first commercial microprocessor, the 4-bit Intel 4004, in 1971, followed by its 8-bit microprocessor 8008 in 1972. In 1969, Lee Boysel, based on the 8-bit arithmetic logic units (3800/3804) he designed earlier at Fairchild, created the Four-Phase Systems Inc. AL-1, an 8-bit CPU slice that was expandable to 32-bits. In 1970, Steve Geller and Ray Holt of Garrett AiResearch designed the MP944 chipset to implement the F-14A Central Air Data Computer on six metal-gate chips fabricated by AMI.\n", "The Intel 4004 is a 4-bit central processing unit (CPU) released by Intel Corporation in 1971. It was the first commercially available microprocessor, and the first in a long line of Intel CPUs. The silicon design only started in April 1970, when Federico Faggin joined Intel. Until then, the architectural proposal by Marcian Hoff had been idling without further development. Faggin took over the project and led it to its successful completion in January 1971. Masatoshi Shima participated in the architectural phase with Hoff and, later, in the logic design, helping Faggin to speed up the development.\n", "In the 1980s, Moore turned his attention and Forth development techniques to CPU design, developing several stack machine microprocessors and gaining several microprocessor-related patents along the way. His designs have all emphasized high performance at low power usage. He also explored alternate Forth architectures such as cmForth and machine Forth, which more closely matched his chips' machine languages.\n", "In his early career days, he worked at Pye, Royal Radar Establishment and W.R Grace Laboratories. Then, in April 1966 he joined Sinclair Radionics where he worked for 13 years. He was involved with their hifi products and their electric vehicle. In 1972, he helped Sinclair Radionics to launch its first electronic calculator, the Executive. He set up Cambridge Processor Unit Ltd. (CPU) in December 1978. Their first product was the Acorn Microcomputer (later called the System 1).\n"], "__answers__": ["John von Neumann"]}}
