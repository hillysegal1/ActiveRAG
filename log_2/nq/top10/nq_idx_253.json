This character adds a layer of innocence and friendship to the narrative, showcasing the lighter side of jungle life. His role, voiced by Clint Howard in the original film and by Jimmy Bennett in \"The Jungle Book 2,\" emphasizes the playful and adventurous spirit of childhood.\n\n**Expert 2: The Literary Context**\nWhile I agree with Expert 1 about Hathi Jr. being a notable character, I would like to draw attention to the broader literary context of elephants in children's literature, such as in Kamala Laxman's \"The Thama Stories.\" These stories feature a baby elephant and explore themes of adventure and family, which resonate with the character of Hathi Jr. This connection suggests that the portrayal of baby elephants in literature often embodies innocence and the journey of growth, which is a universal theme.\n\n**Expert 3: The Character Dynamics**\nI appreciate the insights from both experts, but I want to focus on the character dynamics involving Hathi Jr. and his father, Hathi.
