Besides being governor of Egypt, he was also the tax-collector of the province, and most likely resided in Faiyum.

Subsequently, he leads a Roman army South of the First Cataract of the Nile for the first time. He establishes a puppet-state called \"Triacontaschoenos\" under a local petty king to act as a buffer-zone between Egypt and Aethiopia (i.e. the kingdom of Aksum), as well as a loose protectorate over Ethiopia itself. Despite his success, Gallus incurs Augustus' displeasure by erecting monuments to himself and is recalled to Rome, tried by the Senate and convicted of various unspecified charges and banished.\n", "After hearing about the overthrow of the governor Koca H\u00fcsrev Mehmed Pasha in 1803, Ali Pasha asked to be made the governor of Egypt, even though it appeared as though the Albanian troops had taken control of the province from the Ottomans.
