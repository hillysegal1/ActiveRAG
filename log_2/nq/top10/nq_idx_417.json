This form of the Mass remained largely unchanged until the reforms initiated by Vatican II in the 1960s.

The Council's decisions, particularly from 1964 onwards, allowed for a gradual shift towards the vernacular.

The sudden apparent \"outlawing\" of the 400-year-old Mass, the last typical edition of which being promulgated only a few years earlier in 1962 by Paul's predecessor, Pope John XXIII, was not always explained well. Further experimentation with the new Mass by liturgists, such as the usage of pop/folk music (as opposed to the Gregorian Chant advocated by Pope Pius X), along with concurrent changes in the order of sanctuaries, was viewed by some as vandalism. In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI clarified that the 1962 Mass of John XXIII and the 1970 Mass of Paul VI are two forms of the same Roman Rite, the first, which had never been \"juridically abrogated\", now being an \"extraordinary form of the Roman Rite\", while the other \"obviously is and continues to be the normal Form \u2013 the Forma ordinaria \u2013 of the Eucharistic Liturgy\".\n", "The term \"Mass\" is derived from the concluding words of the Roman Rite Mass in Latin: \"\"Ite, missa est\"\" (\"Go; it is the dismissal\"). The Late Latin word \"missa\" substantively corresponds to the classical Latin word \"missio\". In antiquity, \"missa\" simply meant \"dismissal\". In Christian usage, however, it gradually took on a deeper meaning. The word \"dismissal\" has come to imply a mission.\n", "Neither the Second Vatican Council nor the subsequent revision of the Roman Missal abolished Latin as the liturgical language of the Roman Rite: the official text of the Roman Missal, on which translations into vernacular languages are to be based, continues to be in Latin, and Latin can still be used in the celebration. The term \"Latin Mass\" is sometimes applied to such celebrations, which in some places are part of the normal Sunday schedule.\n", "In 1965 and 1967 some changes were officially introduced into the Mass of the Roman Rite in the wake of \"Sacrosanctum Concilium\", but no new edition of the Roman Missal had been produced to incorporate them. They were reflected in the provisional vernacular translations produced in various countries when the language of the people began to be used in addition to Latin. References sometimes met in an English-language context to \"the 1965 Missal\" concern these temporary vernacular productions, not the Roman Missal itself. Some countries that had the same language used different translations and varied in the amount of vernacular admitted.\n", "Accordingly, in order to implement a decision of that council, he standardised the Holy Mass by promulgating the 1570 edition of the Roman Missal. Pius V made this Missal mandatory throughout the Latin rite of the Catholic Church, except where a Mass liturgy dating from before 1370 AD was in use. This form of the Mass remained essentially unchanged for 400 years until Pope Paul VI's revision of the Roman Missal in 1969\u201370, after which it has become widely known as the Tridentine Mass; use of the last pre-1969 edition of the Missal, that by Pope John XXIII in 1962, is permitted without limitation for private celebration of the Mass and, since July 2007, is allowed also for public use, as laid down in the motu proprio \"Summorum Pontificum\" of Pope Benedict XVI. Some continue to use even earlier editions, but without authorisation.\n"], "__answers__": ["1967", "from 1967 onwards"]}}
