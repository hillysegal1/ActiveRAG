Since Hawaii is the state that followed Alaska in admission, it confirms that Hawaii is indeed the last state to achieve statehood.\n\n4. **Comparative Analysis**: The model can compare the admission dates of the last two states (Alaska and Hawaii) to reinforce the understanding that Hawaii is the most recent addition to the United States.\n\n5. **Causal Connections**: The admission of states is part of a broader historical narrative. Understanding that Hawaii's admission occurred after Alaska helps the model grasp the significance of these events in the context of U.S. history.\n\n6. **Inference from Ambiguity**: While there may be complexities in the historical records of other states, the clear and unambiguous dates for Alaska and Hawaii simplify the reasoning process for identifying the last state.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy consolidating the extracted information and enhancing the reasoning process, the model can improve its causal reasoning and logical inference capabilities. It can better understand the relationships between events, the significance of temporal order, and the nuances of historical narratives.\n\n### Answer:\nHawaii became a state on August 21, 1959, making it the last state to join the United States."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhen did the last state became a state\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['became a state.\\n', 'Louisiana became a state in 1812.\\n', 'The Delta became state on 3 August 1991.\\n', 'become a state until one year later in 1889.\\n', 'In September 1850, California became the 31st state of the United States.\\n', 'Alaska became the 49th state of the United States on January 3, 1959.\\n', 'On November 11, 1889 Washington became a state.\\n', 'BULLET::::- Ohio was admitted as a state, having previously been a portion of the Northwest Territory.
