It was built in the 1650 by Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reign, 1628-1658) near his hunting lodge in Hasthal. The three storeyed tower is 16.87 meters (55 feet) tall and stands on a raised octagonal platform. The minar is built with bricks and clad with red sandstone. The tower structure and design resembles the Qutub Minar of Delhi and was inspired by it.\n", "The Qutb complex are monuments and buildings from the Delhi Sultanate at Mehrauli in Delhi in India. The Qutub Minar \"victory tower\" in the complex, named after the religious figure Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki, was begun by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, who later became the first Sultan of Delhi of the Mamluk dynasty. Construction was continued by his successor Iltutmish (a.k.a. Altamash), and finally completed much later by Firoz Shah Tughlaq, a Sultan of Delhi from the Tughlaq dynasty in 1368 AD. The Qubbat-ul-Islam Mosque (Dome of Islam), later corrupted into Quwwat-ul Islam, stands next to the Qutb Minar.\n", "Following the formation of local government by the United Front in April 1954, the anniversary of 21 February was declared a holiday and it became possible to construct the new monument. A foundation stone was laid in 1956. Sculptor Hamidur Rahman created the design of Shaheed Minar under which construction was started in 1957. Hamidur Rahman's model was a huge complex on a large area of land in the yard of Dhaka Medical College Hostel. The enormous design included a half-circular column to symbolise the mother with her fallen sons standing on the monument's central dais. Yellow and deep blue pieces of stained glass, symbolising eyes reflecting the sun, were also to be placed in the columns. The marble floor was designed to reflect the moving shadows of the columns. The basement of the Minar also included a fresco depicting the history of the language movement. A railing decorated with Bengali alphabet was to be constructed in front. Two footmarks coloured red and black, indicating the two opposite forces, were also in the design. Besides this a museum and a library were also included in Hamidur Rahman's design. A fountain shaped like an eye was also to be constructed. Rahman specifically designed the materials of the monument to withstand the area's tropical climate.\n", "Qutb ud Din Aibak, founder of the Delhi Sultanate, started construction of the Qutb Minar's first storey around 1192. In 1220, Aibak's successor and son-in-law Shamsuddin Iltutmish completed a further three storeys. In 1369, a lightning strike destroyed the top storey. Firoz Shah Tughlaq replaced the damaged storey, and added one more. Sher Shah Suri also added an entrance to this tower while he was ruling and Humayun was in exile.\n", "BULLET::::- 1190s \u2013 Construction of Qutub Minar started in India\n", "Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poem \"The Qutub Minar, Delhi\" is a reflection on an engraving in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1833.\n", "The Mini Qutub Minar structure is similar to Qutub Minar in Delhi. It originally consisted of five storeys, each with a reducing diameter. A narrow staircase built inside led to the top. Each storey is surrounded by an octagonal ring in the outside with red sandstone overhanging eves (Chhajja) like in the Qutub Minar. The minar is built using Lakhori bricks.\n", "In the early 17th century, Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan used Hastsal as one of his hunting lodges. In 1650, he commissioned the construction of a tall minaret similar to Qutub Minar in Delhi. When completed, the Mini Qutub Minar was much higher than it is now. It was a tall 5 storey tower with an internal stairway leading to the domed Chhatri pavilion at the top. It was a gorgeous hunting pavilion tower in the center of an encompassing wilderness. The emperor rested in the tower top, royally-entertained with his immediate retinue after hunting in the surrounding wilderness.\n", "The minar's topmost storey was damaged by lightning in 1369 and was rebuilt by Firuz Shah Tughlaq, who added another storey. In 1505, an earthquake damaged Qutub Minar; it was repaired by Sikander Lodi. On 1 September 1803, a major earthquake caused serious damage. Major Robert Smith of the British Indian Army renovated the tower in 1828 and installed a pillared cupola over the fifth storey, thus creating a sixth. The cupola was taken down in 1848, under instructions from The Viscount Hardinge, then Governor General of India. It was reinstalled at ground level to the east of Qutb Minar, where it remains. It is known as \"Smith's Folly\".\n"], "__answers__": ["Firoz Shah Tughlaq", "Iltutmish", "Qutab - ud - din Aibak", "Aibak 's successor and son - in - law Iltutmish", "Qutub - ud - din Aibak", "Qutab Ud - Din - Aibak"]}}
