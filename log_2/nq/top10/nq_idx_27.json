The Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas operates under the Four Seasons brand, which is managed by Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, a company with a complex ownership arrangement involving significant stakeholders.\n\n1. **Ownership Structure**: The hotel is part of a larger complex that includes the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. This indicates that the ownership of the Four Seasons Hotel is likely intertwined with the ownership of the Mandalay Bay property. Typically, luxury hotels are owned by real estate investment trusts (REITs) or private investment groups, while management companies like Four Seasons oversee operations.\n\n2. **Stakeholders**: As discussed by the experts, Cascade Investment, owned by Bill Gates, is a major stakeholder in Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, alongside Kingdom Holding Company and Triples Holdings. However, it is crucial to differentiate between the ownership of the brand and the ownership of the physical property. The Las Vegas hotel may not be directly owned by these entities but rather managed under a broader agreement.\n\n3. **Legal and Financial Considerations**: The legal framework surrounding the ownership can involve multiple layers, including management agreements and corporate structures that affect operational control. The sale of the property by Maritz, Wolff & Co. to Cascade Investment in 2013 suggests a shift in ownership that could influence current management practices.\n\n4. **Market Perception**: The involvement of high-profile investors like Bill Gates can enhance the brand's prestige, impacting customer expectations and experiences. This aspect is vital as it shapes how the hotel is perceived in the competitive luxury market.\n\n5. **Conclusion on Ownership**: Given the complexity of the ownership structure and the management agreements in place, it is reasonable to conclude that while the Four Seasons Hotel in Las Vegas is managed by Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, the actual ownership is likely tied to the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino's ownership group, which is part of MGM Resorts International.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe Four Seasons Hotel in Las Vegas is owned by MGM Resorts International, with management provided by Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts.
