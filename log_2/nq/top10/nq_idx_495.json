Understanding that the hymn is based on biblical themes allows us to infer its purpose in worship settings.\n   - Runyan's composition of the music in 1923 suggests a specific historical and cultural context in which the hymn was created, likely during a time of revival and increased interest in hymn-singing in American churches.\n\n3. **Recognition and Legacy**:\n   - Runyan's receipt of an honorary Doctor of Letters from Wheaton College and his retirement in 1948 highlight the recognition of his contributions to Christian music. This acknowledgment can inform our understanding of how creative works are valued and preserved in religious traditions.\n\n4. **Collaborative Dynamics**:\n   - The partnership between Chisholm and Runyan illustrates the collaborative nature of hymn creation, where the synergy between lyrics and music can lead to a powerful worship experience. This dynamic can be analyzed to understand how different roles contribute to the overall impact of a hymn.\n\n5. **Temporal Sequencing**:\n   - The sequence of Chisholm writing the poem followed by Runyan composing the music provides a clear causal relationship in the creative process. This understanding can help the model infer that the development of artistic works often involves multiple stages and contributions.\n\nBy synthesizing this information, we enhance the model's ability to make logical inferences about authorship, the creative process, and the significance of cultural works, thereby improving its overall causal reasoning capabilities.\n\n### Answer:\nThe hymn \"Great Is Thy Faithfulness\" was authored by **Thomas Chisholm** (who wrote the lyrics) and **William M.
