On November 23, 1996, the flight was hijacked by three Ethiopian nationals who were seeking political asylum in Australia. This detail is crucial as it provides insight into the motivations of the hijackers, indicating that their actions were driven by a desperate need for safety rather than mere criminal intent.\n\nThe hijackers demanded to be flown to Australia, but due to various circumstances, including the aircraft's fuel levels, the flight was diverted. After several hours in the air, the plane ran out of fuel and the pilot was forced to attempt a crash landing in the Indian Ocean near Grande Comore, an island in the Comoros archipelago. This geographical detail is significant as it situates the incident within a specific location, which can impact rescue operations and the overall outcome of the event.\n\nThe crash resulted in a tragic loss of life, with 125 of the 175 passengers and crew members perishing in the incident. However, it is noteworthy that 50 individuals survived with minor injuries, which adds a layer of complexity to the narrative of the crash. This survival aspect is relatively rare in hijacking scenarios and highlights the unpredictable nature of such incidents.\n\nFurthermore, the event is historically significant as it marked one of the few instances where survivors emerged from a passenger jet that had been intentionally ditched into water. This context allows for a broader understanding of aviation safety and the potential for survival in dire situations.\n\nOverall, the incident underscores critical issues related to aviation security, the psychological factors influencing hijackers, and the tragic consequences of such acts on innocent lives.\n\n### Answer:\nEthiopian Airlines Flight 961 crashed into the sea on November 23, 1996, after being hijacked by three Ethiopians seeking asylum in Australia.
