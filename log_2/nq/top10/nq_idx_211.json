Wet removal of both gases and aerosols are both of importance for wet deposition.\\n\", 'In high rainfall areas, soils tend to acidity as the basic cations are forced off the soil colloids by the mass action of hydrogen ions from the rain against those attached to the colloids. High rainfall rates can then wash the nutrients out, leaving the soil inhabited only by those organisms which are particularly efficient to uptake nutrients in very acid conditions, like in tropical rainforests. Once the colloids are saturated with H, the addition of any more hydrogen ions or aluminum hydroxyl cations drives the pH even lower (more acidic) as the soil has been left with no buffering capacity.

In low rainfall areas, unleached calcium pushes pH to 8.5 and with the addition of exchangeable sodium, soils may reach pH\\xa010. Beyond a pH of 9, plant growth is reduced. High pH results in low micro-nutrient mobility, but water-soluble chelates of those nutrients can correct the deficit. Sodium can be reduced by the addition of gypsum (calcium sulphate) as calcium adheres to clay more tightly than does sodium causing sodium to be pushed into the soil water solution where it can be washed out by an abundance of water.\\n', 'A weakly basic solvent has less tendency than a strongly basic one to accept a proton. Similarly a weak acid has less tendency to donate protons than a strong acid. As a result, a strong acid such as perchloric acid exhibits more strongly acidic properties than a weak acid such as acetic acid when dissolved in a weakly basic solvent. On the other hand, all acids tend to become indistinguishable in strength when dissolved in strongly basic solvents owing to the greater affinity of strong bases for protons. This is called the leveling effect. Strong bases are leveling solvents for acids, weak bases are differentiating solvents for acids.\\n', 'The source of almost all fresh water is precipitation from the atmosphere, in the form of mist, rain and snow. Fresh water falling as mist, rain or snow contains materials dissolved from the atmosphere and material from the sea and land over which the rain bearing clouds have traveled. In industrialized areas rain is typically acidic because of dissolved oxides of sulfur and nitrogen formed from burning of fossil fuels in cars, factories, trains and aircraft and from the atmospheric emissions of industry. In some cases this acid rain results in pollution of lakes and rivers.\\n', 'Acid rain is a rain or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low pH). It can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals and infrastructure. Acid rain is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids. Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results. Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by lightning strikes, and sulfur dioxide is produced by volcanic eruptions. Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms, causing paint to peel, corrosion of steel structures such as bridges, and weathering of stone buildings and statues as well as having impacts on human health.\\n', 'The combustion process of petroleum , coal , and wood is responsible for increased occurrence of acid rain. Combustion causes an increased amount of nitrous oxide s, along with sulfur dioxide from the sulfur in the oil. These by-products combine with water in the atmosphere to create acid rain. The increased concentrations of nitrates and other acidic substances have significant effects on the pH levels of rainfall. Data samples analyzed from the United States and Europe from the past 100 years and showed an increase in nitrous oxide emissions from combustion. The emissions were large enough to acidify the rainfall. The acid rain has adverse impacts on the larger ecosystem. For example acid rain can kill trees , acidified lakes and kill fish. Coral reefs are also destroyed from the acidified rainfall of acid rain. Acid rain also leads to the corrosion of machinery and structures (large amounts of capital) and to the slow destruction of archeological structures like the marble ruins of Rome and Greece.\\n', 'Cones can also be found on snow patches. Many snow patches contain a certain amount of debris on them, blown in on the wind. Typically, this is a course grained sand or organic material. The sand is quite porous which makes it a poor conductor of heat. During extreme wind events, this sand or organic matter is carried onto the snow patch. The snow lying underneath the porous sand is protected from the heat and does not erode away. The snow not protected by a layer of sand or organic matter begins to erode through ablation. The protected areas accumulate more sand and eventually take on a conical shape. The core of snow is protected from ablation while the surrounding snow patch continues to melt. This is another way dirt cones can form.\\n', 'Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are naturally released from volcanoes, organic compounds in the soil, wetlands, and marine systems, but the majority of these compounds come from the combustion of coal, oil, gasoline, and the smelting of ores containing sulfur. These substances dissolve in atmospheric moisture and enter lentic systems as acid rain. Lakes and ponds that contain bedrock that is rich in carbonates have a natural buffer, resulting in no alteration of pH. Systems without this bedrock, however, are very sensitive to acid inputs because they have a low neutralizing capacity, resulting in pH declines even with only small inputs of acid. At a pH of 5\u20136 algal species diversity and biomass decrease considerably, leading to an increase in water transparency \u2013 a characteristic feature of acidified lakes. As the pH continues lower, all fauna becomes less diverse. The most significant feature is the disruption of fish reproduction. Thus, the population is eventually composed of few, old individuals that eventually die and leave the systems without fishes. Acid rain has been especially harmful to lakes in Scandinavia, western Scotland, west Wales and the north eastern United States.\\n', 'Certain parent materials also contribute to soil acidification. Granites and their allied igneous rocks are called \"acidic\" because they have a lot of free quartz, which produces silicic acid on weathering. Also, they have relatively low amounts of calcium and magnesium. Some sedimentary rocks such as shale and coal are rich in sulfides, which, when hydrated and oxidized, produce sulfuric acid which is much stronger than silicic acid. Many coal soils are too acidic to support vigorous plant growth, and coal gives off strong precursors to acid rain when it is burned. Marine clays are also sulfide-rich in many cases, and such clays become very acidic if they are drained to an oxidizing state.\\n']\n\nTask Description:\nPlease extract content that may be unfamiliar to the model from these passages, \nwhich can provide the model with relevant background and unknown knowledge and concepts, \nhelping it better understand the question. and analyze the role of these contents.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To address the question regarding \"rain, sleet, or snow that contains a high concentration of acids,\" we can extract relevant content from the provided passages that elucidates the concept of acid precipitation, commonly referred to as \"acid rain.\" Here\u2019s a breakdown of the relevant content and its role in understanding the question:\n\n### Extracted Content:\n\n1. **Definition of Acid Rain**:\n   - \"Acid rain is a rain or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low pH).\"\n   - This definition is crucial as it directly answers the question by identifying acid rain as the term for precipitation with high acid concentrations.\n\n2. **Causes of Acid Rain**:\n   - \"Acid rain is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids.\"\n   - Understanding the sources of acid rain (industrial emissions, volcanic eruptions, etc.) provides context for why certain weather phenomena can be acidic.\n\n3. **Effects of Acid Rain**:\n   - \"Acid rain can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals and infrastructure.\"\n   - This information highlights the significance of acid rain beyond its definition, illustrating its ecological and structural impacts.\n\n4. **Wet Deposition**:\n   - \"Wet deposition of acids occurs when any form of precipitation (rain, snow, and so on) removes acids from the atmosphere and delivers it to the Earth's surface.\"\n   - This concept explains the mechanism by which acids are incorporated into precipitation, reinforcing the idea that not only rain but also snow and sleet can be acidic.\n\n5. **Historical Context**:\n   - \"Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results.\"\n   - This historical perspective indicates that acid rain has been a recognized environmental issue, prompting regulatory responses.\n\n6. **Geochemical Processes**:\n   - \"Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are naturally released from volcanoes... but the majority of these compounds come from the combustion of coal, oil, gasoline, and the smelting of ores containing sulfur.\"\n   - This information provides a broader understanding of the natural and anthropogenic sources of the acids involved in acid rain.\n\n### Role of Extracted Content:\n\n- **Clarification of Terminology**: The extracted definitions and explanations clarify what is meant by \"acid rain\" and its relation to other forms of precipitation like sleet and snow.\n  \n- **Contextual Understanding**: By explaining the causes and effects of acid rain, the passages provide a comprehensive background that helps in understanding the implications of acidic precipitation on the environment.\n\n- **Mechanistic Insight**: The discussion of wet deposition elucidates the processes by which acids are transferred from the atmosphere to the Earth's surface, which is essential for grasping how rain, sleet, or snow can become acidic.\n\n- **Historical and Regulatory Context**: The mention of governmental efforts to combat acid rain highlights the significance of the issue and the ongoing relevance of understanding its causes and effects.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe extracted content from the passages enriches the model's understanding of the term \"acid rain\" and its implications.

This type of precipitation is commonly known as \"acid rain.\" Acid rain is characterized by its unusually low pH due to elevated levels of hydrogen ions, which indicates a high concentration of acids.\n\n**Key Points to Consider:**\n\n1. **Definition of Acid Rain**: Acid rain refers to any form of precipitation that has a pH lower than normal rainwater (which is typically around 5.6). It is caused by the presence of sulfuric and nitric acids formed from sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) released into the atmosphere.\n\n2. **Formation Mechanism**: The process begins when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are emitted from various sources, including industrial activities, vehicle emissions, and natural events like volcanic eruptions. These gases react with water vapor and other chemicals in the atmosphere, resulting in the formation of acids that can be deposited as precipitation.\n\n3. **Environmental Impact**: Acid rain can have detrimental effects on the environment, including harm to aquatic ecosystems, vegetation, and infrastructure. It can lead to the acidification of lakes and streams, negatively impacting fish and other aquatic life, and can cause damage to buildings and monuments.\n\n4. **Wet Deposition**: This term refers to the process by which acids are removed from the atmosphere and deposited on the Earth's surface through precipitation. This includes not only rain but also snow and sleet, reinforcing the idea that all forms of precipitation can be acidic.\n\n5. **Historical Context and Regulation**: Since the 1970s, there have been concerted efforts by governments to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides due to the recognized environmental impacts of acid rain. This historical context underscores the importance of understanding acid rain as a significant environmental issue.\n\nBy synthesizing this information, we can conclude that the term for precipitation with a high concentration of acids is \"acid rain.\" This term encompasses all forms of acidic precipitation, including rain, sleet, and snow, and highlights the environmental concerns associated with it.\n\n### Answer:\nAcid rain"}], "associate": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are part of a panel of experts engaged in a collaborative discussion to address the following question:\nrain sleet or snow that contains a high concentration of acids is called\n\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['BULLET::::- High concentrations of volcanic acids, e.g., sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid, increase the conductivity of the surface snow over which they are deposited.

This duality emphasizes the complexity of the sources of acid rain and the importance of understanding both anthropogenic and natural contributions.\n\n3. **Ecological Consequences (Expert C):** The ecological impacts of acid rain are profound, affecting aquatic ecosystems and forest health. The discussion points to specific issues like the decline of fish populations and algal diversity, which are critical for maintaining ecosystem balance.\n\n4. **Atmospheric Dynamics (Expert D):** The mechanisms of wet deposition are crucial for understanding how acids are removed from the atmosphere. Weather patterns and pollutant transport influence the occurrence and intensity of acid rain, which is essential for predicting its impacts.\n\n5. **Soil Health (Expert E):** Acid rain also affects soil chemistry, leading to soil acidification that can harm plant growth and nutrient availability. Soils with low buffering capacity are particularly vulnerable, which has implications for agriculture and ecosystem resilience.\n\nThe synthesis of these insights reveals a comprehensive understanding of acid rain, emphasizing its definition, causes, ecological impacts, atmospheric dynamics, and effects on soil health. The consensus among experts underscores the need for an interdisciplinary approach to address the challenges posed by acid rain, integrating knowledge from environmental science, geochemistry, ecology, atmospheric science, and soil science.\n\n**Conclusion:** \nThe term that describes rain, sleet, or snow containing a high concentration of acids is \"acid rain.\" This term encapsulates the complex interplay of human and natural processes that lead to acidic precipitation, as well as the significant ecological and environmental consequences that arise from it. Continued research and policy efforts are essential to mitigate the impacts of acid rain on ecosystems and human health.\n\n**Answer:** acid rain"}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nrain sleet or snow that contains a high concentration of acids is called\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['BULLET::::- High concentrations of volcanic acids, e.g., sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid, increase the conductivity of the surface snow over which they are deposited. Acidity increases the conductivity, which produces a reflection. Reflections due to volcanic layers are possible at any depth.\\n', \"Wet deposition of acids occurs when any form of precipitation (rain, snow, and so on.) removes acids from the atmosphere and delivers it to the Earth's surface. This can result from the deposition of acids produced in the raindrops (see aqueous phase chemistry above) or by the precipitation removing the acids either in clouds or below clouds. Wet removal of both gases and aerosols are both of importance for wet deposition.\\n\", 'In high rainfall areas, soils tend to acidity as the basic cations are forced off the soil colloids by the mass action of hydrogen ions from the rain against those attached to the colloids. High rainfall rates can then wash the nutrients out, leaving the soil inhabited only by those organisms which are particularly efficient to uptake nutrients in very acid conditions, like in tropical rainforests. Once the colloids are saturated with H, the addition of any more hydrogen ions or aluminum hydroxyl cations drives the pH even lower (more acidic) as the soil has been left with no buffering capacity. In areas of extreme rainfall and high temperatures, the clay and humus may be washed out, further reducing the buffering capacity of the soil. In low rainfall areas, unleached calcium pushes pH to 8.5 and with the addition of exchangeable sodium, soils may reach pH\\xa010. Beyond a pH of 9, plant growth is reduced. High pH results in low micro-nutrient mobility, but water-soluble chelates of those nutrients can correct the deficit. Sodium can be reduced by the addition of gypsum (calcium sulphate) as calcium adheres to clay more tightly than does sodium causing sodium to be pushed into the soil water solution where it can be washed out by an abundance of water.\\n', 'A weakly basic solvent has less tendency than a strongly basic one to accept a proton. Similarly a weak acid has less tendency to donate protons than a strong acid. As a result, a strong acid such as perchloric acid exhibits more strongly acidic properties than a weak acid such as acetic acid when dissolved in a weakly basic solvent. On the other hand, all acids tend to become indistinguishable in strength when dissolved in strongly basic solvents owing to the greater affinity of strong bases for protons. This is called the leveling effect. Strong bases are leveling solvents for acids, weak bases are differentiating solvents for acids.\\n', 'The source of almost all fresh water is precipitation from the atmosphere, in the form of mist, rain and snow. Fresh water falling as mist, rain or snow contains materials dissolved from the atmosphere and material from the sea and land over which the rain bearing clouds have traveled. In industrialized areas rain is typically acidic because of dissolved oxides of sulfur and nitrogen formed from burning of fossil fuels in cars, factories, trains and aircraft and from the atmospheric emissions of industry. In some cases this acid rain results in pollution of lakes and rivers.\\n', 'Acid rain is a rain or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low pH). It can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals and infrastructure. Acid rain is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids. Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results. Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by lightning strikes, and sulfur dioxide is produced by volcanic eruptions. Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms, causing paint to peel, corrosion of steel structures such as bridges, and weathering of stone buildings and statues as well as having impacts on human health.\\n', 'The combustion process of petroleum , coal , and wood is responsible for increased occurrence of acid rain. Combustion causes an increased amount of nitrous oxide s, along with sulfur dioxide from the sulfur in the oil. These by-products combine with water in the atmosphere to create acid rain. The increased concentrations of nitrates and other acidic substances have significant effects on the pH levels of rainfall. Data samples analyzed from the United States and Europe from the past 100 years and showed an increase in nitrous oxide emissions from combustion. The emissions were large enough to acidify the rainfall. The acid rain has adverse impacts on the larger ecosystem. For example acid rain can kill trees , acidified lakes and kill fish. Coral reefs are also destroyed from the acidified rainfall of acid rain. Acid rain also leads to the corrosion of machinery and structures (large amounts of capital) and to the slow destruction of archeological structures like the marble ruins of Rome and Greece.\\n', 'Cones can also be found on snow patches. Many snow patches contain a certain amount of debris on them, blown in on the wind. Typically, this is a course grained sand or organic material. The sand is quite porous which makes it a poor conductor of heat. During extreme wind events, this sand or organic matter is carried onto the snow patch. The snow lying underneath the porous sand is protected from the heat and does not erode away. The snow not protected by a layer of sand or organic matter begins to erode through ablation. The protected areas accumulate more sand and eventually take on a conical shape. The core of snow is protected from ablation while the surrounding snow patch continues to melt. This is another way dirt cones can form.\\n', 'Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are naturally released from volcanoes, organic compounds in the soil, wetlands, and marine systems, but the majority of these compounds come from the combustion of coal, oil, gasoline, and the smelting of ores containing sulfur. These substances dissolve in atmospheric moisture and enter lentic systems as acid rain. Lakes and ponds that contain bedrock that is rich in carbonates have a natural buffer, resulting in no alteration of pH. Systems without this bedrock, however, are very sensitive to acid inputs because they have a low neutralizing capacity, resulting in pH declines even with only small inputs of acid. At a pH of 5\u20136 algal species diversity and biomass decrease considerably, leading to an increase in water transparency \u2013 a characteristic feature of acidified lakes. As the pH continues lower, all fauna becomes less diverse. The most significant feature is the disruption of fish reproduction. Thus, the population is eventually composed of few, old individuals that eventually die and leave the systems without fishes. Acid rain has been especially harmful to lakes in Scandinavia, western Scotland, west Wales and the north eastern United States.\\n', 'Certain parent materials also contribute to soil acidification. Granites and their allied igneous rocks are called \"acidic\" because they have a lot of free quartz, which produces silicic acid on weathering. Also, they have relatively low amounts of calcium and magnesium. Some sedimentary rocks such as shale and coal are rich in sulfides, which, when hydrated and oxidized, produce sulfuric acid which is much stronger than silicic acid. Many coal soils are too acidic to support vigorous plant growth, and coal gives off strong precursors to acid rain when it is burned. Marine clays are also sulfide-rich in many cases, and such clays become very acidic if they are drained to an oxidizing state.\\n']\n\nTask Description:\nPlease extract content from these passages that can help enhance the model's causal reasoning and logical inference abilities.\nconsolidate these contents, and analyze how the selected information may impact the improvement of the model's causal reasoning and logical inference capabilities.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To answer the question regarding the term for \"rain, sleet, or snow that contains a high concentration of acids,\" we can extract relevant information from the provided passages.

Acidity increases the conductivity, which produces a reflection. Reflections due to volcanic layers are possible at any depth.\n", "Wet deposition of acids occurs when any form of precipitation (rain, snow, and so on.) removes acids from the atmosphere and delivers it to the Earth's surface. This can result from the deposition of acids produced in the raindrops (see aqueous phase chemistry above) or by the precipitation removing the acids either in clouds or below clouds. Wet removal of both gases and aerosols are both of importance for wet deposition.\n", "In high rainfall areas, soils tend to acidity as the basic cations are forced off the soil colloids by the mass action of hydrogen ions from the rain against those attached to the colloids. High rainfall rates can then wash the nutrients out, leaving the soil inhabited only by those organisms which are particularly efficient to uptake nutrients in very acid conditions, like in tropical rainforests. Once the colloids are saturated with H, the addition of any more hydrogen ions or aluminum hydroxyl cations drives the pH even lower (more acidic) as the soil has been left with no buffering capacity. In areas of extreme rainfall and high temperatures, the clay and humus may be washed out, further reducing the buffering capacity of the soil. In low rainfall areas, unleached calcium pushes pH to 8.5 and with the addition of exchangeable sodium, soils may reach pH\u00a010. Beyond a pH of 9, plant growth is reduced. High pH results in low micro-nutrient mobility, but water-soluble chelates of those nutrients can correct the deficit. Sodium can be reduced by the addition of gypsum (calcium sulphate) as calcium adheres to clay more tightly than does sodium causing sodium to be pushed into the soil water solution where it can be washed out by an abundance of water.\n", "A weakly basic solvent has less tendency than a strongly basic one to accept a proton. Similarly a weak acid has less tendency to donate protons than a strong acid. As a result, a strong acid such as perchloric acid exhibits more strongly acidic properties than a weak acid such as acetic acid when dissolved in a weakly basic solvent. On the other hand, all acids tend to become indistinguishable in strength when dissolved in strongly basic solvents owing to the greater affinity of strong bases for protons. This is called the leveling effect. Strong bases are leveling solvents for acids, weak bases are differentiating solvents for acids.\n", "The source of almost all fresh water is precipitation from the atmosphere, in the form of mist, rain and snow. Fresh water falling as mist, rain or snow contains materials dissolved from the atmosphere and material from the sea and land over which the rain bearing clouds have traveled. In industrialized areas rain is typically acidic because of dissolved oxides of sulfur and nitrogen formed from burning of fossil fuels in cars, factories, trains and aircraft and from the atmospheric emissions of industry. In some cases this acid rain results in pollution of lakes and rivers.\n", "Acid rain is a rain or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low pH). It can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals and infrastructure. Acid rain is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids. Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results. Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by lightning strikes, and sulfur dioxide is produced by volcanic eruptions. Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms, causing paint to peel, corrosion of steel structures such as bridges, and weathering of stone buildings and statues as well as having impacts on human health.\n", "The combustion process of petroleum , coal , and wood is responsible for increased occurrence of acid rain. Combustion causes an increased amount of nitrous oxide s, along with sulfur dioxide from the sulfur in the oil. These by-products combine with water in the atmosphere to create acid rain. The increased concentrations of nitrates and other acidic substances have significant effects on the pH levels of rainfall. Data samples analyzed from the United States and Europe from the past 100 years and showed an increase in nitrous oxide emissions from combustion. The emissions were large enough to acidify the rainfall. The acid rain has adverse impacts on the larger ecosystem. For example acid rain can kill trees , acidified lakes and kill fish. Coral reefs are also destroyed from the acidified rainfall of acid rain. Acid rain also leads to the corrosion of machinery and structures (large amounts of capital) and to the slow destruction of archeological structures like the marble ruins of Rome and Greece.\n", "Cones can also be found on snow patches. Many snow patches contain a certain amount of debris on them, blown in on the wind. Typically, this is a course grained sand or organic material. The sand is quite porous which makes it a poor conductor of heat. During extreme wind events, this sand or organic matter is carried onto the snow patch. The snow lying underneath the porous sand is protected from the heat and does not erode away. The snow not protected by a layer of sand or organic matter begins to erode through ablation. The protected areas accumulate more sand and eventually take on a conical shape. The core of snow is protected from ablation while the surrounding snow patch continues to melt. This is another way dirt cones can form.\n", "Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are naturally released from volcanoes, organic compounds in the soil, wetlands, and marine systems, but the majority of these compounds come from the combustion of coal, oil, gasoline, and the smelting of ores containing sulfur. These substances dissolve in atmospheric moisture and enter lentic systems as acid rain. Lakes and ponds that contain bedrock that is rich in carbonates have a natural buffer, resulting in no alteration of pH. Systems without this bedrock, however, are very sensitive to acid inputs because they have a low neutralizing capacity, resulting in pH declines even with only small inputs of acid. At a pH of 5\u20136 algal species diversity and biomass decrease considerably, leading to an increase in water transparency \u2013 a characteristic feature of acidified lakes. As the pH continues lower, all fauna becomes less diverse. The most significant feature is the disruption of fish reproduction. Thus, the population is eventually composed of few, old individuals that eventually die and leave the systems without fishes. Acid rain has been especially harmful to lakes in Scandinavia, western Scotland, west Wales and the north eastern United States.\n", "Certain parent materials also contribute to soil acidification. Granites and their allied igneous rocks are called \"acidic\" because they have a lot of free quartz, which produces silicic acid on weathering. Also, they have relatively low amounts of calcium and magnesium. Some sedimentary rocks such as shale and coal are rich in sulfides, which, when hydrated and oxidized, produce sulfuric acid which is much stronger than silicic acid. Many coal soils are too acidic to support vigorous plant growth, and coal gives off strong precursors to acid rain when it is burned. Marine clays are also sulfide-rich in many cases, and such clays become very acidic if they are drained to an oxidizing state.\n"], "__answers__": ["Acid rain", "`` Acid rain ''"]}}
