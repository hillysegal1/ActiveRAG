This legislation was specifically designed to address the plight of suffragettes who engaged in hunger strikes while imprisoned, which often led to severe health complications. The government aimed to prevent the potential deaths of these prisoners, as such events would likely provoke public outrage and sympathy for the suffragette cause.\n\nThe Act allowed for the temporary release of prisoners who were deemed too ill to continue serving their sentences due to the effects of hunger strikes. Importantly, it also included provisions for their re-arrest once they had recovered, thereby allowing the government to manage the situation without appearing to capitulate to the demands of the suffragettes.\n\nAdditionally, the Act was a strategic response to the government's desire to avoid creating martyrs out of the suffragettes, which could further galvanize public support for their cause. Notably, the first individuals released under this Act were Hugh Franklin and his soon-to-be wife, Elsie Duval, highlighting the personal stories intertwined with this historical legislation.\n\nIn summary, the Cat and Mouse Act was not only a legislative measure but also a significant event in the broader narrative of the suffragette movement, reflecting the tensions between the government and activists during this period.\n\n### Answer:\nThe Cat and Mouse Act was introduced in April 1913 as part of the government's response to the hunger strikes of suffragettes in the UK."}], "question_info": {"question": "when was the cat and mouse act introduced", "passages": ["BULLET::::- April 1913: Cat and Mouse Act passed, allowing hunger-striking prisoners to be released when their health was threatened and then re-arrested when they had recovered.\n", "BULLET::::- 1913 Cat and Mouse Act\n", "BULLET::::- Cat and Mouse Act, a 1913 British law\n", "BULLET::::- United Kingdom: The Cat and Mouse Act was introduced for suffragettes who refused to eat.\n", "BULLET::::- April 1913: Cat and Mouse Act passed, allowing hunger-striking prisoners to be released when their health was threatened and then re-arrested when they had recovered.
