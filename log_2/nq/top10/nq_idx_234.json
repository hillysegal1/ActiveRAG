It was during this period that drilling and practice programs were first developed for exclusive classroom use. Schools became divided over which computer manufacturers they were willing to support, with grade schools generally using Apple computers and high schools preferring DOS based machines. Hardware shortages in schools became a major issue, leaving many teachers unable to provide enough computers for students to use. Despite this, by 1989 computer usage shifted from being a relative rarity in American public schools, to being present in nearly every school district.\\n', 'The introduction of the modern library and the pencil in the mid-1600s marked the beginning of the use of technology in education? In the latter part of the 1970s, the very first computer was integrated into schools. By the early 1980s when IBM created the first PC, nearly twenty percent of schools in the UK and the US had computers in use. By the year 2005, more than 50% of public schools included laptops for students in their technology budget. It was at this same time, more than 90% of schools had access to the Internet.

Between 1997 and 1999, the ratio of students to multimedia computers decreased from 21 students per machine to less than 10 students per machine. Colleges began creating specialized classrooms designed to provide students with access to the utilization of the most modern technology available. Classrooms such as the \"Classroom 2000\" built at Georgia Tech in 1999 which featured computers with audio and video equipment designed to capture detailed recordings of lectures as a replacement for traditional note taking began to become more common. By 2000, the student to computer ratio at some schools in the US decreased to only 5 students per school computer.\\n', 'In 1975, Apple Inc. began donating Apple 1 model computers to schools, and mainframes began to lose their former dominance over academic research.

The introduction of personal computers, particularly the Apple II and IBM PC, marked a significant turning point. By the early 1980s, nearly 20% of schools in the UK and the US had computers in use, and by 1989, computer usage had become nearly ubiquitous in American public schools. This indicates a rapid transition from rarity to commonality in educational settings.\n\n**Expert 2: Technological Advancements**  \nI agree with Expert 1 but would like to emphasize the role of technological advancements in this transition. The development of user-friendly operating systems and educational software was crucial. For instance, the emergence of companies like Br\u00f8derbund and MECC in the early 1980s created a market for educational software tailored for personal computers. This not only facilitated the use of computers in classrooms but also made them more appealing to educators and students alike.\n\n**Expert 3: Societal Impact**  \nWhile the technological advancements are important, we must also consider the societal context. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw a cultural shift towards valuing computer literacy. The predictions about home automation and the role of computers in family life, as noted in the passages, reflect a growing belief in the necessity of computers for everyday tasks. This societal acceptance likely influenced schools to adopt computers more readily, as they recognized the importance of preparing students for a future where technology would be integral to daily life.\n\n**Expert 4: Global Perspective**  \nI would like to add a global perspective to our discussion. The passage about the introduction of computers in Soviet schools highlights that the push for computer literacy was not limited to the West. In 1985, the Elektronika BK-0010 became a common personal computer in Soviet schools, indicating that the movement towards integrating computers in education was a global phenomenon. This suggests that the timeline for widespread computer use in schools may vary by region but shares a common thread of recognizing the importance of technology in education.\n\n**Expert 5: Home Usage Trends**  \nRegarding home usage, the late 1970s and early 1980s also marked the beginning of computers becoming more common in households. The predictions about how families would utilize computers for various tasks illustrate a growing belief in their utility. However, it\u2019s important to note that home computers were initially seen as luxury items, and widespread adoption took time. By the mid-1980s, as prices dropped and more affordable models became available, home computers began to proliferate, paralleling their adoption in schools.\n\n**Synthesis of Insights**  \nThe discussion reveals a multifaceted understanding of when computers became widespread in homes and schools. The historical timeline indicates that the late 1970s and early 1980s were pivotal, with significant advancements in technology and a cultural shift towards valuing computer literacy.

Between 1997 and 1999, the ratio of students to multimedia computers decreased from 21 students per machine to less than 10 students per machine. Colleges began creating specialized classrooms designed to provide students with access to the utilization of the most modern technology available. Classrooms such as the \"Classroom 2000\" built at Georgia Tech in 1999 which featured computers with audio and video equipment designed to capture detailed recordings of lectures as a replacement for traditional note taking began to become more common. By 2000, the student to computer ratio at some schools in the US decreased to only 5 students per school computer.\\n', 'In 1975, Apple Inc. began donating Apple 1 model computers to schools, and mainframes began to lose their former dominance over academic research. Computer usage continued to grow rapidly throughout this era. In 1977, it was estimated that over 90% of students at Dartmouth College had used computers at some point in their college careers.

Mothers would keep their recipe catalog in \"kitchen computer\" databases and turn to a medical database for help with child care, fathers would use the family\\'s computer to manage family finances and track automobile maintenance. Children would use online encyclopedias for school work and would be avid video gamers. The computer would even be tasked with babysitting younger children. Home automation would bring about the intelligent home of the 1980s. Using Videotex, NAPLPS or some sort of vaguely conceptualized computer technology, television would gain interactivity. It would be possible to do the week\\'s grocery shopping through the television. The \"personalized newspaper\" (to be displayed on the television screen) was another commonly predicted application. Morning coffee would be brewed automatically under computer control. The same household computer would control the home\\'s lighting and temperature. Robots would take the garbage out, and be programmed to perform new tasks via the home computer. Electronics were expensive, so it was generally assumed that each home would have only one computer for the entire family to use. Home control would be performed in a multitasking time-sharing arrangement, with interfaces to the various devices it was expected to control.\\n', 'A program to expand computer literacy in Soviet schools was one of the first initiatives announced by Mikhail Gorbachev after he came to power in 1985.

It was during this period that drilling and practice programs were first developed for exclusive classroom use. Schools became divided over which computer manufacturers they were willing to support, with grade schools generally using Apple computers and high schools preferring DOS based machines. Hardware shortages in schools became a major issue, leaving many teachers unable to provide enough computers for students to use. Despite this, by 1989 computer usage shifted from being a relative rarity in American public schools, to being present in nearly every school district.\n", "The introduction of the modern library and the pencil in the mid-1600s marked the beginning of the use of technology in education? In the latter part of the 1970s, the very first computer was integrated into schools. By the early 1980s when IBM created the first PC, nearly twenty percent of schools in the UK and the US had computers in use. By the year 2005, more than 50% of public schools included laptops for students in their technology budget. It was at this same time, more than 90% of schools had access to the Internet. By 2011, many schools were including tablet PCs for students and teachers in their technology budget.\n", "Correlating with the development of modern operating systems like Windows 98 and the continuing support of government funding, the prevalence of educational computer usage boomed during this era. Between 1997 and 1999, the ratio of students to multimedia computers decreased from 21 students per machine to less than 10 students per machine. Colleges began creating specialized classrooms designed to provide students with access to the utilization of the most modern technology available. Classrooms such as the \"Classroom 2000\" built at Georgia Tech in 1999 which featured computers with audio and video equipment designed to capture detailed recordings of lectures as a replacement for traditional note taking began to become more common. By 2000, the student to computer ratio at some schools in the US decreased to only 5 students per school computer.\n", "In 1975, Apple Inc. began donating Apple 1 model computers to schools, and mainframes began to lose their former dominance over academic research. Computer usage continued to grow rapidly throughout this era. In 1977, it was estimated that over 90% of students at Dartmouth College had used computers at some point in their college careers. Walter Koetke, the director of a Lexington, Massachusetts school system commented that, \"It's still possible for a student to get through here without using the computer, but he would certainly have to try to do it\".\n", "Computer education was introduced in 1996, when computers and multimedia equipment were purchased.\n", "Home computers were a luxury import in Korea in the late 1970s and software programming was the domain of institutes like \"KIST\". In 1983, domestic computers \u2013 which were clones of Japanese and American models \u2013 started being distributed as well as computer magazines. In March of the same year, companies like Samsung started to offer computers to schools to raise a computer-savvy generation. These same companies would host software competitions, but most of the programmers that won those competitions developing games preferred to use their knowledge for more serious software or jobs. In 1984, the computer models became more standardized, with almost all new models based on either MSX or Apple II standard. This made it easier to import and copy foreign games, as there was no copyright law in Korea at the time for computer programs.\n", "The arrival of the personal computer, with the Altair 8800 in 1975, changed the field of software in general, with specific implications for educational software.
