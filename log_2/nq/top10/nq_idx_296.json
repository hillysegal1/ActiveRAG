In this referendum, the British public voted on whether to remain in or leave the EU, resulting in **51.9%** in favor of leaving and **48.1%** in favor of remaining, with a notable turnout of **72.2%**. This significant public vote indicates a clear mandate for the government to act on the decision.\n\nFollowing the referendum, the UK government invoked **Article 50** of the Treaty on the European Union on **March 29, 2017**, formally initiating the process of leaving the EU. This action signaled the government's commitment to follow through with the public's decision. The initial target date for the UK's exit was set for **March 29, 2019**. However, due to ongoing negotiations and political debates, this deadline was extended multiple times, with final deadlines being **April 12, 2019**, and **October 31, 2019**.\n\nThe legal context surrounding this decision is also crucial. In December 2018, the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK could legally revoke Article 50, which opened discussions about the possibility of remaining in the EU.
