This cyclical nature allows for predictable scheduling.\n\n2. **Recent Olympic History**:\n   - The last Summer Olympics were held in Tokyo, Japan, in 2021, which was originally scheduled for 2020 but postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This context is crucial for understanding the timeline of future events.\n\n3. **Upcoming Olympic Events**:\n   - The next Summer Olympics are scheduled for 2024, and the host city has already been determined. This information is vital for establishing the immediate future of the Olympic Games.\n\n4. **Host City for 2024**:\n   - The city selected to host the 2024 Summer Olympics is Paris, France. This decision is significant as it reflects the IOC's selection process, which considers various factors such as infrastructure, historical significance, and the city's capacity to host large-scale events.\n\n5. **Future Olympic Events**:\n   - Following Paris, the 2026 Winter Olympics will be held in Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, and the 2028 Summer Olympics will take place in Los Angeles, USA. This information helps establish a broader context for the Olympic schedule.\n\n6. **Historical Context of Hosting**:\n   - Los Angeles has previously hosted the Olympics twice (1932 and 1984), which adds to its credibility and experience in organizing such events. This historical context can influence perceptions of future events in the same city.\n\n7. **Paralympic Games**:\n   - The 2028 Summer Paralympics will also be held in Los Angeles, marking the first time the city hosts the Paralympic Games. This dual hosting can impact logistical planning and public interest, which are important for understanding the implications of hosting multiple events.\n\n8. **Causal Relationships and Implications**:\n   - The selection of host cities is influenced by various factors, including historical significance, infrastructure, and previous hosting experiences. Understanding these causal relationships can enhance the model's ability to predict future trends and outcomes related to the Olympics.\n\n9. **Comparative Analysis**:\n   - By comparing different host cities and their historical contexts, the model can draw inferences about the potential success or challenges of future events based on past experiences. This comparative analysis can improve the model's reasoning capabilities.\n\n### Answer:\nThe next Olympics will be held in Paris, France, in 2024."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhere will be the next olympics be held\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n[\"This first ever question for the live audience was, 'Where will the next Olympic games be held (1980)?'.
