This system was widely adopted in the 19th century and played a significant role in international finance until the mid-20th century.\n\n2. **Initial Abandonment in 1933**: The U.S. dollar was effectively taken off the gold standard domestically on April 19, 1933, during the Great Depression. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order required citizens to exchange their gold holdings for U.S. dollars, which marked a significant shift in monetary policy aimed at combating deflation and stabilizing the economy. This action removed gold as legal tender for debts, allowing the dollar to float freely without a guaranteed price in gold.\n\n3. **Gold Reserve Act of 1934**: Following the 1933 abandonment, the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 further solidified this departure by devaluing the dollar from $20.67 to $35 per ounce of gold. This act not only changed the dollar's value but also rendered gold clauses unenforceable, indicating a profound shift in the government's approach to currency and gold.\n\n4. **Bretton Woods System and International Convertibility**: After World War II, the Bretton Woods system established a new international monetary order where the U.S. dollar was pegged to gold at $35 an ounce, allowing foreign governments and central banks to convert dollars into gold. This system maintained some level of gold backing for international transactions, but it was not a return to the gold standard in the traditional sense.\n\n5. **The Nixon Shock of 1971**: The definitive end to the gold standard came on August 15, 1971, when President Richard Nixon announced the suspension of the dollar's convertibility into gold. This event, known as the \"Nixon Shock,\" marked a radical departure from the Bretton Woods system and led to the current era of fiat currencies, where money is not backed by physical commodities.\n\n6. **Evolution of Monetary Policy**: The discussion highlights the evolution of the U.S. dollar's relationship with gold, from its initial abandonment in 1933 to the final severance in 1971. This evolution reflects broader trends in economic policy and international relations, illustrating how monetary systems adapt to changing economic realities.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe U.S. dollar left the gold standard in two significant phases: first, it was effectively abandoned domestically on April 19, 1933, during the Great Depression, when citizens were required to exchange their gold for dollars.
