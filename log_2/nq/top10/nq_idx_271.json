Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Geographical Proximity**: \n   - Bethesda, Maryland, is explicitly mentioned as being just outside Washington, D.C. This indicates a close geographical relationship and suggests that areas like Bethesda are likely to be influenced by the socio-economic dynamics of the capital.\n\n2. **Inside the Beltway**: \n   - The term \"Inside the Beltway\" refers to areas in Maryland and Virginia that lie within the Capital Beltway, which encircles Washington, D.C. This implies that regions within this boundary are closely connected to the capital, both geographically and in terms of infrastructure and commuting patterns.\n\n3. **Transportation Infrastructure**: \n   - The mention of Maryland Route 6, Maryland Route 210, and U.S. Route 301 highlights the transportation links between Maryland and Washington, D.C.
