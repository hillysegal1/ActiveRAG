This organization is a regional intergovernmental entity aimed at promoting economic and political cooperation among its member states in South Asia.\n\n1. **Establishment Date**: The specific date of SAARC's formation is crucial. From the retrieved knowledge, I know that SAARC was officially established on **December 8, 1985**. This date is significant as it marks the beginning of formal cooperation among the member states.\n\n2. **Founding Members**: The founding members of SAARC included **India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Maldives, and Bhutan**. This information is important because it highlights the initial collaborative efforts among these nations, which were motivated by shared regional interests.\n\n3. **Expansion**: The organization expanded in **April 2007** when Afghanistan joined as the eighth member. This indicates the evolving nature of regional cooperation and the inclusion of more countries over time, which can impact the dynamics of cooperation.\n\n4. **Purpose and Functionality**: SAARC's primary goal is to foster regional integration and cooperation. Understanding this purpose allows for reasoning about the implications of its formation, such as the potential for economic development, conflict resolution, and enhanced diplomatic relations among member states.\n\n5. **Geographical Context**: SAARC encompasses countries in **Southern Asia**, collectively representing a significant population of approximately **1.5 billion people**. This demographic factor is essential for understanding the potential influence and reach of SAARC's initiatives.\n\n6. **Temporal Relationships**: Recognizing the establishment date allows for the inference of timelines and the evolution of regional cooperation. For instance, the formation of SAARC in 1985 set the stage for future collaborations and expansions, such as Afghanistan's membership in 2007.\n\n7. **Membership Dynamics**: The founding and subsequent expansion of SAARC can be analyzed to understand the political and economic implications of these changes. The inclusion of Afghanistan may reflect shifts in regional priorities and cooperation strategies.\n\nBy synthesizing this information, I can enhance my reasoning about the causal relationships and logical implications surrounding SAARC's formation and its role in regional cooperation.\n\n### Answer:\nSAARC was formed on **December 8, 1985**."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhen was the south asian association for regional co-operation (saarc) formed\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n[\"The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is an economic and political organization of eight countries in Southern Asia.
