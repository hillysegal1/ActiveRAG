To understand its form, we need to analyze the structure of the symphony, which typically consists of four movements. \n\n1. **First Movement (Molto Allegro)**: This movement is in sonata form, which includes an exposition, development, and recapitulation. The exposition presents two contrasting themes, the development explores and varies these themes, and the recapitulation returns to the original themes.\n\n2. **Second Movement (Andante)**: This movement is in a more lyrical style and is often structured in a theme and variations form. It presents a main theme followed by variations that elaborate on it.\n\n3. **Third Movement (Menuetto and Trio)**: This movement follows the traditional minuet and trio form, which consists of a minuet (A), a contrasting trio (B), and a return to the minuet (A). This structure is typical of classical symphonies.\n\n4. **Fourth Movement (Allegro assai)**: The final movement is also in sonata form, similar to the first movement, and brings the symphony to a vigorous and energetic conclusion.\n\nOverall, the symphony adheres to the classical four-movement structure, with the first and fourth movements in sonata form, the second in theme and variations, and the third in minuet and trio form.\n\nAnswer:\nThe form of Mozart's Symphony No. 40 is a four-movement structure: \n1.
