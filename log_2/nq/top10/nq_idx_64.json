In this game, the Eagles defeated the New England Patriots with a score of 41\u201333, marking their first Super Bowl victory.\n\n4. **Historical Significance**: The victory in Super Bowl LII was particularly meaningful as it ended a long championship drought for Philadelphia sports teams, with the last championship win by a Philly-based pro sports team occurring in 1983 (NBA title). This context adds emotional weight to the Eagles' achievement.\n\n5. **Causal Relationships**: The Eagles' success in 2018 can be attributed to several factors:\n   - A strong regular-season performance, finishing with a 13-3 record.\n   - Key victories in the playoffs against formidable opponents (e.g., the Falcons and Vikings).\n   - The narrative of overcoming a \"curse\" or championship drought, which likely galvanized both the team and its fanbase.\n\n6. **Logical Inference**: The model can infer that the Eagles' historical performance, including previous Super Bowl losses, may have influenced their strategies and mindset leading into Super Bowl LII. The underdog status they held entering the game also plays a role in shaping expectations and outcomes.\n\n7. **Narrative Construction**: The information allows for the construction of a narrative that combines statistical data (win-loss records) with qualitative aspects (the emotional significance of the victory), which is essential for understanding the broader implications of sports events.\n\n8. **Temporal Reasoning**: The specific date of the Super Bowl appearance (February 4, 2018) provides a clear temporal anchor, allowing the model to understand the timeline of events in the Eagles' history and their impact on the team's legacy.\n\n### Answer:\nThe last time the Eagles were at the Super Bowl was on February 4, 2018, when they played in Super Bowl LII and defeated the New England Patriots 41\u201333.
