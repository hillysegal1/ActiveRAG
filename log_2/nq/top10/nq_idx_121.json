Farmers keep bulls to mate with female cattle (cows) to produce calves. This natural breeding process is essential for maintaining and expanding the herd.\n\n3. **Oestrus Recognition and Bulling**: Farmers utilize a practice known as bulling to recognize oestrus in cows, which is the period when they are fertile and can be bred. Understanding oestrus is vital for effective breeding management, ensuring that cows are bred at the optimal time.\n\n4. **Artificial Insemination (AI)**: In modern farming, many dairy farmers prefer to use artificial insemination (AI) instead of natural breeding. AI allows farmers to breed cows without needing a bull on-site, as semen collected from bulls can be stored and used later. This practice not only improves the genetic quality of the herd but also allows for the introduction of diverse bloodlines.\n\n5. **Genetic Improvement**: Bulls are selected based on desirable traits such as size, health, and productivity. By using bulls with superior genetics, farmers can enhance the overall quality of their livestock, which is crucial for both dairy and beef production.\n\n6. **Handling and Safety Concerns**: Bulls can be aggressive and pose safety risks to farmers. Understanding how to handle bulls safely is essential to prevent accidents, as handling these powerful animals can lead to life-threatening situations.\n\n7. **Semen Collection Techniques**: The process of collecting semen from bulls is a critical aspect of both natural breeding and AI.

Working dogs are essential in the rugged gorge country and also in scrubby locations where dogs are able to flush out cattle from low brush. The flight zone, too, is an important principle to remember when working or mustering livestock. When mustering cattle in isolated gorge country a good dog will silently move ahead of the stockman and block up the stock until the rider appears to take control. In Australia, a stockwhip is usually carried and used as needed when mustering cattle with horses. In North America, a lasso is used from horseback, both to rope and move particularly recalcitrant animals, but also as a simple goad. However, a different style of whip, also called a \"stock whip,\" may be utilized by handlers on the ground.\n", "Bull calves intended for breeding commonly are bred on specialized dairy breeding farms, not production farms.
