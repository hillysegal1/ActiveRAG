This change was influenced by various groups, notably the Knights of Columbus, which had been advocating for this addition since 1951. The historical context of the early 1950s, marked by the Cold War and a heightened emphasis on American values, played a significant role in this decision.\n\n**Expert B (Legislative Process):** I agree with Expert A on the date and the influence of the Knights of Columbus. However, it's important to highlight the legislative journey that led to this change. The initial proposal came from Representative Louis C.

The collaboration between various organizations, including the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Knights of Columbus, was crucial in garnering support for the bill.\n\n**Expert C (Cultural Impact):** While the legislative process is important, we must also consider the cultural implications of adding \"under God.\" This phrase has sparked significant debate regarding the separation of church and state. Critics argue that its inclusion violates this principle, while supporters view it as a reflection of American heritage and values. The controversy surrounding this addition continues to resonate in contemporary discussions about religion in public life.\n\n**Expert D (Legal Perspectives):** Building on Expert C's point, the legal challenges that arose after the addition of \"under God\" are noteworthy. For instance, the case of \"Newdow v. Rio Linda Union School District\" in 2010 reaffirmed the phrase's presence in the Pledge, with the court ruling that it serves a ceremonial purpose rather than establishing a religion. This highlights the ongoing tension between constitutional interpretation and societal values.\n\n**Expert E (Public Sentiment):** I would like to add that public sentiment played a significant role in the acceptance of this phrase. The post-war era saw a surge in patriotic fervor, and many Americans embraced the idea of a nation \"under God\" as a unifying concept. This sentiment was reflected in the widespread adoption of the revised Pledge in schools and public ceremonies.\n\n**Synthesis of Insights:**\n\nThe discussion reveals a multifaceted understanding of when and why the words \"under God\" were added to the Pledge of Allegiance. The consensus among experts is that the official addition occurred on June 14, 1954, following a concerted effort by various organizations and legislators.

Experts highlight the ongoing debates about the separation of church and state, the cultural significance of the phrase, and the legal challenges that have arisen since its inclusion. The interplay between public sentiment and legislative action underscores the complexity of this issue, illustrating how deeply intertwined cultural values and legal frameworks can be.\n\nIn conclusion, the addition of \"under God\" to the Pledge of Allegiance is not merely a historical fact but a reflection of broader societal dynamics.
