A notable scene includes a Jewish character in a barbershop who humorously refers to Akeem as \"Kunta Kinte.\" This character is played by actor **Eriq La Salle**, who is primarily known for his role in the television series \"ER.\" The inclusion of this character adds a layer of cultural commentary and humor, reflecting the film's broader themes of identity and assimilation.\n\n**Expert 2: Cultural Critic**\nI agree with the film historian's identification of Eriq La Salle as the actor portraying the Jewish character. However, I would like to emphasize the significance of this character's dialogue.
