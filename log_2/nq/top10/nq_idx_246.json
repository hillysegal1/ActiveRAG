The Act of Union in 1801 is a pivotal moment that merged the Kingdom of Ireland with Great Britain, effectively ending Ireland's legislative independence. This act set the stage for a long and complex struggle for self-governance.\n\n2. **Early Movements**: The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw various movements advocating for Irish autonomy, culminating in the Easter Rising of 1916. This rebellion against British rule galvanized public support for independence and marked a turning point in the Irish nationalist movement.\n\n3. **Anglo-Irish Treaty (1921)**: Following the Easter Rising and subsequent conflicts, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed on December 6, 1921. This treaty ended the Anglo-Irish War and established the Irish Free State as a self-governing dominion within the British Commonwealth. It is crucial to note that the treaty also partitioned Ireland, allowing Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, which has had lasting implications for Irish politics and society.\n\n4. **Establishment of the Irish Free State**: The Irish Free State officially came into existence on December 6, 1922. This marked a significant step towards independence, as it granted Ireland a degree of self-governance, although it remained a dominion under British oversight.\n\n5. **De Facto Independence**: While the establishment of the Irish Free State was a major milestone, it is important to recognize that Ireland had been operating with a degree of de facto independence prior to this formal recognition. The political dynamics of the time allowed for a gradual shift towards greater autonomy.\n\n6. **Constitution of 1937**: The adoption of a new constitution in 1937 further solidified Ireland's status as a sovereign state. This constitution reflected the evolving identity of the Irish nation and its aspirations for full independence.\n\n7. **Republic of Ireland (1949)**: The culmination of Ireland's independence journey occurred in 1949 when the country declared itself a republic, severing all ties with the British monarchy. This declaration marked the final step in Ireland's quest for complete sovereignty.\n\n8. **Ongoing Implications**: The partition of Ireland and the establishment of Northern Ireland have had enduring effects on Irish society, politics, and identity.

This marked a significant loss of legislative independence for Ireland.\n\n2. **Nationalist Movements**: The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the rise of nationalist movements, culminating in the 1916 Easter Rising. This rebellion was a pivotal moment that shifted public sentiment towards the cause of independence, leading to increased support for nationalist leaders and parties.\n\n3. **Anglo-Irish Treaty**: The signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December 1921 was a critical turning point. It established the Irish Free State as a self-governing dominion within the British Commonwealth, officially recognized on December 6, 1922. However, this status was not full independence, as the Free State retained certain ties to Britain.\n\n4. **Legal and Constitutional Developments**: The legal implications of the Anglo-Irish Treaty were significant. The establishment of a Provisional Government allowed for some self-governance, but it wasn't until the adoption of a new constitution in 1937 that Ireland declared itself a sovereign state, further distancing itself from British influence.\n\n5. **Full Independence**: The complete severance from British ties came in 1949 when Ireland declared itself a republic, officially leaving the Commonwealth. This gradual process illustrates the complexities of national identity and the evolution of sovereignty in Ireland.\n\n6. **Social Factors**: The struggle for independence was also deeply intertwined with social issues, including the impact of the Great Famine and the penal laws that marginalized the Catholic population. These social dynamics fueled the desire for self-governance and were integral to the independence movement.\n\n**Answer:**\nIreland gained its independence from England on December 6, 1922, with the establishment of the Irish Free State as a self-governing dominion within the British Commonwealth. However, it is important to note that this was not full independence; it wasn't until 1949 that Ireland declared itself a republic and fully severed ties with the British Commonwealth. The journey to independence involved a complex interplay of historical, political, legal, and social factors, reflecting a gradual evolution rather than a singular event."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nwhen did ireland gain its independence from england\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n[\"A brief period of limited independence for Ireland came to an end following the Irish Rebellion of 1798, which occurred during the British war with revolutionary France.

However, King George III was bitterly opposed to any such Emancipation and succeeded in defeating his government's attempts to introduce it.\n", "A year later on 6 December 1922, the Irish Free State became independent of the United Kingdom in accordance with the Treaty, which was given legislative effect in the United Kingdom by the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922. The new state had the status of a dominion of the British Empire.\n", "Ireland gained a degree of independence in the 1780s thanks to Henry Grattan. During this time the effects of the penal laws on the primarily Roman Catholic population were reduced, and some property-owning Catholics were granted the franchise in 1794; however, they were still excluded from becoming members of the Irish House of Commons. This brief period of limited independence came to an end following the Irish Rebellion of 1798, which occurred during the British war with revolutionary France. The British government's fear of an independent Ireland siding against them with the French resulted in the decision to unite the two countries.

The nation had gained \"de facto\" independence from Britain after the Anglo-Irish War, and the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 declared Ireland to be a 'sovereign, independent, democratic state'. A new constitution was adopted by a plebiscite in 1937. The Statute of Westminster meant that unlike in World War I, Britain's entry into the war no longer automatically included its dominions. Relations between Ireland and Britain had been strained for many years; until 1938 the two states had engaged in the Anglo-Irish Trade War.\n", "BULLET::::- Irish Free State gains independence from the United Kingdom in 1922.\n", "In 1800, as a result of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, the Act of Union merged the kingdom of Great Britain and the kingdom of Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The whole island of Ireland continued to be a part of the United Kingdom until 1922, when what is now the Republic of Ireland won independence as the Irish Free State, a separate Dominion within the Commonwealth. The Irish Free State was renamed \u00c9ire (or \"Ireland\") in 1937, and in 1949 declared itself a republic, left the Commonwealth and severed all ties with the monarchy. Northern Ireland remained within the Union. In 1927, the United Kingdom changed its name to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, while the monarch's style for the next twenty years became \"of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India\".\n", "19th century violent and constitutional campaigns for autonomy or independence culminated in an election in 1918 returning almost 70% of seats to Sinn F\u00e9in, who declared Irish independence from Britain and set up a parliament in Dublin, and declared the independence of Ireland from the United Kingdom. A war of independence followed that ended with the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1922, which partitioned Ireland between the Irish Free State, which gained dominion status within the British Empire, and a devolved administration in Northern Ireland, which remained part of the UK.

A Provisional Government was set up under the terms of the treaty, but the Irish Republic nominally remained in existence until 6 December 1922, when 26 of the island's 32 counties became a self-governing British Dominion called the Irish Free State. The island had been partitioned by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, and the six counties of Northern Ireland, which had been partitioned artificially so as to create and ensure a unionist majority, exercised their right under the Treaty to opt out of the Free State, and remain in the United Kingdom.\n"], "__answers__": ["In 1922", "1922"]}}
