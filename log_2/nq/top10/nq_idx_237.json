The British East India Company began establishing control over India in the 18th century, leading to various political movements and societies aimed at addressing the issues faced by Indians.\n\n1. **Early Political Organizations**: The Indian National Congress (INC), established in 1885, is often recognized as a significant political organization in the Indian independence movement. However, it was not the first. The **Indian Association**, founded in 1876 by Surendranath Banerjee in Calcutta, is considered one of the earliest political organizations that sought to promote Indian interests and represent Indian voices to the British authorities.\n\n2. **Calcutta-based Organizations**: The **Indian National Association** and the **British Indian Association** were also among the earliest political organizations in India.

The British East India Company established control over India in the 18th century, leading to various responses from Indian society, including the formation of political organizations aimed at addressing grievances and advocating for Indian interests.\n\n1. **Historical Context Specialist's View**: The British Indian Association, founded in 1851, is often highlighted as one of the earliest political organizations. It was crucial in articulating Indian concerns to the British government and set the stage for future political movements. This perspective emphasizes the role of formal organizations in the political landscape.\n\n2. **Nationalist Movements Scholar's Perspective**: The Indian National Association, established in 1905, is presented as a significant evolution in political organization, mobilizing a broader base of support and fostering national identity. This viewpoint suggests that while earlier organizations laid the groundwork, the Indian National Association represented a more organized and impactful political force.\n\n3. **Revolutionary Movements Expert's Contribution**: The emergence of revolutionary groups like the Anushilan Samity in the early 1900s introduces a different dimension to the discussion. These organizations aimed for radical change and were instrumental in the rise of militant nationalism. This perspective highlights the importance of revolutionary ideologies and actions in the broader context of resistance against British rule.\n\n4. **Socio-Political Analyst's Insight**: The duality of political expression\u2014both reformist and revolutionary\u2014is crucial in understanding the political landscape of colonial India. This perspective underscores the significance of various organizations, whether formal or informal, in galvanizing support for independence.\n\n5. **Cultural and Intellectual Movements Scholar's Emphasis**: The role of intellectual movements, such as those led by Ram Mohan Roy and the Young Bengal movement, is vital in understanding the ideological foundations of political societies. These movements fostered political consciousness and created an environment conducive to the emergence of political organizations.\n\n**Synthesis of Insights**: The discussion reveals that the political landscape in colonial India was complex and multifaceted. While the British Indian Association is often recognized as one of the first formal political organizations, the Indian Association (founded in 1876) also played a crucial role in advocating for Indian interests. Additionally, the Indian National Association and revolutionary groups like Anushilan Samity contributed significantly to the evolution of political consciousness and action against British rule.\n\nThe interplay between reformist and revolutionary ideologies illustrates that the struggle for independence was not monolithic; it involved diverse approaches and strategies. The contributions of intellectual movements further enrich our understanding of how political societies emerged and evolved in response to colonial rule.\n\n**Conclusion**: Based on the enriched synthesis of expert insights, the Indian Association, founded in 1876, is recognized as one of the first political societies under British rule in India. However, it is essential to acknowledge the significance of the British Indian Association (1851) and the Indian National Association (1905) in shaping the political discourse of the time. This nuanced understanding enhances our appreciation of the historical dynamics at play during this pivotal period in Indian history.\n\n**Answer**: The Indian Association, founded in 1876, is often recognized as one of the first political societies started under British rule in India, alongside the British Indian Association established in 1851."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nthe first political society started under british rule in india was\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The first Scientific Society of India was established first in Ghazipur in 1862 by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan for propagating modern Western knowledge of science, technology and industry.

The British East India Company began establishing control over India in the 18th century, leading to various political movements.\n\nWhile the \"Indian National Congress\" (INC) was established in 1885 and is often recognized as a significant political organization, it is essential to acknowledge earlier organizations that sought to address Indian issues under British rule. One notable example is the \"Indian Association,\" founded in 1876 by Surendranath Banerjee in Calcutta (now Kolkata). This association aimed to promote Indian interests and represent Indian voices to the British authorities.\n\nHowever, the retrieved passages indicate that there were other organizations that also played crucial roles in the political landscape. The **Indian National Association** is mentioned as one of the earliest political organizations in India, which could suggest that it also holds significance in this context. Additionally, the **British Indian Association**, established earlier, is noted as one of the first political organizations, further complicating the narrative of which society can be considered the \"first.\"\n\nMoreover, the passages highlight the emergence of political consciousness in Bengal and the formation of secret societies like the **Anushilan Samity**, which indicates a broader and more organized political resistance than previously recognized. The **Free India Society**, while primarily an organization of Indian students in England, reflects the transnational nature of political activism during this period.\n\nIn summary, while the Indian Association (1876) is a strong candidate for the title of the first political society under British rule, the Indian National Association and the British Indian Association also play significant roles in the early political landscape. Therefore, the model should recognize the complexity of this history and the contributions of multiple organizations.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe Indian Association, founded in 1876, is often recognized as one of the first political societies started under British rule in India. However, the Indian National Association and the British Indian Association also emerged as significant early political organizations, contributing to the political landscape during this period."}], "question_info": {"question": "the first political society started under british rule in india was", "passages": ["The first Scientific Society of India was established first in Ghazipur in 1862 by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan for propagating modern Western knowledge of science, technology and industry. It was a departure from the past in the sense that education made a paradigm shift from traditional humanities and related disciplines to the new field of science and agriculture. Some current institution like Technical Education and Research Institute (TERI), part of post-graduate college PG College Ghazipur, in the city, takes their inspiration from that first Society.\n", "The Free India Society was a political organization of Indian students in England, committed to obtaining the independence of India from British rule.Initially an intellectual group, it became a revolutionary outfit under its founding leader, Madam Bhikaji Cama.\n", "Filmmaker Satyajit Ray founded the first Indian film society, the Calcutta Film Society in 1947.

By 1902, Calcutta had three secret societies working toward the violent overthrow of British rule in India. These included the \"Anushilan Samity\", founded by a Calcutta student named Satish Chandra Basu with the patronage of the Calcutta barrister Pramatha Mitra, another led by a Bengalee lady by the name of Sarala Devi, and a third one founded by Aurobindo Ghosh. Ghosh was one of the strongest proponents of militant nationalism at the time. Having forsaken a potential career in the Indian Civil Service, Ghosh had returned to India and taken up an academic post under the patronage of the Maharaja of Baroda. Here he came to develop a close relationship with Indian Maratha nationalist Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and through him the nationalist network in Maharashtra. Inspired by the histories of Italian and Irish nationalism, Aurobindo began preparing the grounds and network for an Indian nationalist revolution, in which he found support in Tilak. Aurobindo sought for source of military training to prepare for a revolution in future. His younger brother Barin joined Aurobindo in Baroda. Baroda offered Barin to obtain training in military strategies and armed conflicts.In 1903, Aurobindo Ghosh sent his younger brother Barindra Kumar Ghosh to Calcutta to rally the nascent organisation. By 1905, the controversial 1905 partition of Bengal had a widespread political impact: it stimulated radical nationalist sentiments in the \"Bhadralok\" community in Bengal, and helped \"Anushilan\" acquire a support base among of educated, politically conscious and disaffected young in local youth societies throughout Bengal. The works of Aurobindo and his brother Barin Ghosh allowed \"Anushilan Samity\" to spread through Bengal. \"Anushilan\" began a program of slowly building a support base, preparing slowly and steadily for a nationalist uprising, on the lines of the Italian \"Carbonari\".\n", "The British India Society was set up in 1839 in England primarily as a result of the efforts of William Adam, who had come to India and befriended Ram Mohan Roy.

Ghosh was one of the strongest proponents of militant Indian nationalism at the time. By 1905 the work of Aurobindo and his brother, Barin, enabled Anushilan Samity to spread throughout Bengal. Nationalist writings and publications by Aurobindo and Barin, including \"Bande Mataram\" and \"Jugantar\", had a widespread influence on Bengal youth. The 1905 partition of Bengal stimulated radical nationalist sentiments in Bengal's Bhadralok community, helping Anushilan acquire a support base of educated, politically-conscious and disaffected members of local youth societies. Its program emphasized physical training, training its recruits with daggers and \"lathis\" (bamboo staffs used as weapons). The Dhaka branch of Anushilan was led by Pulin Behari Das, and branches spread throughout East Bengal and Assam. More than 500 branches were opened in eastern Bengal and Assam, linked by \"close and detailed organization\" to Pulin's headquarters at Dhaka. It absorbed smaller groups in the province, soon overshadowing its parent organisation in Calcutta. Branches of Dhaka Anushilan emerged in Jessore, Khulna, Faridpur, Rajnagar, Rajendrapur, Mohanpur, Barvali and Bakarganj. Estimates of Dhaka Anushilan Samiti's reach indicate a membership of 15,000 to 20,000. Within two years, Dhaka Anushilan devolved its aims from the Swadeshi to that of political terrorism.\n", "Until 1991, over 20 years ago, there was no representation for Hindu students at a campus level and so the first Hindu society, at London School of Economics, was set up to cater for these needs.
