However, it is positioned more inland between certain states, which allows it to connect suburban areas and smaller cities that may not be directly served by I-95. This aspect highlights its role in local traffic and urban connectivity, especially in states like Virginia and Pennsylvania, where it serves as a major arterial road for suburban communities.\n\n**Expert C: Variations in Route Designation**\nWhile US 1 has a consistent starting point in Key West and an endpoint in Fort Kent, there are variations in how the route is designated in different states. For example, in New York, US 1 has a complex history of designation and routing, initially ending at the 42nd Street Ferry before being extended to the George Washington Bridge. This illustrates the evolving nature of highway designations and the impact of infrastructure developments, such as the opening of the Holland Tunnel.\n\n**Expert D: Current Relevance and Traffic Patterns**\nIn contemporary terms, US 1 has seen shifts in its relevance due to the parallel Interstate system. In states like Virginia, US 1 primarily serves local traffic, as I-95 has taken over much of the long-distance travel. This raises questions about the future of US 1 as a major highway, especially in urban areas where it may be overshadowed by more modern routes.\n\n**Points of Agreement**\nAll experts agree on the fundamental starting and ending points of US 1, recognizing its importance as a major highway along the East Coast. They also concur that US 1 serves both long-distance and local traffic, although the balance of this service varies by region.\n\n**Points of Disagreement**\nThe experts differ on the highway's current relevance and future trajectory. While some argue that US 1 remains vital for local connectivity, others suggest that its role is diminishing in favor of interstate highways. Additionally, the historical context provided by Expert A contrasts with the contemporary focus of Expert D, who emphasizes current traffic patterns and usage.\n\n**Synthesis of Insights**\nThe discussion reveals that U.S. Route 1 is not just a simple highway; it is a complex entity shaped by historical developments, geographic significance, and evolving traffic patterns. Its role has shifted from a primary route for long-distance travel to a more localized service in many areas, particularly as interstate highways have become dominant. The historical context enriches our understanding of how infrastructure evolves over time and how it adapts to changing transportation needs.\n\n**Conclusion**\nIn summary, U.S. Highway 1 starts in Key West, Florida, and ends in Fort Kent, Maine.

U.S. Route 1 is a major north-south highway in the United States, primarily serving the East Coast.\n\n1. **Southern Terminus**: Historically, US Highway 1 has been recognized as starting in Key West, Florida, which is the southernmost point in the contiguous United States. This point is significant not only geographically but also symbolically, as it represents the beginning of a major transportation route.\n\n2. **Northern Terminus**: The northern endpoint of US Highway 1 is at Fort Kent, Maine, near the Canadian border. This endpoint is consistent across various sources and reflects the highway's role in connecting the southern and northern extremes of the East Coast.\n\n3. **Variations in Route Designation**: While the starting and ending points are generally agreed upon, there are nuances in how the route is designated in different states. For instance, in New York, US 1 has undergone changes in its routing and designation over the years, which can lead to confusion about its exact path in urban areas.\n\n4. **Current Relevance**: The highway's role has evolved, particularly with the rise of the Interstate system. In many areas, US 1 now serves more local traffic, especially in states like Virginia, where it is often overshadowed by I-95. This shift raises questions about the future importance of US 1 as a major thoroughfare.\n\n5. **Expert Perspectives**: The discussion among experts highlights the highway's historical significance, its geographic importance in connecting urban and suburban areas, and the ongoing challenges it faces in maintaining relevance against modern infrastructure. \n\n6. **Points of Agreement and Disagreement**: All experts agree on the fundamental starting and ending points of US 1. However, they differ on its current relevance, with some emphasizing its importance for local connectivity while others suggest its role is diminishing due to the dominance of interstate highways.\n\n**Answer:**\nU.S. Highway 1 starts in Key West, Florida, and ends in Fort Kent, Maine, at the Canadian border. This highway serves as a vital transportation route along the East Coast, connecting major cities and suburban areas. While it has historically been a significant thoroughfare, its role has evolved, and it now primarily serves local traffic in many regions, particularly where it parallels Interstate 95.

In the U.S. state of New York, US\u00a01 extends from the George Washington Bridge in Manhattan to the Connecticut state line at Port Chester. It closely parallels Interstate\u00a095 (I-95) for much of its course, and does not serve as a major trunk road within the state. It is not concurrent with any other highways besides I-95 and (briefly) US\u00a09, and few other state highways intersect it.\n", "U.S. Route\u00a01 or U.S. Highway 1 (US\u00a01) is a major north\u2013south U.S. Highway that serves the East Coast of the United States.

US\u00a01 is generally paralleled by Interstate 95 (I-95), though the former is significantly farther west (inland) between Jacksonville, Florida, and Petersburg, Virginia. The highway connects most of the major cities of the East Coast\u2014including Miami, Jacksonville, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, Boston and Portland, passing from the Southeastern United States to New England.\n", "In 1926, the U.S. Highway system was established. US\u00a01 in New York was designated from Jersey City, New Jersey, through New York City and lower Westchester, to Greenwich, Connecticut. Old NY\u00a01 was incorporated into the new US\u00a01. However, because New York city did not post route numbers, US\u00a01 ended at the 42nd Street Ferry landing in Weehawken (where the old Lincoln Highway crossed into the city) and resumed again at the Bronx\u2013Westchester boundary. By 1928, the Holland Tunnel opened and the end of US\u00a01 on the New Jersey side was moved there.\n", "U.S. Route 1 (US 1) is a United States highway which parallels the East Coast of the United States, running from Key West, Florida in the south to Fort Kent, Maine at the Canadian border in the north. Of the entire length of the route, of it runs through New Jersey. It enters the state from Pennsylvania on the Trenton\u2013Morrisville Toll Bridge over the Delaware River in the state capital of Trenton, running through the city on the Trenton Freeway. From here, US 1 continues northeast as a surface divided highway through suburban areas continuing into Middlesex County and passing through New Brunswick and Edison. US 1 merges with US 9 in Woodbridge, and the two routes continue through northern New Jersey as US 1/9 to the George Washington Bridge over the Hudson River in Fort Lee. At this point, the road continues into New York City along with I-95.\n", "The Interior section of Highway 1 is long, and closely follows the path of the Canadian Pacific Railway. After leaving the freeway, Highway 1 courses through the town centre of Hope for 2\u00a0km (1\u00bc\u00a0mi) before heading north across the Fraser River. At this point, Highway 1 becomes two lanes. 1\u00a0km (about \u00bd mi) north of the Fraser crossing, Highway 1 reaches its east junction with Highway 7. Continuing from the Highway 7 junction, Highway 1 goes north on a route that includes seven mountain tunnels, past the communities of Yale, Spuzzum and Boston Bar, before reaching its junction with Highway 12 at Lytton. Leaving the Fraser River, and following the Thompson River another northeast, Highway 1 reaches a junction with another numbered route, Highway 8. north of the Highway 8 junction, Highway 1 passes through a junction with Highway 97C. Continuing north, the highway reaches the community of Cache Creek, where Highway 97 merges onto the Trans-Canada from the north.\n", "U.S. Highway 175 (US\u00a0175) is an east-west United States Numbered Highway completely within the state of Texas. It comes very close to meeting its parent route, US 75, but decommissioning and rerouting in Downtown Dallas brings it a couple of miles short. Before the decommissioning of US 75 south of downtown Dallas in favor of Interstate 45 (I-45), US 175 met US 75. US 175's western terminus is in Dallas at I-45.

In the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, US 1 runs for from the Maryland state line near Nottingham to the New Jersey state line near Trenton, through the southeastern portion of the state. The route runs southwest to northeast, and serves as a major arterial road for many of the suburbs in the Delaware Valley area. South of Philadelphia, the road mostly follows the alignment of the old Baltimore Pike. Within Philadelphia, it mostly follows Roosevelt Boulevard.\n", "The southern terminus is at US 1 in Portsmouth. The northern terminus is at US 1 in Kittery. Between its termini, US 1 Bypass intersects Interstate 95, U.S. Route 4, New Hampshire Route 16, and the Spaulding Turnpike in Portsmouth, as well as State Route 103 in Kittery.\n", "Its southern terminus is in Fort Worth, Texas, at an intersection with I-35W and US 287. Between the inception of the numbered highway system in 1926 through 1991, US 81's southern terminus was at the Mexican border in Laredo, Texas. In 1991, the terminus was moved to San Antonio. The route was shortened to its present length of in 1993, when the terminus was moved to Fort Worth. In both cases, the dropped portions of US\u00a081 were replaced by I-35.
