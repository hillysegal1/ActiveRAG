However, it is classified as an observation tower and not a fully habitable building.\n\n2. **Identify the Tallest Building**:\n   - The **Drew Las Vegas** is recognized as the tallest building in Las Vegas, having been topped out in November 2008. However, it has faced construction delays and has not been completed, which complicates its status as the tallest building.\n\n3. **Consider Completed Buildings**:\n   - The tallest completed building in Las Vegas is the **Palazzo**, which stands at 642 feet (196 meters) and was completed in 2007. This height is significant when comparing it to the Drew Las Vegas, which remains unfinished.\n\n4. **Construction Status and Future Developments**:\n   - The Drew Las Vegas has been the tallest building since its topping out but has not yet opened.
