The leading scorer is typically identified based on the total points accumulated over multiple tournament appearances, which reflects not only individual scoring ability but also the player's impact on their team's success during those tournaments.\n\nHistorically, this record has been held by players who demonstrated exceptional scoring talent during their college careers. As of my last knowledge update in October 2023, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (formerly known as Lew Alcindor) is recognized as the all-time leading scorer in NCAA tournament history, having scored a total of 564 points in tournament games. His scoring prowess during the tournaments in the late 1960s and early 1970s contributed significantly to his team's success and solidified his legacy in NCAA history.\n\nIn addition to Abdul-Jabbar, it is important to acknowledge that there are separate records for men's and women's NCAA basketball, as highlighted by the achievements of players like Lynette Woodard and Jackie Stiles. This distinction is crucial for understanding the broader context of scoring records in NCAA history.\n\nFurthermore, the evolution of scoring records over time, including the impact of historical contexts such as the \"golden age\" of NAIA tournaments and the exclusion of AIAW statistics, illustrates the complexities involved in record-keeping. This understanding enhances our ability to critically assess the significance of various achievements and the players behind them.\n\nBy analyzing these factors, we can draw causal relationships between a player's scoring ability, their performance in tournaments, and their recognition as a leading scorer. This comparative analysis allows us to appreciate the nuances of NCAA scoring records and the historical context in which they were achieved.\n\n### Answer:\nThe all-time leading scorer in NCAA tournament history is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (formerly known as Lew Alcindor), with a total of 564 points scored in NCAA tournament games."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwho is the all time leading scorer in ncaa tournament history\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n[\"In 2008, Duke's Matt Danowski surpassed Vasta as the all-time leading scorer.
