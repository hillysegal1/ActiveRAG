The Berlin Conference of 1884-1885 is a pivotal event where European powers convened to partition Africa among themselves, disregarding existing ethnic, cultural, and political boundaries.\n\n2. **Role of Colonial Powers**:\n   - Major colonial powers, including Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Portugal, and Italy, were responsible for drawing these borders. They did so based on their own strategic interests, often leading to arbitrary divisions that did not reflect the realities on the ground. For example, the Niger-Chad border was created by French military commanders, illustrating how specific borders were often determined by colonial administrative decisions rather than local needs.\n\n3. **Consequences of Arbitrary Borders**:\n   - The arbitrary nature of these borders has had lasting impacts, including the splitting of ethnic groups and the creation of tensions that have led to conflicts. The assertion that Africa will continue to suffer from wars due to the irrationality of its borders underscores the ongoing instability linked to these colonial legacies.\n\n4. **Post-Colonial Legacy**:\n   - After gaining independence in the mid-20th century, many African countries retained the borders established during colonial rule. This retention was influenced by the Organization of African Unity (now the African Union), which adopted a principle of respecting existing borders to avoid conflicts that could arise from redrawing them. This reflects a complex legacy where, despite the recognition of the injustice of colonial borders, there is a consensus among African leaders to maintain them to prevent further conflict.\n\n5. **Cartographic Evolution**:\n   - The historical perspective on cartography reveals how Africa was perceived and represented before and during colonialism. Maps prior to the 18th century often depicted African kingdoms with assumed or contrived boundaries, while later maps began to reflect the arbitrary divisions imposed by colonial powers. This evolution in cartography is foundational for understanding the later imposition of borders.\n\n6. **Modern Implications**:\n   - The modern paradox of maintaining these arbitrary borders, despite their problematic origins, highlights the complexities of national identity and governance in Africa today. While the borders are recognized as unjust, they have become entrenched in the political landscape, complicating efforts for reform.\n\n### Answer:\nThe borders of Africa's countries were primarily created by European colonial powers during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly at the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885.

This retention was influenced by the Organization of African Unity's (now the African Union) principle of respecting existing borders to prevent conflicts that could arise from redrawing them.\n\n4. **Contemporary Implications**: The arbitrary nature of these borders has led to ongoing ethnic conflicts and instability, as they often group diverse ethnic groups together or split others apart. Experts highlight the paradox of maintaining these borders; while they are seen as a source of conflict, altering them could lead to even greater instability.\n\n5. **Cultural and Ethnographic Considerations**: The borders created by colonial powers do not align with the demographic and ethnographic realities of Africa. This has resulted in a need for a deeper understanding of the cultural and social fabric of African societies when discussing the implications of these borders.\n\n6. **Historical Cartography**: The role of historical cartography is significant, as the act of map-making was a form of power that reinforced European dominance. Early maps depicted undefined boundaries, and the subsequent imposition of colonial borders represented a continuation of this practice.\n\n7. **Expert Consensus and Divergence**: There is a consensus among experts that the borders were largely created by colonial powers and do not reflect the continent's ethnic and cultural realities. However, there is divergence regarding the implications of maintaining these borders\u2014some argue for their necessity to avoid conflict, while others advocate for a reevaluation of these boundaries to address historical injustices.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe borders of Africa's countries were primarily created by European colonial powers during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly at the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885. These borders were drawn arbitrarily, often ignoring the continent's complex ethnic and cultural landscapes. After gaining independence, many African nations retained these colonial borders due to the principle established by the Organization of African Unity, which aimed to prevent conflicts that could arise from redrawing boundaries. The legacy of these arbitrary borders continues to influence social and political dynamics in Africa, leading to ongoing ethnic tensions and instability.

This has led to significant challenges, including ethnic tensions and divisions among communities."}], "question_info": {"question": "who created the borders of africa's countries", "passages": ["BULLET::::- The Niger-Chad border was created by French military commanders and the Governors-General of French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa.\n", "He argues that states must create new borders, uniting each separate people within one country. In Africa especially, borders were created by European administrators and are not related to the various peoples.\n", "Jeffrey Herbst has written extensively on the impact of state organization in Africa. He notes, because the borders were artificially created, they generally do not conform to \u201ctypical demographic, ethnographic, and topographic boundaries.\u201d Instead, they were manufactured by colonialists to advance their political goals. This led to large scale issues, like the division of ethnic groups; and small scale issues, such as families\u2019 homes being separated from their farms.\n", "During the 1930s and 1940s many intellectuals partook in the theoretical formulation of Afrikaner nationalism. Nicolaas Johannes Diederichs, who later became South Africa's president, formulated Afrikaner nationalistic ideology in his book \"\"Nationalism as a Worldview and Its Relationship to Internationalism\"\" through Kuyperian theology. According to Diederichs, God created nations and these nations had a God-ordained right to exist as separate entities. Therefore, Afrikaners could refuse a \"British-designed\" South Africa in which they would co-exist with other ethnic groups as a minority. Geoffrey Cronje developed these ideas further and argued, that as long as the Afrikaner existed as a minority in a racially and culturally different environment, they could not allow the black majority to develop economically or politically, since this would lead to black domination. He acknowledged this as unjust and unchristian, and as a solution offered total segregation, that is apartheid, between the blacks and the whites.\n", "The book argues that Africa will continue to suffer from wars due to the irrationality of its borders, which were drawn by colonial powers, which do not take into account tribal and ethnic loyalties. According to Friedman, Africa will gradually reshape itself into a continent of stable nations, including a few major powers, and that the best policy is to simply leave Africa alone and provide humanitarian assistance, and allow the continent's borders to be gradually rearranged through warfare.\n", "During the Berlin Conference in 1884-85 Africa was carved up between the European colonial powers, defining boundaries that are largely intact with today's post-colonial states. On 5 August 1890 the British and French concluded an agreement to clarify the boundary between French West Africa and what would become Nigeria. A boundary was agreed along a line from Say on the Niger to Barruwa on Lake Chad, but leaving the Sokoto Caliphate in the British sphere. Parfait-Louis Monteil was given charge of an expedition to discover where this line actually ran. On 9 April 1892 he reached Kukawa on the shore of the lake. Over the next twenty years a large part of the Chad Basin was incorporated by treaty or by force into French West Africa. On 2 June 1909 the Wadai capital of Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9 was occupied by the French. The remainder of the basin was divided by the British in Nigeria who took Kano in 1903, and the Germans in Kameroun. The countries of the basin regained their independence between 1956 and 1962, retaining the colonial administrative boundaries.\n", "In 1985, prompted by economic uncertainties and a rising crime rate, the government of Buhari opened the borders (closed since April 1984) with Benin, Niger, Chad and Cameroon to speed up the expulsion of 700,000 illegal foreigners and illegal migrant workers. Buhari is today known for this crisis; there even is a famine in the east of Niger that have been named \"El Buhari\".\n", "Before 1749, maps of the African continent had African kingdoms drawn with assumed or contrived boundaries, with unknown or unexplored areas having drawings of animals, imaginary physical geographic features, and descriptive texts. In 1748, Jean B. B. d'Anville created the first map of the African continent that had blank spaces to represent the unknown territory. This was revolutionary in cartography and the representation of power associated with map making.\n", "Herbst notes a modern paradox regarding the colonial borders in Africa: while they are arbitrary there is a consensus among African leaders that they must be maintained. Organization of African Unity in 1963 cemented colonial boundaries permanently by proclaiming that any changes made were illegitimate. This, in effect, avoided readdressing the basic injustice of colonial partition, while also reducing the likelihood of inter-state warfare as territorial boundaries were considered immutable by the international community.\n", "The White Fathers then left Ghadames. On 25 March 1890, while the Brussels conference against slavery was being held, Mgr Lavigerie explained in a letter to Keller that to eradicate in Africa the great Muslim corporation of the Senussi, which protected the slave-trade, the Sahara must be crossed, and he announced the opening at Biskra in Algeria, at the entrance to the Sahara, of a so-called House of God, intended for the formation of the \"Brothers of the Sahara\" or \"Pioneers of the Sahara\", who would engage in charitable works and in extending hospitality to travelers, the sick and fugitive slaves. The Pioneers of the Sahara had to live as religious, but without monastic vows. As early as February, 1891, the station at Ouargla, also in northern Algeria, suppressed in 1876, was re-established, and in October Father Harquard sent thither six armed \"pioneers\" who wrote to the cardinal: \"We shall endeavor to hold high the banner of the Sacred Heart and the flag of France.\" The White Sisters founded hospitals at Gharda\u00efa and El Tbiod Sidi Cheikh, thus gaining the confidence of populations which were hostile to France.\n"], "__answers__": ["European imperial powers"]}}
