However, based on the retrieved knowledge, Dwight Schrute's actual brother is named Jeb, portrayed by Thomas Middleditch. This is a crucial distinction, as Mose is a separate character who is also related to Dwight but is not his brother. \n\nIn the context of \"The Office,\" it is important to clarify that while Mose is a notable character who appears frequently and is known for his eccentricities, he is Dwight's cousin, not his brother.
