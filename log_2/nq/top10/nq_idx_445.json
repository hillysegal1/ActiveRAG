This establishes a long history of the method as a means of capital punishment in the state.\n\n2. **Operational Duration**:\n   - The electric chair was operational for 75 years, during which 695 executions were carried out, primarily at Sing Sing prison. This highlights the method's extensive use and societal acceptance during that period.\n\n3. **Last Execution**:\n   - The last execution by electric chair occurred on August 15, 1963, with Eddie Lee Mays being the final individual executed by this method. This marks a significant point in the timeline, indicating the end of an era for this execution method in New York.\n\n4. **Abolition of Capital Punishment**:\n   - New York abolished capital punishment in 1965, just two years after the last execution by electric chair. This indicates a shift in societal attitudes towards the death penalty, suggesting that the last execution may have influenced the decision to abolish the practice.\n\n5. **Reinstatement and Subsequent Changes**:\n   - Capital punishment was reinstated in 1995, but only lethal injection was used. The electric chair was not part of this reinstatement, indicating a shift away from older methods of execution. The practice was abolished again in 2004 after a ruling by the Court of Appeals, which deemed it unconstitutional. This further emphasizes the evolving legal and ethical landscape surrounding capital punishment.\n\n6. **Current Status**:\n   - No executions took place during the nine years following the reinstatement of capital punishment, indicating a lack of implementation of the death penalty in New York during that period.\n\n### Causal Relationships:\n- The timeline of events illustrates a clear causal relationship: the last execution by electric chair led to the abolition of capital punishment in 1965, and subsequent legal rulings further shaped the landscape of capital punishment in New York.\n\n### Enhanced Reasoning:\n- By understanding the historical context and operational history of the electric chair, the model can better infer the societal and legal implications of its use and eventual discontinuation. The model can also recognize patterns in public opinion and legal decisions that influence capital punishment practices.\n\n### Answer:\nNew York officially stopped using the electric chair after the last execution on August 15, 1963. The state abolished capital punishment in 1965, which meant that the electric chair was no longer used after that point. Although capital punishment was reinstated in 1995, it exclusively utilized lethal injection, and the electric chair was never used again."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhen did new york stop using the electric chair\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['In its 75 years of operation, a total of 695 men and women were executed by the electric chair in New York state (614 at Sing Sing).
