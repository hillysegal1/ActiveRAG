Both muscles are crucial for plantar flexion of the foot, which is the movement that points the toes downward.\n\nIn the context of anatomical terminology, the term \"calf muscle\" can refer to either of these muscles, but it is most commonly associated with the gastrocnemius due to its size and visibility.
