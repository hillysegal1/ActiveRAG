From the late 1960s to the late 1970s, aluminum wiring was widely adopted in residential construction due to its lower cost compared to copper.

The industry eventually reverted to copper wiring, which is considered safer and more reliable.\n\n**Expert 2: Electrical Safety Advocate**\nI agree with Expert 1 on the safety concerns surrounding aluminum wiring. The fires associated with aluminum wiring were primarily due to poor connections and the metal's tendency to expand and contract, which could loosen connections over time. This raises important questions about building codes and regulations. In Ontario, the adoption of stricter electrical codes in the late 1970s and early 1980s likely contributed to the decline in aluminum wiring usage.

However, based on the historical context and regulatory changes, it can be concluded that aluminum wiring was largely phased out in Ontario by the early 1980s.\n\n### Answer:\nAluminum wiring was largely phased out in Ontario by the early 1980s, influenced by safety concerns and subsequent regulatory changes in building codes."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhen did they stop using aluminum wiring in ontario\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['Also in April 2007, Duncan announced that Ontario would ban the sale of inefficient incandescent light bulbs by 2012.

It was favored for its cost-effectiveness compared to copper wiring. However, safety issues emerged, particularly related to overheating and fire hazards, leading to concerns about its use.\n\n2. **Regulatory Changes**: The decline in the use of aluminum wiring was influenced by safety concerns that prompted changes in regulations. The Canadian Electrical Code and local building codes were updated to address these safety issues, which would have included guidelines on the use of aluminum wiring.\n\n3. **Timeline of Changes**: The passage indicates that aluminum wiring was used in housing construction in America from the late 1960s to the late 1970s. While it does not provide specific information about Ontario, it suggests that similar trends may have occurred. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, many jurisdictions, including Ontario, began to discourage or prohibit the use of aluminum wiring in new residential construction due to the associated risks.\n\n4. **Current Standards**: To pinpoint when aluminum wiring was officially phased out in Ontario, it would be essential to review specific amendments to the Canadian Electrical Code or Ontario's building codes that addressed aluminum wiring. This would provide a clearer timeline and confirm when regulations were enacted to limit or ban its use.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the historical context, safety concerns, and regulatory changes, it can be inferred that aluminum wiring was largely phased out in Ontario by the early 1980s. However, the exact date of regulatory changes would require further investigation into the specific amendments to building codes.\n\n### Answer:\nAluminum wiring was largely phased out in Ontario by the early 1980s due to safety concerns related to overheating and fire hazards. While specific regulatory changes in Ontario are not detailed in the retrieved passages, it is reasonable to conclude that similar trends observed in other jurisdictions occurred in Ontario as well. For precise dates and regulations, further investigation into the Canadian Electrical Code and local building codes would be necessary."}], "question_info": {"question": "when did they stop using aluminum wiring in ontario", "passages": ["Also in April 2007, Duncan announced that Ontario would ban the sale of inefficient incandescent light bulbs by 2012.
