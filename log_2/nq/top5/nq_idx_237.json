This indicates an early movement towards modernization and intellectual awakening in India, which could be seen as a precursor to political consciousness.\n\n2. **Free India Society**: Formed by Indian students in England, this society was initially an intellectual group that evolved into a revolutionary outfit under Madam Bhikaji Cama.

The British East India Company began to exert control over India in the 18th century, leading to a growing awareness of political rights among Indians.\n\n1. **Historical Context**: The Indian National Congress (INC), founded in 1885, is often recognized as a significant political organization advocating for Indian rights. However, it was not the first. Prior to the INC, several organizations emerged to address the grievances of Indians under British rule.\n\n2. **Indian Association**: Founded in 1876 by Surendranath Banerjee and others in Calcutta, the Indian Association is one of the earliest political societies. It aimed to advocate for Indian rights and political representation, making it a crucial player in the early political landscape of India.\n\n3. **First Scientific Society of India**: Established in 1862 by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, this society focused on modern education and scientific knowledge. While not a political society in the traditional sense, it played a pivotal role in fostering political consciousness and modernization, which laid the groundwork for future political movements.\n\n4. **Free India Society**: Formed by Indian students in England, this society evolved from an intellectual group into a revolutionary outfit. Its transformation signifies the impact of education and diaspora on political activism, highlighting the interconnectedness of various movements.\n\n5. **Anushilan Samity**: By 1902, this secret society in Calcutta was part of a broader nationalist movement, advocating for the violent overthrow of British rule. Its formation was influenced by the growing political consciousness in Bengal, particularly in response to events like the partition of Bengal in 1905.\n\n### Causal Relationships:\n- The establishment of societies like the Indian Association and the Anushilan Samity illustrates a causal relationship between the socio-political environment and the emergence of organized resistance against colonial rule.\n- The evolution of these societies from intellectual discussions to active political engagement demonstrates how ideas can catalyze action, leading to significant political transformations.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy synthesizing these insights, we can conclude that the Indian Association, founded in 1876, is recognized as one of the earliest political societies established under British rule in India. This understanding enhances the model's ability to reason about causality and make logical inferences regarding the development of political movements.\n\n### Answer:\nThe first political society started under British rule in India was the Indian Association, founded in 1876."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nthe first political society started under british rule in india was\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The first Scientific Society of India was established first in Ghazipur in 1862 by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan for propagating modern Western knowledge of science, technology and industry.
