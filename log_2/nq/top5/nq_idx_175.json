This distinction is important to avoid confusion with \"Dakar\" in Senegal. The model should recognize that these are two different locations and ensure that users are not misled by the similarity in names.\n\n5. **Reinforcing the Location**: Finally, I will confirm that Dakar is not only the capital of Senegal but also a significant cultural and economic center in West Africa. This reinforces its importance and helps contextualize its location on a world map.\n\n**Answer**: \nDakar is located in West Africa, specifically on the Cape Verde Peninsula in Senegal, along the Atlantic coast. It is situated at approximately 14.6928\u00b0 N latitude and 17.4467\u00b0 W longitude. It is important to note that \"Dakkar\" refers to a historical town in the Somali Region of Ethiopia and should not be confused with Dakar, the capital of Senegal."}], "question_info": {"question": "where is dakar located on the world map", "passages": ["Dakkar was a Somali historical town located in modern day of Somali Region in Ethiopia.\n", "Dakar Region\n", "Dakar\n", "Dakar\n", "Grand Dakar is a commune d'arrondissement of the city of Dakar, Senegal.\n"], "__answers__": ["Senegal", "on the Cap - Vert peninsula on the Atlantic coast", "14 \u00b0 41 \u2032 34 '' N 17 \u00b0 26 \u2032 48 '' W \ufeff / \ufeff 14.69278 \u00b0 N 17.44667 \u00b0 W", "the westernmost city in the Old World as well as on the African mainland"]}}
