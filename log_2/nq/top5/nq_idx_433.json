In November 2011, Major League Baseball announced the Astros would transition to the American League as part of a realignment strategy aimed at balancing the number of teams in each league and creating a more equitable schedule. This decision was influenced by the sale of the team to new owner Jim Crane, which was a significant factor in the league change.\n\nThe Astros' last season in the National League was in 2012, and they officially made the switch to the American League effective for the 2013 season. Upon their move, they were assigned to the American League West division, joining teams like the Texas Rangers.\n\nThis transition is part of a broader historical context where teams have shifted leagues, such as the Milwaukee Brewers moving from the American League to the National League in 1998. Understanding this context helps to illustrate that league changes are not isolated incidents but part of a larger trend in sports management.\n\nThe reasoning process involves recognizing the cause-and-effect relationship between the ownership change and the decision to move leagues. The model can also learn the importance of temporal sequencing, as the last season in the National League (2012) precedes the effective move to the American League (2013). Additionally, the model can categorize this event as significant in the history of Major League Baseball, enhancing its ability to relate similar events across different contexts.\n\n### Answer:\nThe Houston Astros changed from the National League to the American League in November 2011, with the transition taking effect for the 2013 season. Their last season in the National League was 2012, and they were assigned to the American League West division upon their move."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhen did the astros change from the national league to the american league\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The Major League Baseball postseason was expanded to include a second wild card team in each league beginning in the 2012 season.
