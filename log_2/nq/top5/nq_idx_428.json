This indicates that the first half of the season typically runs for a couple of months.\n   - The second half of Season 5 was reported to have premiered on **November 28, 2018**. This aligns with the common practice of television series to release the second half of a season approximately a year after the first half, maintaining viewer engagement and continuity.\n\n2. **Season Structure**:\n   - The fifth season consists of **20 episodes**, which is a standard length for many television seasons. This structure suggests that the episodes are divided into two halves, reinforcing the idea that the second half would follow the first in a predictable manner.\n\n3. **Renewal and Scheduling**:\n   - The series was renewed for a sixth season on **September 12, 2017**, prior to the premiere of Season 5.
