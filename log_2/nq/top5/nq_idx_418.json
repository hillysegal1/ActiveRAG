This understanding can help the model infer the implications of funding on road maintenance and accessibility.\n\n3. **State-Level Variations**:\n   - Besides federal toll roads, individual states such as Puebla, Veracruz, and Nuevo Le\u00f3n have their own toll roads. This indicates a decentralized approach to road management, which can affect travel options and costs depending on the region.\n\n4. **Highway Numbering System**:\n   - The numbering system for highways in Mexico is systematic, with odd numbers for north-south routes and even numbers for east-west routes. Toll expressways are denoted by adding \"D\" to the highway number (e.g., MX 150D). This structured approach allows for easier navigation and understanding of road types.\n\n5. **Functional Characteristics**:\n   - Toll roads often serve specific functions, such as bypassing congested areas, crossing major bridges, and providing direct connections between cities. Understanding these functions can help the model infer the strategic importance of toll roads in the transportation network.\n\n6. **Economic Implications**:\n   - The tolls collected on these roads can vary based on distance and specific routes, which ties into economic considerations for travelers. This knowledge allows the model to make inferences about travel costs and route selection based on economic factors.\n\n7. **Predictive Reasoning**:\n   - Recognizing that toll roads often run parallel to free roads enables the model to predict travel behavior based on cost considerations. For instance, travelers may choose toll roads for faster travel times despite the added expense.\n\n### Answer:\nIn Mexico, toll roads are commonly referred to as **\"autopistas\"** or **\"cuota\"** highways. These roads require drivers to pay a fee, which helps fund their construction and maintenance. The tolls can vary based on the distance traveled and the specific road. Understanding this terminology is crucial for travelers to navigate the road system effectively. Additionally, many states have their own toll roads, and the numbering system for highways includes a designation for toll routes, typically marked with a \"D\" to indicate they are toll expressways."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhat are the toll roads called in mexico\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['Two segments of Federal Highway 15D (M\u00e9xico-La Marquesa and Guadalajara-Tepic) are among the top five most expensive toll roads in Mexico, according to a 2016 analysis by Carmatch.\\n', 'Mexico has an extensive system of toll roads or Autopistas.
