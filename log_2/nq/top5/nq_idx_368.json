His establishment of Aten as the primary god marked a significant moment in the religious landscape, although it was met with resistance and largely reversed after his reign.\n\n2. **Osiris**: The passages indicate that Osiris became increasingly important during this period, particularly concerning beliefs about the afterlife. His role as the guarantor of life after death shifted the focus from the pharaoh to a deity, suggesting a more personal relationship between individuals and Osiris. This reflects a broader cultural shift towards individual ethical behavior being central to one's fate in the afterlife.\n\n3. **Amun**: Amun's rise to prominence during the New Kingdom, especially in Thebes, is crucial. His syncretization with Ra and the establishment of his temple at Karnak as the largest religious center in Egypt underscore his significance. The increasing power of the priesthood associated with Amun indicates that religion was intertwined with political authority, shaping governance in Egypt.\n\n4. **Ra**: Although Ra had been a central figure in earlier periods, the passages suggest a decline in his prominence during the New Kingdom, particularly in the face of Amun's rise. This shift illustrates the dynamic nature of Egyptian religious practices and the evolving hierarchy of deities.\n\n5. **Role of Temples and Priesthood**: The professionalization of the priesthood and the expansion of temple complexes during this time reflect the growing influence of religious institutions in society. The priests' control over wealth and resources allowed them to wield significant political power, further intertwining religion and governance.\n\n6. **Pyramid Texts**: The emergence of written religious texts, such as the Pyramid Texts, signifies the importance of documentation in shaping and preserving religious beliefs. These texts played a crucial role in the continuity of religious practices and the establishment of a shared cultural identity among the Egyptians.\n\nIn summary, while Akhenaten's introduction of Aten as a singular deity was a notable religious reform, the broader context of the New Kingdom reveals that figures like Osiris and Amun also played critical roles in shaping the religious landscape. The interplay between these deities, the evolving role of the priesthood, and the significance of written texts all contributed to the rich tapestry of religious life in Ancient Egypt during this period.\n\n### Answer:\nThe most important new religious figure of the New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt was Akhenaten, who introduced the worship of Aten as the sole deity, marking a significant shift towards monotheism.

This elevation of Amun was a response to the growing influence of Thebes and the professionalization of the priesthood, which allowed for a more sophisticated theological discourse.

The professionalization of the priesthood and Amun's syncretization with Ra positioned him as a central figure in both religion and politics. This perspective is valid, as it reflects the socio-political dynamics of the time, where Amun's influence extended beyond mere worship to encompass governance.\n\n2. **Osiris's Role in Afterlife Beliefs**: Expert 2 pointed out the growing importance of Osiris, particularly in relation to the afterlife. The shift from a king-centric view of the afterlife to one where individual ethics and relationships with Osiris became paramount signifies a profound change in religious thought. This perspective is crucial, as it highlights the evolving nature of personal spirituality and the democratization of religious beliefs, making Osiris a vital figure for the populace.\n\n3. **Ra's Enduring Significance**: Expert 3 reminded the panel of Ra's continued relevance, despite the rise of Amun and Osiris. The acknowledgment of Ra's role as the source of life and his historical significance in the pantheon underscores the continuity of traditional beliefs. This perspective is important as it illustrates that while new figures may rise in prominence, older deities often retain their significance within the broader religious framework.\n\n4. **Interplay Among Deities**: Expert 4 emphasized the dynamic interplay between these figures, suggesting that the religious landscape was not static but rather responsive to sociopolitical changes. This perspective enriches the discussion by framing the relationships among Amun, Osiris, and Ra as part of a complex web of beliefs that catered to the evolving needs of society.\n\n**Synthesis of Insights**: \nThe panel discussion reveals a nuanced understanding of the religious figures during the New Kingdom.

This marked a significant departure from the traditional polytheistic practices, which had been foundational to Egyptian religion. His establishment of a new capital, Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna), dedicated to Aten, illustrates how religious reforms can influence political and cultural landscapes.\n\n2. **Rise of Amun**: Concurrently, Amun rose to prominence as the supreme state god, particularly in Thebes.

This indicates a shift in religious authority, where Amun's worship became intertwined with the political power of the ruling elite.\n\n3. **Syncretism with Ra**: The syncretism of Amun with Ra, the established patron of kingship, showcases how religious figures can adapt to changing political contexts. This merging of beliefs illustrates the dynamic nature of religious practices and their responsiveness to societal needs.\n\n4. **Importance of Osiris**: The cult of Osiris gained importance during this time, particularly concerning the afterlife and personal morality. This shift from a focus on royal authority to individual ethical considerations reflects broader cultural changes and the evolving nature of Egyptian spirituality.\n\n5. **Influence of Temples and Priesthood**: The expansion of temple resources and the establishment of permanent high-ranking priestly roles indicate a significant shift in religious power dynamics.

While Akhenaten is often highlighted for his introduction of the worship of Aten as the sole deity, the broader context of the New Kingdom reveals that Amun emerged as the most important religious figure during this time.\n\n1. **Amun's Ascendancy**: Amun became the supreme state god during the New Kingdom, particularly after the reunification of Egypt by Theban rulers. His temple at Karnak grew to be the largest religious center in Egypt, and the high priests of Amun gained considerable political power, indicating Amun's central role in both religion and governance.\n\n2. **Syncretism with Ra**: Amun was syncretized with Ra, the sun god, which reflects the evolving religious landscape. This syncretism not only reinforced Amun's importance but also integrated traditional beliefs into the new religious framework, allowing for a continuity of worship while elevating Amun's status.\n\n3. **Decline of Ra's Cult**: Although Ra was historically significant, the passages indicate that his cult was in decline during the New Kingdom, with Amun's influence rising.
