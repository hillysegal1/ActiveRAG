This sequence of events helps to clarify the causal relationships between the need for new facilities and the decisions made by sports organizations.\n\n5. **Logical Inference**:\n   - The information about the transition from the Georgia Dome to Mercedes-Benz Stadium allows for logical inferences about urban development and resource allocation in sports infrastructure. As teams seek modern facilities, it often leads to the construction of new venues and the repurposing of older ones, reflecting a common trend in urban planning.\n\n### Answer:\nThe new football stadium in Atlanta is **Mercedes-Benz Stadium**, located at **1 AMB Drive NW, Atlanta, GA 30313**. This stadium opened in 2017 and serves as the home for both the Atlanta Falcons (NFL) and Atlanta United FC (MLS).
