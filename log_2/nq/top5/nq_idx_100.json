Pervukhin discussed other problems as well, claiming that Ulbricht but also the East German leadership in general, were opposed to the Soviet Union\\'s plan to improve relations with West Germany. When Khrushchev gave his approval to construct what would become the Berlin Wall, Pervukhin was the first to know. Ulbricht told Pervukhin of the need to create the East\u2013West barrier at night, and he and Khrushchev would later agree to this.\\n', 'In 1975 he was sent back to Berlin where he served a second stint as Soviet ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, remaining in post this time till 1983. His years as ambassador were not without Soviet-East German tensions. During the early 1960s the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev was interested in exploring a less confrontational relationship with the west while the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht, remained uncompromisingly hard-line in his attitude to the west in general and in his country\\'s relationship with West Germany specifically. The decision suddenly to erect the Berlin Wall in August 1961 was naturally taken by the East Germans in full consultation with the Soviet ambassador. From the East German perspective The Wall represented a necessary desperate attempt to save the state which appeared to be in the process of losing its entire working age population. With Abrassimov as Soviet ambassador in Berlin, Walter Ulbricht, who had earlier enjoyed close relations with Soviet leader Josef Stalin, found he enjoyed far less direct contact with the Soviet leadership in Moscow. In 1963/64, when Ulbricht moved to control air traffic flying into West Berlin, it was Abrassimov who prevented the move. He actively opposed East German reluctance to conclude a belated post war peace treaty with West Germany, and in 1966 set up direct links with Willy Brandt, then the mayor of West Berlin, without telling the leadership of the East German ruling SED (party). Abrassimov also participated regularly in meetings of the East German cabinet, something which had never happened when Mikhail Pervukhin was the Soviet ambassador. The relationship between the Soviet ambassador and the East German leadership did not improve with the appointment of a new East German leader, Erich Honecker, in 1971. During the 1980s Abrassimov\\'s growing propensity to meet regularly with western ambassadors to Berlin without reference to his East German host government did not help matters. In 1983 he was seen to be becoming ever more paternalistic and autocratic in his ambassadorial office, and following the death of Leonid Brezhnev at the end of 1982, Honecker managed to persuade Moscow to replace Abrassimov because of the extent of his \"interference in East German domestic politics\".\\n', 'Walter Ulbricht (1893\u20131973) was the party boss from 1950 to 1971. In 1933, Ulbricht had fled to Moscow, where he served as a Comintern agent loyal to Stalin. As World War II was ending, Stalin assigned him the job of designing the postwar German system that would centralize all power in the Communist Party. Ulbricht became deputy prime minister in 1949 and secretary (chief executive) of the Socialist Unity (Communist) party in 1950.

The key figure in the Soviet Union during this period was Nikita Khrushchev, who served as the General Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 until 1964.\n\n1. **Nikita Khrushchev's Role**:\n   - Khrushchev's leadership was characterized by significant events in the Cold War, including the construction of the Berlin Wall. His agreement to allow East German leader Walter Ulbricht to construct the Wall indicates his direct involvement in East German affairs and reflects the Soviet Union's influence over its satellite states.\n\n2. **Context of the Berlin Wall**:\n   - The Berlin Wall was erected in response to a crisis in East Germany, where approximately 2.6 million people had fled to West Germany by 1961. The Wall was intended to stop this mass emigration and stabilize the East German state. It was officially referred to by the East German government as the \"Anti-Fascist Protective Wall,\" which highlights the propaganda narrative used to justify its construction.\n\n3. **Walter Ulbricht's Leadership**:\n   - Walter Ulbricht, who was the leader of East Germany from 1950 to 1971, played a crucial role in the decision to build the Wall. His relationship with Khrushchev was significant, as it illustrates the dynamics between local leaders in Eastern Europe and the Soviet leadership. Ulbricht's hardline stance against the West and his reliance on Soviet support were critical in the context of the Wall's construction.\n\n4. **Geopolitical Implications**:\n   - The construction of the Berlin Wall not only served to prevent emigration but also symbolized the division of Europe during the Cold War. Khrushchev's approval of the Wall's construction can be seen as a response to the pressures faced by the Soviet Union and its allies in maintaining control over Eastern Europe.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe enhanced reasoning process confirms that Nikita Khrushchev was the leader of the Soviet Union when the Berlin Wall was built.

The Berlin Wall was constructed on August 13, 1961. The leader of the Soviet Union during this period was Nikita Khrushchev, who held the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 until 1964.\n\n1. **Identification of Key Events**: The construction of the Berlin Wall was a significant event in the context of the Cold War, primarily aimed at stemming the tide of emigration from East Germany to West Germany. This mass emigration was a critical issue for the East German government, led by Walter Ulbricht, who sought Khrushchev's approval for the Wall's construction.\n\n2. **Khrushchev's Decision-Making**: The passages indicate that Khrushchev agreed to the construction of the Wall during a visit to East Germany, highlighting his role in the decision-making process. This illustrates the interplay between Soviet and East German leadership, where Khrushchev's consent was pivotal for Ulbricht's plans.\n\n3. **Contextual Factors**: The decision to build the Wall was influenced by various factors, including the political climate of the time, the desire to maintain stability in East Germany, and the broader geopolitical tensions of the Cold War. Understanding these factors helps clarify why Khrushchev supported the Wall's construction.\n\n4. **Dynamic Leadership Relations**: The relationship between Khrushchev and Ulbricht was complex, with Khrushchev advocating for a less confrontational approach towards the West, while Ulbricht maintained a hardline stance. This dynamic is crucial for understanding the motivations behind the Wall's construction and the implications for Soviet-East German relations.\n\n5. **Temporal Context**: The timeline of events leading up to the Wall's construction, including the mass emigration crisis, provides a clearer picture of the urgency felt by East German leaders. This temporal reasoning allows us to connect the actions taken by Khrushchev and Ulbricht with the broader historical context of the Cold War.\n\nBy synthesizing this information, we can conclude that Nikita Khrushchev was indeed the leader of the Soviet Union when the Berlin Wall was built, and his involvement was instrumental in the decision to erect the Wall as a response to the political and social pressures faced by East Germany.\n\n### Answer:\nNikita Khrushchev"}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwho was the leader of the soviet union when the berlin wall was built\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['BULLET::::- On a visit to East Germany, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev agreed to let DDR leader Walter Ulbricht order construction of the Berlin Wall.\\n', 'Heinz Sokolowski (17 December 1917 \u2013 25 November 1965) was a German man who became the sixty-fourth known person to die at the Berlin Wall. Sokolowski, a former political prisoner, was shot and killed by East German border troops while attempting to cross the Berlin Wall near to the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag building.\\n', 'Walter Ulbricht, the East German leader, invited Pervukhin to his summer house to discuss the East German immigration flow to West Germany. There Ulbricht told Pervukhin that if the Soviets did not react soon, East Germany would \"collapse\". Pervukhin discussed other problems as well, claiming that Ulbricht but also the East German leadership in general, were opposed to the Soviet Union\\'s plan to improve relations with West Germany. When Khrushchev gave his approval to construct what would become the Berlin Wall, Pervukhin was the first to know. Ulbricht told Pervukhin of the need to create the East\u2013West barrier at night, and he and Khrushchev would later agree to this.\\n', 'In 1975 he was sent back to Berlin where he served a second stint as Soviet ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, remaining in post this time till 1983. His years as ambassador were not without Soviet-East German tensions. During the early 1960s the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev was interested in exploring a less confrontational relationship with the west while the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht, remained uncompromisingly hard-line in his attitude to the west in general and in his country\\'s relationship with West Germany specifically. The decision suddenly to erect the Berlin Wall in August 1961 was naturally taken by the East Germans in full consultation with the Soviet ambassador. From the East German perspective The Wall represented a necessary desperate attempt to save the state which appeared to be in the process of losing its entire working age population. With Abrassimov as Soviet ambassador in Berlin, Walter Ulbricht, who had earlier enjoyed close relations with Soviet leader Josef Stalin, found he enjoyed far less direct contact with the Soviet leadership in Moscow. In 1963/64, when Ulbricht moved to control air traffic flying into West Berlin, it was Abrassimov who prevented the move. He actively opposed East German reluctance to conclude a belated post war peace treaty with West Germany, and in 1966 set up direct links with Willy Brandt, then the mayor of West Berlin, without telling the leadership of the East German ruling SED (party). Abrassimov also participated regularly in meetings of the East German cabinet, something which had never happened when Mikhail Pervukhin was the Soviet ambassador. The relationship between the Soviet ambassador and the East German leadership did not improve with the appointment of a new East German leader, Erich Honecker, in 1971. During the 1980s Abrassimov\\'s growing propensity to meet regularly with western ambassadors to Berlin without reference to his East German host government did not help matters. In 1983 he was seen to be becoming ever more paternalistic and autocratic in his ambassadorial office, and following the death of Leonid Brezhnev at the end of 1982, Honecker managed to persuade Moscow to replace Abrassimov because of the extent of his \"interference in East German domestic politics\".\\n', 'Walter Ulbricht (1893\u20131973) was the party boss from 1950 to 1971.
