This revival led to the establishment of a dedicated filming location at Bovingdon Airfield, which has been the primary venue for filming since then. The continuity of this location suggests a stable production environment, which is crucial for maintaining the show's quality and consistency.\n\n2. **Filming Locations**: The primary filming location is the purpose-built studio at Bovingdon Airfield. Additionally, rehearsals are sometimes filmed at the Lee Valley Ice Centre. This dual-location approach indicates flexibility in production, allowing for rehearsals to take place in a different venue while the main show is filmed at Bovingdon.\n\n3. **Causal Relationships**: The revival of the show in 2018 directly influenced the decision to set up a dedicated studio, showcasing how significant events can lead to logistical changes. This understanding helps in recognizing how production decisions are made based on the show's needs and audience engagement.\n\n4. **Logical Inference**: Given that Bovingdon Airfield has been the established filming location since the revival, it is reasonable to infer that this year, the show continues to utilize this venue. The mention of Lee Valley Ice Centre for rehearsals suggests that while the main filming occurs at Bovingdon, there are alternative locations for specific activities, which can be important for planning and resource allocation.\n\n5. **Temporal Reasoning**: The timeline of events, particularly the revival in 2018 and the ongoing use of Bovingdon Airfield, allows us to predict that the show will likely continue to film there unless stated otherwise.
