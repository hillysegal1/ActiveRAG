The 1930s were a time of great change in America, and songs like \"The Glory of Love\" often reflected the sentiments of hope and resilience during the Great Depression. The song's themes of love and longing resonate deeply with listeners, which may explain its continued relevance and the many interpretations it has inspired over the decades.\n\n**Expert 3: Musicologist**\nI would like to add that the song's structure and melody contribute to its lasting appeal.
