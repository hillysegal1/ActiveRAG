His role contributed to the film's emotional depth and provided a male counterpart to Gracie's character. However, in the sequel, the filmmakers chose to focus on Gracie's personal growth and her transition from an FBI agent to a public figure. This shift may have necessitated a narrative that allowed Gracie to navigate her challenges independently, thereby excluding Matthews to emphasize her self-reliance.\n\n2. **Narrative Requirements**: The sequel introduces new characters, such as Regina King's character, which may have required the removal of existing characters to streamline the plot. The screenwriting perspective suggests that the filmmakers aimed to avoid overcrowding the narrative, allowing for a more focused exploration of Gracie's new challenges, including the kidnapping subplot. This decision aligns with common practices in sequels where character dynamics are adjusted to fit new story arcs.\n\n3. **Cultural Context**: The absence of Agent Matthews can also be interpreted through the lens of evolving gender representation in film. The sequel's focus on Gracie's independence and her ability to tackle problems without a male partner reflects a broader cultural shift towards stronger female leads. This move away from traditional romantic tropes may signify an intention to portray female empowerment more prominently, suggesting that Gracie's journey does not rely on male validation.\n\n4. **Audience Reception**: Despite the filmmakers' intentions, audience reception plays a crucial role in understanding the impact of Matthews' absence. Some viewers expressed disappointment, indicating that Matthews' character was a beloved aspect of the first film. This disconnect highlights the potential risks filmmakers face when altering character dynamics that audiences have come to appreciate. The filmmakers may have underestimated the audience's attachment to Matthews and the chemistry he shared with Gracie.\n\n**Conclusion**: \nThe decision to exclude Agent Matthews from \"Miss Congeniality 2\" was likely a multifaceted one, driven by a combination of narrative focus, character evolution, cultural shifts in gender representation, and audience expectations. While the filmmakers aimed to create a story that emphasized Gracie's independence and introduced new dynamics, they may have overlooked the emotional connection that audiences had with Matthews. Ultimately, this decision reflects the delicate balance filmmakers must navigate between creative vision and audience engagement.\n\n**Answer**: \nAgent Matthews was not in \"Miss Congeniality 2\" primarily due to creative decisions made by the filmmakers to focus on Gracie Hart's character development and new storylines. The sequel emphasizes Gracie's independence and introduces new characters, which may have necessitated the exclusion of Matthews.

The filmmakers may have opted to explore new dynamics and relationships rather than continuing the previous romantic arc.\n\n4. **Absence of Specific Information**: The retrieved passages do not provide explicit reasons for Agent Matthews' absence in the sequel.
