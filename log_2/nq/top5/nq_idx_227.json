The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land and possesses several key functions and powers:\n\n1. **Judicial Review**: The Supreme Court has the authority to review laws and executive actions to determine their constitutionality. This power allows it to invalidate laws or acts that violate the Constitution, serving as a critical check on legislative and executive authority.\n\n2. **Appellate Jurisdiction**: The Supreme Court hears appeals from lower courts, including the Court of Appeals and Regional Trial Courts. It can review, uphold, reverse, or modify decisions made by these courts, thus ensuring uniformity and consistency in the application of law.\n\n3. **Original Jurisdiction**: The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over specific cases, such as those involving ambassadors, public ministers, and consuls, as well as cases where the Philippines is a party. This grants it the authority to hear certain cases directly without them first going through lower courts.\n\n4. **Administrative Supervision**: The Supreme Court exercises administrative authority over all courts and personnel in the judiciary. This includes the power to discipline judges and court personnel, ensuring accountability and integrity within the judicial system.\n\n5. **Rule-Making Power**: The Supreme Court has the power to promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, as well as rules governing pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts. This enables it to shape the legal framework within which the judiciary operates.\n\n6. **Judicial Power**: The Supreme Court exercises judicial power, which includes the authority to settle actual controversies involving rights that are legally demandable and enforceable.
