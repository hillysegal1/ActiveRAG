However, the retrieved authoritative passages provide more precise information regarding the filming locations.\n\n1. **Filming Locations**: The passages confirm that \"Thomas and the Magic Railroad\" was specifically filmed in **Harrisburg and Strasburg, Pennsylvania**.

However, later that year, after London left the company, Paramount shelved the plans for the film. This left Allcroft to seek other sources of funding.
