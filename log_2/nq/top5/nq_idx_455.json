They did not have a dedicated drummer as a permanent member; instead, they collaborated with session musicians for drumming. Notably, Jim Keltner played drums on some of their tracks, contributing to their distinctive sound. The band originated from informal discussions between Harrison and Lynne during the sessions for Harrison's album \"Cloud Nine,\" leading to the recording of their first song, \"Handle with Care.\" The dynamics of collaboration among the members, along with external events such as Orbison's death, influenced their musical output and the release of subsequent albums.\n\n### Answer:\nThe Traveling Wilburys did not have a dedicated drummer, but Jim Keltner played drums on some of their tracks."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwho was the drummer with the travelling wilburys\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The Traveling Wilburys (sometimes shortened to the Wilburys) were an English\u2013American supergroup consisting of Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison and Tom Petty.
