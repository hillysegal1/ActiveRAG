The Council aimed to modernize the Church and make the liturgy more accessible to the laity, which was a response to the changing cultural and social contexts of the time.\n\n1. **Historical Context**: Latin was the traditional language of the Mass for centuries, and its use was deeply rooted in the Church's liturgical practices. The shift away from Latin began around 1964, marking a pivotal moment in the Church's history.\n\n2. **Vatican II Directives**: The directives from Vatican II, particularly the document \"Sacrosanctum Concilium,\" encouraged the use of local languages in the liturgy. This was a deliberate effort to engage the congregation more fully and make the Mass more relatable to the everyday lives of the faithful.\n\n3. **Gradual Implementation**: The transition was not instantaneous but rather a gradual process. Following the Council, bishops' conferences around the world voted to expand the use of vernacular languages, indicating a collective movement towards this change. This gradual approach allowed for adaptation and acceptance within various communities.\n\n4. **Revised Missal Publication**: The publication of the revised Missal in 1970 marked a formal end to the obligation of using Latin in the Mass. This document provided the framework for celebrating Mass entirely in the vernacular, solidifying the changes initiated by Vatican II.\n\n5. **Current Practices**: Today, while the majority of Masses are celebrated in vernacular languages, Latin is still permitted and used occasionally. This reflects a balance between tradition and modernity, allowing for flexibility in liturgical practices.\n\n6. **Regulatory Framework**: The established rules allow for Mass to be celebrated in either Latin or another language, provided the texts are approved. This regulatory aspect highlights the Church's ability to adapt while maintaining its historical roots.\n\n7. **Causal Relationships**: The transition can be understood as a causal relationship where the Vatican II directives acted as a catalyst for broader societal changes within the Church. This understanding helps to illustrate how specific events can lead to significant shifts in cultural practices.\n\n8. **Temporal Relationships**: The timeline of events, from the Vatican II directives in 1964 to the revised Missal in 1970, provides a clear framework for understanding the sequence of changes and their implications over time.\n\n9. **Complexity of Change**: The multifaceted nature of this transition, involving various stakeholders (bishops, congregations, and ecclesiastical authorities), enhances the model's ability to reason about complex social dynamics and the interplay of tradition and innovation.\n\nBy integrating these insights, the model can improve its ability to reason about historical changes, understand causal relationships, and analyze the implications of regulatory frameworks in social contexts.\n\n### Answer:\nThe transition from Latin to vernacular languages in the Roman Catholic Mass began after the Second Vatican Council, which concluded in 1965, with significant changes occurring in the late 1960s. The revised Missal published in 1970 formally ended the obligation to use Latin, allowing for Mass to be celebrated entirely in local languages, although Latin is still permitted in some contexts today."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhen did they stop saying mass in latin\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n[\"Mass was said in Latin until around 1964, when Vatican II's directives came into effect. \\n\", 'Historically speaking, \"Latin Mass\" can be applied also to the various forms of Pre-Tridentine Mass from about the year 190 of Pope Victor, when the Church in Rome changed from Greek to Latin.\\n', 'Latin Mass\\n', 'Bishops\\' Conferences from all over the world soon voted to expand the use of the vernacular, and requested confirmation of this choice from Rome.
