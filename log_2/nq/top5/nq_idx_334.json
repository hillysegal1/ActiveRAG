This case involved a Louisiana law that granted a monopoly to a specific slaughterhouse in New Orleans, which directly affected local butchers. \n\nWhile the language model correctly identifies that the butchers involved in these cases were primarily located in New Orleans, it is important to enhance this understanding with additional context regarding the demographics and living conditions of these workers. \n\n1. **Demographics of Slaughterhouse Workers**: The original slaughterhouse workers were largely recent immigrants from Irish, German, and Scandinavian backgrounds. This demographic detail is crucial for understanding the labor force in the slaughterhouses during that period.\n\n2. **Living Conditions**: Most workers lived in slums adjacent to the slaughterhouses, which underscores the socio-economic challenges they faced. This aspect of their living conditions is essential for a comprehensive understanding of their circumstances.\n\n3. **Specific Locations**: While the passages mention specific individuals and their movements to places like Greeley, Colorado, and St. Charles, Illinois, these details are less relevant to the general population of butchers in the context of the slaughterhouse cases. However, they do provide insight into the mobility of individuals within the profession.\n\nBy integrating this additional information, the model can better appreciate the socio-economic context and the demographic background of the butchers involved in the slaughterhouse cases, which helps prevent potential oversights or inaccuracies regarding their living situations.\n\n**Answer:** The butchers in the slaughterhouse cases primarily lived in New Orleans, Louisiana.
