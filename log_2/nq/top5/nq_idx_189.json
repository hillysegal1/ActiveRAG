The journey from the Dust Bowl to California symbolizes hope and despair, which are central themes in Steinbeck's work.\n\n**Expert 2: Historical Context Specialist**\nI agree with the literary scholar regarding the setting in Oklahoma and California. However, it's important to emphasize the historical context. The Dust Bowl, which devastated the Great Plains in the 1930s, forced many families to leave their homes. This migration is not just a backdrop; it represents a significant moment in American history where economic hardship led to mass displacement. The novel captures the essence of this period and the struggles faced by migrant workers in California, who were often met with hostility and exploitation.\n\n**Expert 3: Adaptation and Cultural Impact Analyst**\nWhile I appreciate the focus on the novel's setting, I would like to highlight the various adaptations of \"The Grapes of Wrath,\" including the opera and the play.
