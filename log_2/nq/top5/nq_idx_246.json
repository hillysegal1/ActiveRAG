This period saw the repeal of Poynings' Law, which had restricted Irish legislative autonomy since 1495. However, this limited independence was curtailed by the Act of Union in 1801, which dissolved the Irish Parliament and brought Ireland under direct British rule.\n\n2. **The Act of Union (1801)**:\n   - The Act of Union was a significant turning point, marking the end of any semblance of legislative independence for Ireland. It united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland into a single entity, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which further fueled nationalist sentiments and the desire for self-governance.\n\n3. **Emergence of Nationalist Movements**:\n   - The early 20th century saw a resurgence of nationalist movements, culminating in the Easter Rising of 1916. This rebellion, although initially unsuccessful, galvanized public support for independence and led to increased political activism.\n\n4. **The Anglo-Irish War (1919-1921)**:\n   - Following the Easter Rising, the Irish War of Independence erupted, leading to a conflict between Irish republicans and British forces. This war was pivotal in establishing the legitimacy of the Irish independence movement and ultimately resulted in negotiations for a treaty.\n\n5. **The Anglo-Irish Treaty (1921)**:\n   - The Anglo-Irish Treaty, signed in December 1921, was a landmark agreement that recognized Ireland as a self-governing dominion within the British Empire. This treaty laid the groundwork for the establishment of the Irish Free State.\n\n6. **Establishment of the Irish Free State (1922)**:\n   - The Irish Free State officially came into existence on December 6, 1922, marking a formal end to British rule in most of Ireland. However, it is important to note that Northern Ireland opted to remain part of the United Kingdom, leading to ongoing divisions.\n\n7. **Further Developments**:\n   - The Irish Free State was initially a dominion, but subsequent developments, including the adoption of a new constitution in 1937, further solidified its sovereignty. The Statute of Westminster in 1931 allowed the Irish parliament to make laws without British interference, marking a significant step towards full independence.\n\n8. **Strained Relations with Britain**:\n   - Even after independence, relations between Ireland and Britain remained tense, exemplified by events such as the Anglo-Irish Trade War. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for grasping the broader historical narrative of Ireland's independence and its implications for Anglo-Irish relations.\n\n### Answer:\nIreland gained its independence from England on December 6, 1922, with the establishment of the Irish Free State, following the Anglo-Irish Treaty signed in December 1921. This marked the formal end of British rule in most of Ireland, although Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom.

However, this was curtailed by the Act of Union in 1801, which united Ireland with Great Britain due to British fears of rebellion during the French Revolutionary Wars. This illustrates how external threats can lead to significant legislative changes, establishing a causal relationship between geopolitical factors and domestic governance.\n\n2. **Early 20th Century Movements**:\n   - The early 20th century saw a resurgence of nationalist sentiment, culminating in the Easter Rising of 1916. This rebellion, although initially suppressed, galvanized public support for independence and led to increased political activism. The causal link here is that the failure of the uprising created a martyrdom effect, which intensified the push for independence.\n\n3. **Anglo-Irish War and Treaty**:\n   - The Irish War of Independence (1919-1921) was a direct response to the desire for self-governance, resulting in the Anglo-Irish Treaty signed in December 1921. This treaty established the Irish Free State, marking a significant political transformation. The Treaty was not just a product of the war but also reflected the changing dynamics of British-Irish relations and the internal pressures for self-determination.\n\n4. **Formal Independence**:\n   - The Irish Free State officially came into existence on December 6, 1922. However, it was still a dominion within the British Empire, indicating that while formal independence was achieved, full sovereignty was a gradual process. This highlights the complexity of independence movements, where initial steps can lead to further negotiations and legislative changes.\n\n5. **Subsequent Developments**:\n   - Full legislative independence was not realized until the adoption of a new constitution in 1937 and the Statute of Westminster, which clarified Ireland's status. This progression from dominion status to full independence illustrates a causal chain where initial independence led to further reforms and the eventual establishment of a fully sovereign state.\n\n6. **Northern Ireland's Status**:\n   - It is crucial to note that Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom, which underscores the complexities of national identity and territorial governance in the context of independence movements. This aspect adds depth to the understanding of how independence can be uneven and contested.\n\n### Answer:\nIreland gained its independence from England on December 6, 1922, with the establishment of the Irish Free State, following a series of significant events including the Easter Rising in 1916 and the Anglo-Irish War from 1919 to 1921. While this marked the formal end of British rule in most of Ireland, it is important to recognize that Northern Ireland continued to remain part of the United Kingdom.
