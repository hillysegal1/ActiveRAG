This included a strong opposition to tightly-fitting corsets, high-heeled shoes, and heavy skirts. Understanding this purpose allows us to see the Society not just as a fashion movement but as part of a broader health and wellness initiative.\n\n3. **Influence on Fashion Norms**: By the late 19th century, the Rational Dress Society began to influence women's dress, indicating that their advocacy was gaining traction despite prevailing fashion norms. This suggests a causal relationship where the Society's efforts contributed to gradual changes in societal attitudes toward women's clothing.\n\n4. **Significant Events as Catalysts**: The notable event in **1889**, where Charlotte Carmichael Stopes presented on rational dress at a major scientific meeting, illustrates how specific actions can catalyze broader societal discussions. This event not only raised awareness but also positioned the Society within the larger discourse of women's rights and health, demonstrating the interconnectedness of social movements.\n\n5. **Interconnectedness of Social Issues**: The Society's work is linked to the broader women's rights movement, indicating that changes in dress norms were part of a larger struggle for women's autonomy and health. Recognizing these connections enhances the model's ability to infer relationships between different social issues and movements.\n\n6. **Long-term Effects**: The Society's influence on women's dress and its advocacy for health and comfort can be seen as a precursor to modern discussions about body positivity and functional fashion. This understanding allows the model to predict how historical movements can shape contemporary social issues.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy integrating this enhanced reasoning process, the model can better understand the causal relationships and motivations behind the Rational Dress Society's formation and actions. This understanding will improve its ability to analyze and predict the outcomes of similar social movements based on historical contexts.\n\n### Answer:\nThe Rational Dress Society began to work in **1881**, emerging in response to the restrictive clothing styles of the time, advocating for practical and comfortable clothing as part of a broader movement for women's health and rights."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhen did the rational dress society begin to work\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The Rational Dress Society was an organisation founded in 1881 in London.
