The term \"ice age\" refers to a period in Earth's history when significant portions of the planet were covered by ice sheets and glaciers. \n2. The first major ice age is known as the Huronian glaciation, which occurred approximately 2.4 billion years ago during the Proterozoic Eon.\n3. However, the most commonly referenced ice ages in geological history are the Pleistocene ice ages, which began around 2.58 million years ago and lasted until about 11,700 years ago.\n4. The Pleistocene epoch is characterized by repeated glacial cycles, where glaciers expanded and retreated multiple times.\n5. Therefore, when asking about the \"first ice age,\" it is important to clarify whether we are discussing the earliest known glaciation events or the more recent and well-studied Pleistocene ice ages.\n\nAnswer:\nThe first major ice age, known as the Huronian glaciation, occurred approximately 2.4 billion years ago.

The term \"ice age\" can refer to both geological periods characterized by extensive glaciation and popular media, such as films and video games.\n2. In geological terms, the first major ice age is known as the Huronian glaciation, which occurred approximately 2.4 billion years ago during the Proterozoic Eon.\n3. The most commonly referenced ice ages in geological history are the Pleistocene ice ages, which began around 2.58 million years ago and lasted until about 11,700 years ago. This epoch is marked by repeated glacial cycles.\n4. However, the question may also refer to the \"Ice Age\" franchise, which includes animated films and video games. The first film in this franchise, titled \"Ice Age,\" was released in **2002**.\n5. Additionally, there is a **1975 German film** titled \"Ice Age,\" which is unrelated to the animated franchise and may cause confusion if not clarified.\n6. Therefore, it is essential to distinguish between the geological concept of ice ages and the popular media references when answering the question.\n\n### Answer:\nThe first major ice age, known as the Huronian glaciation, occurred approximately 2.4 billion years ago. The most recognized ice ages, the Pleistocene ice ages, began around 2.58 million years ago. However, if you are referring to the \"Ice Age\" franchise, the first animated film titled \"Ice Age\" was released in **2002**.
