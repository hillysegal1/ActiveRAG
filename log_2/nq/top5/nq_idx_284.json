This conclusion marked the introduction of the nuclear model of the atom, which is often credited to Rutherford.\n\nHowever, it is important to recognize that the concept of a nuclear model was not entirely new at the time. Hantaro Nagaoka had proposed an early version of a nuclear model in 1904, where electrons orbit a dense nucleus, akin to a miniature solar system. This earlier model laid the groundwork for Rutherford's later work, indicating that the development of atomic theory involved contributions from multiple scientists.\n\nFurthermore, the understanding of atomic structure continued to evolve with the introduction of the nuclear shell model in 1932 by Dmitry Ivanenko, which described the nucleus in terms of energy levels and was further developed by physicists such as Eugene Wigner, Maria Goeppert Mayer, and J.

This model provided a more complex understanding of the atomic nucleus and its behavior.\n\nTo prevent oversimplification and ensure accuracy in the historical context of atomic theory, it is essential to acknowledge the contributions of both Nagaoka and Rutherford, as well as the subsequent developments in nuclear physics.
