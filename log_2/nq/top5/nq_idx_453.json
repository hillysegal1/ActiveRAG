This expansion, coupled with the NCAA's strategic growth\u2014from 25 teams in 1975 to 68 in 2011\u2014enhanced fan engagement and media coverage, making the NCAA Tournament increasingly significant.\n\nMoreover, the NCAA's effective marketing strategies, particularly the branding of \"March Madness,\" played a crucial role in elevating the tournament's status. The integration of the NCAA Tournament into American culture as a major sporting event further solidified its dominance over the NIT, which remained relatively static and could not compete with the NCAA's growing reach.\n\nIn summary, the NCAA Tournament's rise over the NIT is attributed to a combination of historical events, strategic governance, cultural shifts, and marketing prowess. By the 1970s, the NCAA Tournament had clearly surpassed the NIT in terms of media coverage, fan engagement, and overall significance in college basketball. The consensus among experts suggests that while the NIT held a superior status initially, the NCAA's strategic maneuvers and cultural integration led to its eventual dominance.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe NCAA Tournament became more important than the NIT in the 1970s, following a series of historical events, including the impact of the 1951 gambling scandals, strategic governance decisions, cultural shifts in college basketball, and effective marketing strategies that elevated the NCAA Tournament's status to that of the premier postseason event in college basketball."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nwhen did the ncaa tournament became more important than the nit\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['During the early years of the two tournaments, the NCAA and NIT competed against each other, giving rise to debate over their relative prowess.

Through the 1960s and 1970s, with UCLA leading the way as winner of ten NCAA Tournament championships, a shift in power to teams from the west amplified the shift of attention away from the New York City-based NIT. When the NCAA tournament expanded its field of teams from 25 to 32 in 1975, to 48 in 1980, to 64 in 1985, and to 68 teams in 2011, interest in the NCAA tournament increased again and again, as it comprised more and more teams, soon including all of the strongest ones. (Expansion also improved the distribution of playing locations, which number roughly one-third the number of teams in the field.)\n", "BULLET::::- During 1939, Long Island University finished the regular season unbeaten but decided to accept instead an invitation to the second NIT (which they won) instead of the first and only NABC tournament (later called the NCAA tournament), as the NIT was more prestigious at the time. It wasn't until the mid-1950s that the NCAA required that its tournament would have \"first choice\" in determining teams for their field. Before then, many of the more successful teams during the regular season chose to play in the NIT instead of the NCAA tournament.\n", "After the fall-out from the 1951 gambling and point-shaving scandals, the NCAA tournament pulled out of Madison Square Garden. With conference champions and the majority of the top-ranked teams participating in it, the NCAA tournament since then came to be regarded as the more important post-season tourney and the sole determiner of the national championship, although following the taint of the gambling scandals, the NIT was still considered a quality tournament for some time afterward. The NCAA built on the momentum of three consecutive Red Cross \"mythical national championship\" game victories over the NIT, eventually outmaneuvering the NIT by adeptly avoiding permanent damage from the 1951 gambling and point-shaving scandals and by adding more teams. As the NCAA Tournament steadily gained preeminence and became the sole source of naming the national champion, winners of the NCAA Tournament during those early years were given the same level of honor.\n", "The National Commissioners Invitational Tournament was an eight-team postseason college men's basketball tournament run by the NCAA. It was introduced in 1974 as the Collegiate Commissioners Association Tournament. It was created because the NCAA wanted to \"kill\" the NIT, which, at that time, it did not control. It only lasted two years before being discontinued after changes to the NCAA Tournament which allowed more than one team per conference to participate.\n"], "__answers__": ["By the mid-1980s"]}}
