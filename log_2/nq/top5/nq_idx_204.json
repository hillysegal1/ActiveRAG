The action potential generated by the SA node passes down the electrical conduction system of the heart, and depolarizes the other potential pacemaker cells (AV node) to initiate action potentials before these other cells have had a chance to generate their own spontaneous action potential, thus they contract and propagate electrical impulses to the pace set by the cells of the SA node. This is the normal conduction of electrical activity in the heart.\\n', 'The pattern of prepotential or spontaneous depolarization, followed by rapid depolarization and repolarization just described, are seen in the SA node and a few other conductive cells in the heart. Since the SA node is the pacemaker, it reaches threshold faster than any other component of the conduction system. It will initiate the impulses spreading to the other conducting cells. The SA node, without nervous or endocrine control, would initiate a heart impulse approximately 80\u2013100 times per minute. Although each component of the conduction system is capable of generating its own impulse, the rate progressively slows from the SA node to the Purkinje fibers. Without the SA node, the AV node would generate a heart rate of 40\u201360 beats per minute. If the AV node were blocked, the atrioventricular bundle would fire at a rate of approximately 30\u201340 impulses per minute. The bundle branches would have an inherent rate of 20\u201330 impulses per minute, and the Purkinje fibers would fire at 15\u201320 impulses per minute. While a few exceptionally trained aerobic athletes demonstrate resting heart rates in the range of 30\u201340 beats per minute (the lowest recorded figure is 28 beats per minute for Miguel Indurain, a cyclist)\u2013for most individuals, rates lower than 50 beats per minute would indicate a condition called bradycardia. Depending upon the specific individual, as rates fall much below this level, the heart would be unable to maintain adequate flow of blood to vital tissues, initially resulting in decreasing loss of function across the systems, unconsciousness, and ultimately death.\\n', 'In a first degree sinoatrial block, there is a lag between the time that the SA node fires and actual depolarization of the atria. This rhythm is not recognizable on an ECG strip because a strip does not denote when the SA node fires. It can be detected only during an electrophysiology study when a small wire is placed against the SA node from within the heart and the electrical impulses can be recorded as they leave the p-cells in the centre of the node [ see pacemaker potential ], followed by observing a delay in the onset of the p wave on the ECG.\\n', 'In a healthy heart, specialized cells in the sinoatrial node are responsible for the generation of contractile stimuli that are directed throughout the heart. A direct neural-like pathway propagates this electrical signal from the SA node through the atrial tissue to a central nodal point in the center of the heart, the atrioventricular node.
