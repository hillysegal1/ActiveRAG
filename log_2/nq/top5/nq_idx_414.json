The belief in Greek gods is rooted in ancient Greek religion, which was polytheistic, meaning it involved the worship of multiple deities. \n\nThe term that encompasses the belief in these gods and the associated practices is often referred to as \"Hellenism.\" However, it is important to note that there are modern movements that actively practice and promote the worship of Greek gods, which are referred to as Hellenic Polytheism or Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism (Hellenismos).
