This timeline is crucial as it highlights the planning and execution phases involved in such a significant institutional change.\n\n1. **Historical Context**: The move was largely influenced by political figures like Cledwyn Hughes, who sought to elevate the status of the Welsh Office and promote economic development in Wales. This reflects broader socio-political changes in the UK during the 1960s, where there was a growing recognition of regional identities and the need for equitable investment across the country.\n\n2. **Economic Implications**: The establishment of the Royal Mint in Llantrisant was not merely a relocation but a strategic investment in a region that had been economically disadvantaged. This move likely contributed to job creation and local economic growth, making it a significant factor in the revitalization of the area.\n\n3. **Operational Modernization**: The transition also allowed the Royal Mint to modernize its facilities and adopt advanced minting technologies. This operational efficiency was essential for meeting the increasing demand for coin production, which had evolved significantly since the Mint's original establishment in London.\n\n4. **Cultural Significance**: The relocation can be viewed as a recognition of Welsh identity and autonomy, particularly during a time when discussions around devolution were gaining momentum.

Initially, it operated in London since 886 and moved to a site at East Smithfield in 1809. The decision to relocate to Wales was made in 1967, influenced by political efforts to establish the Royal Mint in Llantrisant rather than in Scotland or Durham. This decision was part of a broader effort to enhance the stature of the Welsh Office.\n\nThe actual transfer of operations to Llantrisant was a gradual process, culminating in the closure of the London Mint in November 1975. By that time, the Royal Mint had fully transitioned its production to the new facility in Wales. Today, the Royal Mint operates solely from Llantrisant, which is significant for understanding its current operational status.\n\nIn summary, the Royal Mint's move to Wales was finalized in 1975 after a decision made in 1967, and it is now the only facility of the Royal Mint.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe Royal Mint moved to Wales in November 1975, following a decision made in 1967 to establish its operations in Llantrisant."}], "question_info": {"question": "when did the royal mint move to wales", "passages": ["He spent much of his time developing the nascent Welsh Office, creating a new civil service structure in Wales and seeking to build the economic base.
