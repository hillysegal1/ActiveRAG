Here\u2019s a breakdown of the pertinent content:\n\n### Extracted Information:\n\n1. **Historical Context**:\n   - Jelly beans were first mentioned in 1861 when Boston confectioner William Schrafft encouraged sending them to soldiers during the American Civil War.\n   - They were later mentioned in the \"Chicago Daily News\" in 1905, indicating their growing popularity.\n\n2. **Association with Easter**:\n   - Most historians agree that jelly beans became associated with Easter celebrations in the United States during the 1930s due to their egg-like shape.\n   - The invention of plastic Easter eggs facilitated the inclusion of jelly beans as treats inside these eggs.\n\n3. **Cultural Practices**:\n   - The tradition of Easter eggs has historical roots in Christianity, symbolizing rebirth, and became popular in medieval Europe. This context provides a backdrop for why egg-shaped candies like jelly beans would be fitting for Easter celebrations.\n\n### Analysis of Impact on Causal Reasoning and Logical Inference:\n\n1. **Understanding Causality**:\n   - The model can learn to identify causal relationships, such as how the shape of jelly beans (egg-like) led to their association with Easter celebrations. This teaches the model to recognize that physical attributes can influence cultural practices.\n\n2. **Temporal Relationships**:\n   - The timeline of events (from the first mention of jelly beans in 1861 to their association with Easter in the 1930s) helps the model understand how cultural associations can evolve over time.
