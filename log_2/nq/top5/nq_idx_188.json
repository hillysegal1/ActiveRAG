Before that, popcorn was commonly sold at fairs and carnivals. The Great Depression played a significant role in popularizing popcorn in cinemas, as it was an inexpensive snack that could be easily made and sold. The first known instance of popcorn being sold in a movie theater was in the 1930s. The introduction of popcorn machines made it easier to prepare and serve popcorn in theaters.

The popularization of popcorn in cinemas can be traced back to the early 20th century, particularly during the Great Depression, when it became an inexpensive and easily prepared snack. The introduction of popcorn machines facilitated its sale in theaters, making it a convenient option for moviegoers.\n\nWhile the language model previously suggested that no single individual could be credited with the introduction of popcorn at the movies, the retrieved passages provide specific insights into key figures involved in this transition. Samuel M. Rubin, known as \"Sam the Popcorn Man,\" is credited with the mass introduction of popcorn machines to cinemas in the 1930s. However, there is uncertainty surrounding his role, as his daughter and a former partner indicate that he may not have sold popcorn in significant quantities until the 1950s. This suggests that while Rubin played a significant role in popularizing popcorn in theaters, he may not have been the original pioneer in selling it.\n\nAdditionally, Charles Cretors invented the first popcorn machine in 1885, predating Rubin's activities. This invention laid the groundwork for the eventual sale of popcorn in theaters, indicating that the introduction of popcorn to cinemas was influenced by earlier technological advancements.\n\nIn summary, the model's knowledge should be updated to reflect the following points:\n- Samuel M. Rubin is recognized for popularizing popcorn in theaters but may not have been the first to sell it in significant quantities.\n- Charles Cretors invented the first popcorn machine in 1885, which was crucial for the later sale of popcorn in theaters.\n- There is ambiguity regarding the timeline of when popcorn was first sold in theaters, suggesting that the model should consider multiple contributors to the practice.\n\n**Answer:**\nPopcorn became popular in movie theaters in the 1930s, influenced by the Great Depression and the availability of popcorn machines. Samuel M. Rubin, known as \"Sam the Popcorn Man,\" played a significant role in popularizing popcorn in cinemas, although he may not have been the first to sell it in large quantities.
