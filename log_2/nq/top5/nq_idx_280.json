This was a time when societal norms were shifting, and there was a push for greater personal freedoms.\n\n2. **Concerns About Public Safety**:\n   - The increase in drunk driving incidents and alcohol-related accidents among young people during this period raised significant public health concerns. Advocacy groups and lawmakers began to recognize the need for stricter regulations to protect public safety.\n\n3. **Legislative Action**:\n   - In response to these concerns, the U.S. Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act in 1984. This act mandated that all states raise their minimum legal drinking age to 21 by October 1986. States that failed to comply would face a reduction in federal highway funds, creating a strong incentive for compliance.\n\n4. **Implementation and Compliance**:\n   - By mid-1988, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had complied with the federal mandate, with South Dakota and Wyoming being the last states to raise their drinking ages. This illustrates the gradual process of implementation and the federal government's role in standardizing the drinking age across the nation.\n\n5. **Ongoing Debate**:\n   - Despite the establishment of the legal drinking age at 21, the issue remains contentious. Some states have proposed legislation to lower the drinking age, and there are ongoing discussions about the implications of this law in relation to the age of majority (18 in most states). This reflects a broader societal debate about youth rights, public health, and the effectiveness of the drinking age in preventing alcohol-related harm.\n\n6. **Cultural and International Context**:\n   - The drinking age of 21 in the U.S. is higher than in many other countries, where the legal drinking age is often 18 or 19. This difference raises questions about cultural attitudes towards alcohol and the effectiveness of age restrictions in various contexts.\n\n### Answer:\nThe legal drinking age in the United States was changed to 21 with the passage of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act in 1984. This federal legislation mandated that all states raise their minimum legal drinking age to 21 by October 1986, with compliance achieved by mid-1988. The change was largely driven by concerns over drunk driving and alcohol-related accidents among young people, and it remains a topic of debate in contemporary society."}], "associate": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are part of a panel of experts engaged in a collaborative discussion to address the following question:\nwhen did the legal drinking age changed to 21\n\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['In response to the National Minimum Drinking Age Act in 1984, which reduced by up to 10% the federal highway funding of any state which did not have a minimum purchasing age of 21, the New York Legislature raised the drinking age from 19 to 21, effective December 1, 1985.

The historical context is crucial here; prior to this act, many states had varying ages, with some as low as 18. The act was a significant federal intervention aimed at reducing drunk driving fatalities, which had become a pressing public safety issue.\n\n**Expert 2: Legislative Analyst**\nI agree with Expert 1 on the importance of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act. However, it\u2019s essential to note that the movement towards raising the drinking age began earlier, with several states voluntarily increasing their ages to 19 during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The 1983 Wisconsin Act 74, for example, established a drinking age of 19 before the 1985 legislation raised it to 21. This indicates a gradual shift in public policy rather than a sudden change.\n\n**Expert 3: Sociocultural Perspective**\nWhile the legislative history is important, we must also consider the sociocultural implications of raising the drinking age. The decision to set the minimum age at 21 has been contentious, as it is higher than the age of majority in most states. This discrepancy raises questions about the rights of young adults and the effectiveness of such laws in curbing alcohol consumption among youth.

The fact that all states complied by 1988 underscores the law's perceived importance.\n\n**Expert 5: Legal Scholar**\nFrom a legal perspective, the National Minimum Drinking Age Act can be seen as a controversial exercise of federal power.

Initially, many states set the drinking age at 18 during the 1970s. However, rising concerns about drunk driving and alcohol-related accidents, particularly among young people, prompted a reevaluation of these laws.\n\n2. **Legislative Action**: In 1984, the U.S. Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which mandated that all states raise their minimum purchasing age for alcohol to 21. This legislation was a response to the alarming rates of alcohol-related fatalities and aimed to create a uniform standard across the country.\n\n3. **Incentives for Compliance**: The act included a significant incentive for states to comply: those that did not raise their drinking age would face a reduction in federal highway funds. This financial pressure effectively encouraged all states to adopt the new law.\n\n4. **Gradual Shift**: Prior to the federal mandate, some states had already begun to raise their drinking ages voluntarily, with several states moving to a minimum age of 19 in the early 1980s. This indicates that the push for a higher drinking age was part of a broader trend rather than an abrupt change.\n\n5. **Public Health Perspective**: The decision to raise the drinking age was not solely a legislative maneuver; it was also rooted in public health concerns. Research has shown that raising the drinking age has contributed to a decrease in alcohol-related traffic fatalities among young people, highlighting the law's intended protective benefits.\n\n6. **Sociocultural Implications**: The decision to set the drinking age at 21 has been contentious. Critics argue that this age is higher than the age of majority in most states, raising questions about the rights of young adults. Additionally, the U.S. drinking age is higher than in many other countries, leading to debates about its effectiveness and alignment with societal norms.\n\n7. **Legal Considerations**: The National Minimum Drinking Age Act has also sparked discussions about federalism and states' rights.

However, during the 1970s, many states lowered their drinking age to 18, reflecting changing social attitudes towards alcohol consumption and youth rights.\n\n2. **Social Issues and Legislative Response**:\n   - By the late 1970s and early 1980s, rising concerns about drunk driving and alcohol-related accidents, particularly among young people, prompted a national dialogue about the dangers of underage drinking. This led to increased advocacy for raising the drinking age back to 21.\n\n3. **National Minimum Drinking Age Act (1984)**:\n   - In response to these concerns, the U.S. Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act in 1984. This act mandated that all states raise their minimum legal drinking age to 21 by October 1986. States that did not comply would face a reduction in federal highway funds, creating a strong financial incentive for compliance.\n\n4. **State Compliance and Implementation**:\n   - Following the act, states began to enact laws to comply. For example, New York raised its drinking age from 19 to 21, effective December 1, 1985, and Wisconsin followed suit on September 1, 1986. By mid-1988, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had complied with the federal mandate, with South Dakota and Wyoming being the last to do so.\n\n5. **Ongoing Debate**:\n   - The legal drinking age of 21 remains a contentious issue, with ongoing debates about its effectiveness and fairness, especially considering that the age of majority in most states is 18. This highlights the dynamic nature of laws and societal norms, as well as the potential for future changes based on public opinion and legislative action.\n\n### Answer:\nThe legal drinking age in the United States changed to 21 with the passage of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act in 1984, which mandated that all states raise their minimum drinking age to 21 by October 1986.

(The drinking age had been 18 for many years before the first raise on December 4, 1982, to 19.) Persons under 21 are prohibited from purchasing alcohol or possessing alcohol with the intent to consume, unless the alcohol was given to that person by their parent or legal guardian.
