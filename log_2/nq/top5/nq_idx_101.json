The character has a complex narrative that revolves around her interactions with her husband, Eric Forrester, and her rivalries with other characters, particularly Brooke Logan. \n\nThe expert panel discussion highlights several key points:\n\n1. **Lack of Emphasis on Maternal Figure**: The soap opera historian notes that Stephanie's mother is not a prominent character in the series. This suggests that the show prioritizes immediate family dynamics over extended family backgrounds, which is common in soap operas.\n\n2. **Character Dynamics**: The character analysis specialist emphasizes that while Stephanie's mother is not explicitly mentioned, understanding Stephanie's relationships with her children and husband can provide insight into her character. The absence of her mother may symbolize a focus on her self-constructed identity rather than one inherited from her maternal lineage.\n\n3. **Cultural Representation**: The cultural context expert points out that Stephanie embodies the strong matriarch archetype, which is prevalent in soap operas. This absence of a maternal figure could reflect societal views on female strength and independence, suggesting that Stephanie's identity is shaped by her experiences rather than her family background.\n\n4. **Media Themes**: The media studies scholar adds that contrasting Stephanie's character with other maternal figures in the show can deepen our understanding of motherhood's portrayal.
