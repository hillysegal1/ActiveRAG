As of my last update in October 2023, I need to verify the latest information regarding the representative for that district.\n\nFrom the retrieved knowledge, it is clear that the provided passages do not specify the current representative of Arizona's 9th congressional district. However, based on my existing knowledge, I recall that Greg Stanton, a Democrat, has been serving as the representative for this district since its creation in 2013. He has been re-elected in subsequent election cycles.\n\nTo enhance the reasoning process, I will incorporate the following points:\n\n1. **Current Representative**: Greg Stanton is the current representative for Arizona's 9th congressional district, having served since the district's establishment.\n  \n2. **Election Context**: It is important to note that he has successfully won re-election in the most recent election cycle, affirming his ongoing representation of the district.\n\nBy integrating this information, I can provide a more accurate and up-to-date response regarding the representation of Arizona's 9th congressional district, thus alleviating potential model illusions related to overconfidence in its outputs.\n\n**Answer:**\nGreg Stanton represents Arizona's 9th district in the House of Representatives. He has been serving since the district's creation in 2013 and was re-elected in the most recent election cycle."}], "question_info": {"question": "who represents the arizona 9th district in the house", "passages": ["Arizona's 7th congressional district is a congressional district located in the U.S. state of Arizona.
