One of the main goals of the Democratic Party is to promote social justice and equality. This encompasses a wide range of issues, including access to healthcare, education, civil rights, and addressing economic inequality. \n\nTo enhance the understanding of this goal, it is important to consider the broader context of democratic values that many political parties around the world share. For instance, the Democratic Party in Hong Kong focuses on economic stability and welfare, which reflects a similar commitment to improving the quality of life for its constituents. This parallel can help illustrate how the U.S. Democratic Party's emphasis on social justice is part of a larger global trend among democratic parties to advocate for the rights and welfare of marginalized communities.\n\nAdditionally, the New Democratic Party (NDP) in Canada highlights the importance of coalition-building and tactical voting, which can inform the U.S. Democratic Party's strategies in elections. Understanding these dynamics can provide insight into how the Democratic Party seeks to mobilize support for its social justice initiatives.\n\nFurthermore, the emphasis on promoting democracy and educating the populace, as seen in the context of political parties in Tibet, underscores the importance of civic engagement and awareness in achieving social justice. This aligns with the Democratic Party's goal of ensuring that all individuals have equal opportunities to succeed, which often involves government intervention to support those in need.\n\nBy integrating these perspectives, we can see that the Democratic Party's commitment to social justice and equality is not only a domestic concern but also part of a broader international movement toward democratic governance and the protection of individual rights.\n\n### Answer:\nOne of the main goals of the Democratic Party is to promote social justice and equality, which includes advocating for policies that ensure access to healthcare, education, civil rights, and addressing economic inequality.
