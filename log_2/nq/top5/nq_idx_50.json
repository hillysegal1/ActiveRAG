The Thames River is one of the most significant rivers in England, and its course is well-documented.\n2. To determine where the Thames begins, I need to identify its source. The river originates in the Cotswolds, specifically at a location called Thames Head, near the village of Kemble in Gloucestershire.\n3. Next, I need to find out where the Thames River ends.
