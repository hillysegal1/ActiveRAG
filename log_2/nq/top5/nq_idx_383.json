US Highway 1 (US 1) is a significant north-south highway in the United States, primarily serving the East Coast and recognized as one of the longest highways in the country.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: US 1 begins in Key West, Florida, which is notable for being the southernmost point of the continental United States. This geographical significance establishes the highway's role as a vital route for travel and commerce originating from the southern tip of the country.\n\n2. **Route Description**: The highway travels northward through various states along the eastern seaboard, passing through major cities such as Miami, Jacksonville, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, Boston, and Portland. This connectivity highlights US 1's importance in linking urban centers and facilitating regional travel.\n\n3. **Northern Terminus**: The highway's northern terminus is at Fort Kent, Maine, near the Canada\u2013United States border. This endpoint signifies the highway's role in international connectivity and trade, as it provides access to Canada.\n\n4. **Geographical Context**: US 1 closely parallels Interstate 95 (I-95) for much of its length but is generally situated further inland between certain points (e.g., Jacksonville, Florida, to Petersburg, Virginia). Understanding this relationship allows for insights into traffic patterns and regional accessibility.\n\n5. **Historical Context**: Established in 1926, the U.S. Highway system, including US 1, has undergone various designations and changes over time. This historical perspective is crucial for understanding how infrastructure development has evolved and how it impacts current travel routes.\n\n6. **Route Characteristics in New Jersey**: In New Jersey, US 1 enters from Pennsylvania and runs through several cities, merging with US 9 in Woodbridge and continuing to the George Washington Bridge. This specific routing illustrates the highway's integration into the broader transportation network.\n\nBy synthesizing this information, I can infer that US Highway 1 serves not only as a critical transportation route but also as a facilitator of economic activity and urban development along the East Coast.
