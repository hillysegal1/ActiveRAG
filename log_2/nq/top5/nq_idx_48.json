The 1984 election was characterized by a strong incumbent in Ronald Reagan, whose approval ratings had rebounded. Mondale's selection of Ferraro was not just about representation; it was a calculated move to differentiate his campaign from Reagan's.

The main presidential candidates were incumbent President **Ronald Reagan**, who was running for re-election, and former Vice President **Walter Mondale**, who was the Democratic challenger.\n\n1. **Identifying the Running Mates**:\n   - **Ronald Reagan's running mate** was **George H.W. Bush**, who served as Vice President during Reagan's first term. This continuity likely aimed to reinforce the administration's policies and appeal to voters who supported Reagan's first term.\n   - **Walter Mondale's running mate** was **Geraldine Ferraro**, who made history as the first woman to be nominated for vice president by a major U.S. political party. This choice was significant not only for its historical context but also for its strategic aim to attract female voters and progressives, reflecting a shift in the political landscape towards inclusivity.\n\n2. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - The selection of vice presidential candidates often reflects broader campaign strategies. Mondale's choice of Ferraro was a calculated move to galvanize support among women and younger voters, showcasing a shift in the Democratic Party's approach to representation.\n   - Reagan's choice of Bush emphasized stability and experience, appealing to traditional conservative voters who valued continuity in leadership.\n\n3. **Historical Context**:\n   - The 1984 election occurred during a time of economic recovery in the U.S., and both candidates framed their campaigns around contrasting visions for the future. Understanding the historical significance of these choices helps to contextualize the political climate of the time.\n\n4. **Impact of Candidate Selection**:\n   - The impact of candidate selection on voter perception and electoral outcomes is crucial. Ferraro's nomination represented a breakthrough for women in politics, which could influence voter turnout and engagement among demographics that felt underrepresented.\n\nBy synthesizing these insights, we can enhance the model's causal reasoning and logical inference capabilities, particularly in understanding the implications of candidate selection, campaign strategies, and historical context in political analysis.\n\n### Answer:\nIn the 1984 U.S. presidential election, the candidates running for vice president were **George H.W.
