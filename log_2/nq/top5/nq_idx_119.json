The division into East and West Sussex has roots that date back to the late medieval period, where it was primarily for taxation purposes. This historical context is crucial for understanding the significance of the later formal division.\n\n2. **Formalization of the Division**:\n   - The formal split of Sussex into East Sussex and West Sussex occurred in 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972. This act was part of a broader reorganization of local government in England and Wales, which aimed to create more efficient administrative structures.\n\n3. **Legislative Framework**:\n   - The Local Government Act 1972 provided the legal basis for the creation of new administrative counties. This act not only established East and West Sussex as separate entities but also involved significant changes to the boundaries of these counties, reflecting a shift in governance and administrative responsibilities.\n\n4. **Changes in Boundaries**:\n   - The division was not merely a renaming; it involved the transfer of specific areas between the two counties. For example, areas such as East Grinstead, Haywards Heath, Burgess Hill, and Hassocks were transferred from East Sussex to West Sussex. This illustrates the practical implications of the division, affecting local governance and community identity.\n\n5. **Impact on Local Governance**:\n   - The establishment of East and West Sussex as separate administrative counties meant that each would have its own local government, responsible for local services and administration. This change was significant for residents, as it altered how local governance was structured and how services were delivered.\n\n6. **Subsequent Changes**:\n   - Even after the division in 1974, further administrative changes occurred, such as the amalgamation of Brighton and Hove into a unitary authority in 1997.

This historical precedent laid the groundwork for the eventual formal division into East Sussex and West Sussex.\n\n2. **Legislative Framework**: The formal split occurred in 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972. This act was significant not only for establishing the administrative boundaries of East and West Sussex but also for reorganizing local governance across England and Wales. It allowed for adjustments to boundaries, which included the transfer of certain areas, such as Crawley and parts of the rape of Lewes, from East Sussex to West Sussex.\n\n3. **Geographic Implications**: The 1974 reorganization had profound geographic implications, defining new administrative boundaries that affected local governance and resource distribution. The transfer of Gatwick Airport from Surrey to West Sussex exemplifies how geographic and economic considerations influenced the division, impacting regional development and identity.\n\n4. **Ongoing Evolution of Governance**: The division of Sussex is not a static event; it reflects an ongoing evolution in governance. The amalgamation of Brighton and Hove into a unitary authority in 1997 illustrates how local governance structures continue to adapt to contemporary needs, indicating that the division's significance extends beyond its initial establishment.\n\n5. **Cultural Ramifications**: The establishment of East and West Sussex has fostered distinct regional identities, influencing local traditions, dialects, and community pride.

This highlights the dynamic nature of administrative boundaries and how they can be influenced by various factors, including urban development and legislative decisions.\n\n5. **Post-War Developments**: The New Towns Act 1946, which designated Crawley as a new town, illustrates how post-war policies influenced local governance and urban planning. This context is vital for understanding the broader implications of the 1972 Act and the subsequent changes in county boundaries.\n\n6. **Temporal Sequencing**: The timeline of events shows that the division of Sussex was not an isolated incident but part of a broader trend of administrative reorganization in response to changing social and economic conditions. This temporal understanding allows for better predictions about future changes based on historical patterns.\n\n7. **Integration of Multiple Factors**: The model can synthesize information from various domains, recognizing that changes in county boundaries are influenced by a combination of historical, legislative, and socio-economic factors. This multifactorial approach enhances the model's ability to draw logical conclusions about similar situations.\n\n### Answer:\nSussex split into East Sussex and West Sussex in 1974, following the Local Government Act 1972, which reorganized local government in England and Wales.
