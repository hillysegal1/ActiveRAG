This is confirmed in the second passage.\n\n2. **Identifying the First Recipient**: The passages do not explicitly state who the first recipient of the Jnanpith Award was. However, the mention of various authors receiving the award in different languages suggests that the first recipient may not have been an author in English, as the first Indian writer in English to receive the award was conferred in December 2018, which is much later than the award's inception in 1961.\n\n3. **Contradictory Information**: The passages indicate that the first Jnanpith Award was awarded for Urdu literature in 1969, as noted in the last passage. This suggests that the first recipient was likely an author writing in Urdu, contradicting any assumption that the first recipient was an author in English or another language.\n\n4. **Updating Model Knowledge**: The model's knowledge should be updated to reflect that:\n   - The first Jnanpith Award was awarded in 1965 (not 1969 as stated in the last passage) to G.

Shankar Kurup for Malayalam literature in 1965.\n- The first Jnanpith Award for Urdu literature was awarded in 1969.\n- The first Indian writer in English to receive the award was in 2018. \n\nThis clarification helps to delineate the timeline and the languages associated with the recipients of the Jnanpith Award."}, {"role": "user", "content": " Here is an answer generated by a language model with the reasoning process.\nquestion:\nthe recipient of first jnanpith award was an author which language\nanswer:\nReasoning process: \nThe Jnanpith Award is one of the most prestigious literary awards in India, established in 1961.
