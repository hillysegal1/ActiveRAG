However, by **1946**, kudzu had spread extensively and began to grow unchecked due to favorable climate conditions. This unchecked growth led to ecological disruption, prompting the USDA to remove kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants in **1953** and classify it as a weed by **1970**.

The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government-aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government-funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare. By 1946, it was estimated that of kudzu had been planted. When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms, kudzu plantings were left unattended.
