It is essential to differentiate between indigenous peoples and European settlers.\n\n2. **Historical Context**:\n   - European exploration began in the late 15th century, with significant figures like Christopher Columbus making voyages starting in 1492. However, Columbus did not establish settlements in the present-day United States.\n\n3. **First Successful Settlement**:\n   - The first successful European settlement in the area that is now the United States was established by the Spanish in St. Augustine, Florida, in 1565. This settlement is recognized as the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in the continental United States.\n\n4. **Subsequent Settlements**:\n   - Following St. Augustine, other European nations, including the French and the English, began to establish settlements in the 17th century. However, these settlements occurred after the initial Spanish establishment.\n\n5. **Later Non-Native Settlers**:\n   - In the 19th century, particularly around 1835, a new wave of non-Native settlers, primarily from New England, began to arrive in various regions of the U.S. These settlers, known as \"Yankee\" settlers, were influenced by events such as the end of the Black Hawk War and the completion of the Erie Canal. They were predominantly members of the Congregational Church and faced a largely untouched environment.\n\n6. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - The arrival of these settlers was influenced by significant historical events, demonstrating a clear causal relationship between historical developments and settlement patterns. Understanding these dynamics can enhance the model's ability to analyze how events influence population movements and cultural shifts.\n\n7. **Demographic and Environmental Factors**:\n   - The demographic composition of these settlers and their interactions with the environment provide insights into how cultural and religious backgrounds shape community development. The model can learn to infer how these factors contribute to the evolution of societal structures.\n\n8. **Temporal Dynamics**:\n   - The model should recognize that the demographic landscape of the U.S. has changed over time, with subsequent waves of immigrants from different regions (e.g., Germany and Ireland in the late 1870s) further diversifying the population.\n\n### Answer:\nThe first non-native settlers in the U.S. were the Spanish in St. Augustine, Florida, established in 1565.
