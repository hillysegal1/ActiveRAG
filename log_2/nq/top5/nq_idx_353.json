The most famous instance is Felix Baumgartner, who performed a jump from the stratosphere on October 14, 2012, as part of the Red Bull Stratos project. He ascended to an altitude of about 128,000 feet (approximately 39 kilometers) in a helium balloon and then jumped, breaking several records, including the highest freefall jump.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the term \"jumped from space\" can also encompass other contexts. For instance, the retrieved passages mention a man who jumped from the Space Mountain rollercoaster at Disneyland on January 29, 2019. While this is not a jump from space in the traditional sense, it highlights the broader interpretation of \"jumping\" in various contexts.\n\nAdditionally, the passage about Paul D. Baker, who jumped from the Space Needle in a successful suicide attempt on March 4, 1974, provides another example of notable jumps from high places, albeit in a tragic context. This emphasizes the need to differentiate between various types of jumps and their implications.\n\nFurthermore, the cultural reference to \"The Man Who Fell to Earth,\" starring David Bowie, suggests that the concept of jumping from space can also be interpreted metaphorically or in a fictional context. This distinction is important for understanding how the phrase may be used in different discussions.\n\nLastly, the fictional narrative about Grava of the Earth colony Extal jumping from a spaceship into a comet tail illustrates how science fiction can shape public perceptions of space travel and jumping, which may influence how people interpret real-life events.\n\nIn summary, while Felix Baumgartner is the most notable individual associated with a jump from space, the broader context includes various interpretations and instances of jumping from significant heights, both real and fictional.\n\n**Answer:** Felix Baumgartner is the most famous person who jumped from space, performing a stratospheric jump on October 14, 2012, as part of the Red Bull Stratos project. However, it's important to recognize that the term \"jumped from space\" can also refer to other contexts, such as the man who jumped from the Space Mountain rollercoaster at Disneyland in 2019, or Paul D. Baker's jump from the Space Needle in 1974.
