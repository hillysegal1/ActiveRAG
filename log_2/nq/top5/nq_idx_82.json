The potential for using fingerprints in forensic science was proposed by Dr. Henry Faulds in 1880, laying the groundwork for future developments. Sir Francis Galton later contributed significantly to the scientific study of fingerprints, classifying them into distinct patterns, which facilitated their acceptance in legal contexts.\n\nThe first systematic use of fingerprints in a police investigation is often attributed to Juan Vucetich in Argentina in 1892, where he successfully used fingerprints to solve a murder case. This event marked a pivotal moment in the application of fingerprinting in law enforcement. \n\nIn the early 1900s, the method gained further traction with the establishment of the Metropolitan Police Fingerprint Bureau in Britain on July 1, 1901, which was the first of its kind. Scotland Yard began fingerprinting individuals around the same time, and the first case of identification, arrest, and conviction based on fingerprint evidence in the United States occurred in the Scheffer case in 1902.\n\nBy understanding the timeline and contributions of key figures, the model can better infer the causal relationships between the development of fingerprinting techniques and their eventual implementation in law enforcement.

Soon after, American police departments adopted the same method and fingerprint identification became a standard practice in the United States. The Scheffer case of 1902 is the first case of the identification, arrest, and conviction of a murderer based upon fingerprint evidence. Alphonse Bertillon identified the thief and murderer Scheffer, who had previously been arrested and his fingerprints filed some months before, from the fingerprints found on a fractured glass showcase, after a theft in a dentist's apartment where the dentist's employee was found dead. It was able to be proved in court that the fingerprints had been made after the showcase was broken. \\n\", 'On August 23, 1995, the BPD became the first police agency to send fingerprint images to the FBI electronically using the newly created EFIPS (now IAFIS) system.
