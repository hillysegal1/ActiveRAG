Chuck Berry is recognized as a pivotal figure in rock and roll music, with his most significant recordings occurring during the 1950s.\n\n1. **Primary Label - Chess Records**: \n   - Chuck Berry primarily recorded for **Chess Records**, a label that played a crucial role in the development of rock and roll and blues music. Chess Records was founded in 1950 and became a prominent label for African American artists. Notable hits by Berry, including \"Maybellene,\" \"Johnny B. Goode,\" and \"Roll Over Beethoven,\" were released under this label. The passages confirm this association:\n     - \"Chuck Berry in London is the eighth studio album by Chuck Berry, released in 1965 by Chess Records.\"\n     - \"Chuck Berry on Stage is the first live album by Chuck Berry, released in 1963 by Chess Records.\"\n     - \"St. Louis to Liverpool is the seventh studio album and tenth album overall by rock and roll artist Chuck Berry, released in 1964 on Chess Records.\"\n\n2. **Other Labels**: \n   - While Chuck Berry did record with **Mercury Records** in the later part of his career, specifically with the album \"Chuck Berry in Memphis\" released in 1967, this was after the primary period of the 1950s and 1960s. The mention of Mercury Records indicates that while he had other affiliations, his most influential work was with Chess.\n\n3. **Brief Lease from Chess Records**: \n   - The mention of a brief lease from Chess Records in the late 1950s suggests that even during transitional periods, his primary association remained with Chess. This reinforces the idea that Chess Records was integral to his identity as an artist during this time.\n\n### Temporal Relationships and Context:\n- The timeline of Chuck Berry's career illustrates that his most impactful recordings were made during the 1950s and 1960s, predominantly under Chess Records. This understanding allows us to infer that the label's support and promotion were significant factors in his success and the broader rock and roll movement.\n\n### Categorization and Inference of Impact:\n- Recognizing Chess Records as the primary label for Berry enables the model to categorize artists based on their affiliations, which is essential for logical inference in music history.
