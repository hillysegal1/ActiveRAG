For instance, knowing that Bruno is Ayrton's nephew allows for inferences about expectations, legacy, and emotional ties in competitive environments.\n\n2. **Impact of Events**: The model can analyze how significant events (like Ayrton's death) can affect the decisions and emotional states of individuals (Bruno's initial withdrawal from racing). This teaches the model to connect events with their consequences, enhancing its ability to predict outcomes based on prior knowledge.\n\n3. **Emotional Context**: The emotional significance of Bruno's signing with Williams can be used to infer motivations behind decisions in competitive sports. Understanding that personal history can influence professional choices helps the model make nuanced inferences about human behavior.\n\n4. **Career Trajectories**: The model can learn to trace career paths and the factors that influence them, such as family legacy, personal aspirations, and external circumstances (like the loss of a family member).
