Linnaeus named the orangutan \"Simia satyrus\" (\"satyr monkey\"). He placed the three genera \"Homo\", \"Simia\" and \"Lemur\" in the order of Primates.\n", "Australopithecus afarensis (Latin: \"Southern ape from Afar\") is an extinct hominin that lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago in Africa. \"A. afarensis\" was slenderly built, like the younger \"Australopithecus africanus\". \"A. afarensis\" is thought to be more closely related to the genus \"Homo\" (which includes the modern human species \"Homo sapiens\"), whether as a direct ancestor or a close relative of an unknown ancestor, than any other known primate from the same time. Some researchers include \"A. afarensis\" in the genus \"Praeanthropus\".\n"], "__answers__": ["Hobbits", "Hobbit", "hobbit", "JRR Tolkien/Hobbits", "hobbitish", "Hobit", "hobbit hole", "Holbytlan", "holbytlan", "Fallohides", "Fallohide", "smial", "Stoor", "Hobbitish", "stoor", "hobbitry", "holbytla", "hobbitses", "hobbit tolkien", "hobbit holes", "pheriannath", "kuduk", "Stoors", "Periannath", "Hobbitry", "fallohides", "stoors", "Hobbitses", "Holbytla", "hobit", "Hobbit hole", "Kuduk", "Harfoots", "periannath", "harfoot", "holbyta", "Hobbit (Tolkien)", "Pheriannath", "Hobbit-hole", "Holbyta", "harfoots", "hobbits", "Harfoot", "jrr tolkien hobbits", "fallohide", "Smial", "A hobbit", "Hobbit holes"]}}
