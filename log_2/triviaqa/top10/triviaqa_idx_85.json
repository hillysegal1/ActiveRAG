The key characteristics of the Chillingham Bull include its predominantly white coat, which is a defining feature of this breed. However, it is important to note that while the body of the Chillingham Bull is primarily white, it also has colored ears, specifically red ears. This detail is crucial as it distinguishes Chillingham cattle from related breeds, such as White Park cattle, which typically have black ears.\n\nThe information retrieved indicates that Chillingham cattle are generally described as \"white with coloured ears,\" and the specific mention of \"ear-colour is red\" highlights the unique trait of this breed. Additionally, the passages mention that Chillingham cattle possess a generally primitive conformation, which may provide further context regarding their overall appearance.\n\nIn summary, the Chillingham Bull is primarily white, but it is essential to acknowledge the distinctive red ears that accompany its white coat. This nuanced understanding helps prevent factual errors and alleviates model illusions regarding the characteristics of The Chillingham Bull.\n\n### Answer:\nThe Chillingham Bull is primarily white with distinctive red ears."}], "question_info": {"question": "What colour was The Chillingham Bull?", "passages": ["The school colours were originally scarlet and silver, as an ode to the coat of arms of Winston Churchill, they have since been changed to black, white, grey and purple after a deal with the Western Ontario Mustangs team.
