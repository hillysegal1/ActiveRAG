It is important to differentiate between Warhol's various projects with different car companies.\n\n4. **Previous Collaborations**: Warhol had previously worked with BMW in 1979 for the BMW Art Car Project, where he painted a Group 4 race version of the BMW M1. This establishes a precedent for his involvement with automotive brands.\n\n5. **Correct Commissioning Entity**: However, the specific series titled \"Cars,\" which aimed to track the evolution of Mercedes-Benz designs, was commissioned by Mercedes-Benz in 1986. This is a crucial detail that distinguishes it from his earlier work with BMW.\n\n6. **Artistic Contributions**: Warhol's \"Cars\" series included 36 silkscreen prints and 13 drawings of eight Mercedes models, which were intended to showcase the brand's design evolution. The fact that the series was unfinished at the time of his death in 1987 adds complexity to the understanding of the project and its significance.\n\n7. **Causal Relationships**: The commissioning of Warhol by Mercedes-Benz can be seen as a strategic move to enhance the brand's image through association with a renowned artist, thereby linking art with automotive innovation and luxury.\n\n8. **Implications of Unfinished Work**: The unfinished nature of the series at Warhol's death may influence how the artworks are perceived in terms of artistic intent and the legacy of both the artist and the brand.\n\n9. **Cultural Significance**: The integration of Warhol's art into Mercedes-Benz's corporate collection reflects the intersection of art and commerce, suggesting that companies often leverage artistic collaborations to communicate values such as creativity, innovation, and cultural relevance.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy synthesizing this information, I can confidently conclude that the car company that commissioned the \"Cars\" series from Andy Warhol in 1986 is Mercedes-Benz, not BMW.
