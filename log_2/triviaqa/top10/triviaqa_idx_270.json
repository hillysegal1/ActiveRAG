The term \"Mormon,\" while historically prevalent and widely recognized, is increasingly discouraged by the church itself. This shift reflects a desire to emphasize the church's full name, which highlights its focus on Jesus Christ. \n\n1. **Historical Context**: The term \"Mormon\" originated from the Book of Mormon, a central text in the faith.
