The passages indicate that the earliest evidence of complete reef structures dates back approximately **600,000 years**. This provides a context for understanding the reef's long-term geological evolution.\n\n2. **Current Living Reef Structure**: The most critical piece of information is that the current living reef structure began growing about **20,000 years ago**, following the Last Glacial Maximum. This period marked significant changes in sea levels, which allowed coral to flourish and form the reef we see today.\n\n3. **Coral Lifespan and Growth**: While the entire reef system has a geological history of tens of thousands of years, the individual coral polyps that make up the living part of the reef have much shorter lifespans. Coral polyps can live for several years, but the living structures are continuously replenished and can be considered relatively young in terms of their individual growth cycles.\n\n4. **Cultural Context**: The long-standing connection of Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders to the reef, with histories spanning **40,000** and **10,000 years**, respectively, adds cultural significance to the reef's ecological importance. However, this does not directly impact the biological age of the living coral.\n\n5. **Coral Growth Dynamics**: It is important to note that while the living coral structures are part of a much older geological framework, the living coral itself is continuously growing and regenerating. This means that while the reef as a whole has a long history, the specific living coral formations are much younger.\n\nBased on the above points, we can conclude that the living part of the Great Barrier Reef, which began its growth approximately **20,000 years ago**, is significantly older than the individual coral polyps that may only live for **5 to 10 years**.

The living part of the reef is primarily made up of coral, which grows over time. Coral reefs can take thousands of years to form, but the living coral itself is much younger. \n\nThe Great Barrier Reef as a whole has been developing for approximately 20,000 to 30,000 years, but the living coral structures that we see today are typically much younger. Most of the living coral in the reef is estimated to be around 5 to 10 years old, as coral polyps continuously grow and die, and new coral is formed from the remnants of older corals.\n\nTherefore, while the entire reef system has a long geological history, the living part of it is relatively young.\n\nAnswer:\nApproximately 5 to 10 years old.\nTo improve the language model's causal reasoning and logical inference capabilities.\nI retrieved some knowledge that can help enhance the language model's causal reasoning and logical inference abilities.\nknowledge:\nTo enhance the model's causal reasoning and logical inference abilities, we can extract and consolidate relevant information from the provided passages regarding the age and formation of the Great Barrier Reef.

The earliest evidence of complete reef structures dates back **600,000 years**, with coral skeleton deposits found that are **half a million years** old. This indicates that the foundation for the current reef system has been established over a very long period.\n\n2. **Current Living Structures**: The living part of the Great Barrier Reef, primarily composed of coral polyps, is believed to have begun its growth approximately **20,000 years ago**. This aligns with the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, when rising sea levels allowed coral to flourish in the warmer waters.\n\n3. **Coral Lifespan and Growth**: While the reef itself has been developing for thousands of years, the individual coral polyps that make up the living structures are much younger. Coral polyps have a relatively short lifespan, typically ranging from **5 to 10 years** for individual polyps, but they continuously grow and regenerate, forming new colonies from the remnants of older corals.\n\n4. **Cultural Context**: The presence of Aboriginal Australians for at least **40,000 years** and Torres Strait Islanders for about **10,000 years** highlights the long-standing relationship between humans and the reef, which may influence conservation efforts and ecological understanding.\n\n5. **Interconnectedness of Events**: Understanding the relationship between geological events (like the Last Glacial Maximum) and biological developments (the growth of coral reefs) enhances our ability to reason about cause and effect over long periods. This interconnectedness is crucial for understanding the dynamics of the reef ecosystem.\n\nBased on this enhanced reasoning process, we can conclude that while the entire reef system has a long geological history, the living part of the reef, which consists of coral polyps, is primarily around **20,000 years old**.
