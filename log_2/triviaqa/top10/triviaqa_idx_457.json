The eastern coast of Russia is bordered by the Pacific Ocean, and several islands are present in this area. \n\n1. **Geographical Context**: The most prominent islands off the east coast of Russia include Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands. Sakhalin is known for its elongated shape and is located north of Japan, making it a strong candidate for the description of a long narrow island.\n\n2. **Sakhalin Island**: \n   - It is the largest island in Russia and has a length of approximately 948 kilometers (589 miles) and a width that varies, making it long and narrow in shape.\n   - It is situated between the Sea of Okhotsk to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east.\n   - The island has a complex history and is known for its diverse ecosystems and significant natural resources.\n\n3. **Russky Island**: \n   - While Russky Island is notable, it is smaller and not described as long and narrow.
