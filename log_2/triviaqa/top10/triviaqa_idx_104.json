While none of the passages explicitly mention fencing, the context of Olympic gold medallists suggests a connection to a sport that has produced notable French athletes.\n\n2. **Olympic Participation**: The passages discuss various sports and Olympic participation, but none provide direct evidence of fencing or the specific athletes mentioned.
