His journey is marked by numerous achievements, including winning the Conditional Jump Jockeys Title in his first season and the Champion Jockey title for 20 consecutive years until his retirement in 2015.\n\n2. **Milestone Achievements**: The passages indicate that McCoy rode his 4000th winner on November 7, 2013. This victory was achieved while riding a horse named Mountain Tunes.\n\n3. **Racecourse Identification**: The specific racecourse where this milestone occurred is Towcester Racecourse, located in Northamptonshire, England. This detail is crucial as it highlights the significance of the event within McCoy's career.\n\n4. **Causal Relationships**: Understanding the sequence of McCoy's achievements can enhance the model's ability to infer causation. For example, his early successes likely contributed to his confidence and skill development, leading to later milestones such as the 4000th win. Recognizing that each achievement builds upon previous experiences can help the model understand the importance of progression in a career.\n\n5. **Temporal Reasoning**: The dates associated with McCoy's milestones allow for an understanding of the timeline of his career. For instance, knowing that he reached his 3000th winner at Plumpton on February 9, 2009, provides context for the significance of reaching 4000 wins four years later.\n\n6. **Contextual Relationships**: The significance of the 4000th win extends beyond the number itself; it represents a culmination of years of hard work, dedication, and consistent performance.
