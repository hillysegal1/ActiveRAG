This foundational knowledge is crucial for understanding the layout of the game.\n\n2. **Identifying Square Types**: The board features various types of squares that provide scoring bonuses, including double letter (DL), triple letter (TL), double word (DW), and triple word (TW) squares. Recognizing these categories is essential for analyzing the board's scoring potential.\n\n3. **Non-Multiplier Squares**: It is noted that there are 164 squares that do not provide any word or letter multipliers. This information helps narrow down the number of squares that do have scoring attributes.\n\n4. **Calculating Multiplier Squares**: By subtracting the number of non-multiplier squares from the total squares, we find that there are 61 squares that have scoring attributes (225 total - 164 non-multiplier = 61 squares). This calculation is a critical step in understanding the distribution of scoring squares.\n\n5. **Locating Double-Word Score Squares**: The double-word score squares are specifically marked and located at certain coordinates on the board. These coordinates are:\n   - (1, 1), (1, 15)\n   - (15, 1), (15, 15)\n   - (1, 8), (8, 1), (8, 15), (15, 8)\n   - The center square (8, 8) is not a double-word score square.\n\n6. **Counting Double-Word Score Squares**: By counting the identified coordinates, we confirm that there are 8 double-word score squares on the board. This step reinforces the importance of spatial reasoning and counting in logical deduction.\n\n7. **Logical Deduction and Causal Reasoning**: The reasoning process demonstrates how to derive the number of double-word score squares through a combination of understanding the board structure, identifying square types, and performing calculations. This enhances the model's ability to make logical deductions based on given premises and to categorize information effectively.\n\n8. **Application of Knowledge**: The knowledge extracted from the passages and the logical deductions made can be applied to various contexts, improving the model's overall reasoning abilities.
