However, we are specifically looking for a station that is built on a bridge over the river itself.\n\n1. **London Bridge Station**: \n   - London Bridge is a central railway terminus located in Southwark, south-east London. It is one of the oldest railway stations in the world, having opened in 1836, and it serves as a major hub for both mainline and underground services. The station is indeed situated directly over the River Thames, making it a prominent landmark in the city. This aligns with the requirement of the question, as it is not only a famous station but also literally located on a bridge over the river.\n\n2. **Other Stations**: \n   - While other stations like Waterloo and Charing Cross are close to the River Thames, they are not built on bridges over the river. This distinction is crucial in narrowing down the options to find the correct answer.\n\n3. **Fulham Railway Bridge**: \n   - Although Fulham Railway Bridge crosses the River Thames, it is not a railway station but rather a bridge that carries the London Underground District line. This information helps to clarify the types of infrastructure present in London but does not contribute to identifying a railway station.\n\n4. **City Thameslink**: \n   - City Thameslink is another central London railway station, but it is not located on a bridge over the Thames. It serves as part of the Thameslink route, which connects various parts of London but does not meet the criteria of being situated on a bridge.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   - Based on the information gathered, London Bridge Station is the only railway station that fits the description of being located on a bridge over the River Thames.
