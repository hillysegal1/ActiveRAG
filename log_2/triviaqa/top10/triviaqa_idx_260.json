Thus, before her marriage, she was made to renounce all succession rights she had had for herself and her descendants by Louis.\\n', 'As with other Spanish noble titles, the dukedom of Segorbe descended according to cognatic primogeniture, meaning that females could inherit the title if they had no brothers (or if their brothers had no issue).

A second category of \"infantes\" may be granted that title by royal decree (\"infantes by grace\"), but only bear the style of Highness. Previously, the title and rank of \"infante of Spain\" was often granted to relatives and in-laws of Spain\\'s monarchs, but unlike those created under the 1987 decree, their dynastic wives were automatically \"infantas\" and bearers of the title were \"Royal Highnesses\".\\n', 'The Spanish title, with the accompanying dignity of Grandee of Spain, follows the inheritance rules of that country.

This act has not been recognised by members of the branch descended from Prince Gabriel of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. The legality of this has been disputed by Prince Pedro on the grounds that the succession to the Two Sicilies crown was established in two international treaties (Vienna 1737 and Naples 1759) as well as the Pragmatic Decree of 1759 and the nineteenth century Two Sicilies constitutions and therefore could not be changed by a unilateral act, even by an undisputed head of the royal house. The succession to the Constantinian Grand Mastership was confirmed by an Imperial Bull and a Papal Brief, and by the Bull Militantis Ecclesiae, and required that the Grand Mastership, an ecclesiastical office in canon law, could only be held by males and must pass by primogeniture to the heirs of the House of Farnese; the purported change to the succession by Prince Carlo has not been approved by the Holy See.\n", "The present king of Spain, Felipe VI, was the first member of the Borbon dynasty in Spain to have borne this title, which he did while heir apparent to the Spanish crown. Since 19 June 2014, the title has been reserved for Felipe's daughter Leonor, Princess of Asturias, as heiress presumptive to the Spanish crown.\n", "As with other Spanish noble titles, the dukedom of Luna descended according to cognatic primogeniture, meaning that females could inherit the title if they had no brothers (or if their brothers had no issue). That changed in 2006, since when the eldest child (regardless of gender) automatically succeeds to noble family titles.\n", "The end of this dynasty is in dispute. Some historians consider that the House of Arag\u00f3n was extinguished when Ramiro II of Aragon died without male descent, and that later holders of this crown should be called members of the House of Barcelona. However, the marriage provisions of his daughter Petronila say that her husband was never given the title of king, their descendants used both titles, King of Aragon and Count of Barcelona equally. Although the total loss of the Count's family rights and dominions in Occitania, the title of King of Aragon was not prominent until the Trastamara Dynasty was crowned and the monarchs called themselves just \"de Aragon\" (of Aragon).\n"], "__answers__": ["Infante", "infanta of le\u00f3n", "infantes", "Infante of Spain", "infante of spain", "Infanta", "infanta of spain", "Infanta of Le\u00f3n", "infanta infante", "infante", "Infantes", "Infanta of Castile", "infanta of castile", "infanta de castile", "Infanta Infante", "Infanta of Spain", "Infanta de Castile", "infanta"]}}
