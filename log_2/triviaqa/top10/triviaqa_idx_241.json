Although Poland was not an independent country due to partitions by neighboring powers, it is recognized as her birthplace. The retrieved passages consistently affirm that she was \"born in partitioned Poland (Russian Empire)\" and identify her as \"Polish-born.\" This emphasizes her heritage and connection to Poland, despite her later life in France.\n\nAdditionally, the historical context of her birthplace being in a partitioned region is significant for understanding her identity. The term \"Congress Poland\" refers to the area that was under Russian control, which further contextualizes her origins. It is also important to note that while she later became a French citizen and is often associated with France due to her scientific contributions, her roots are firmly in Poland.\n\nGiven this information, Austria and Switzerland are not relevant to her birthplace, and the correct answer remains Poland.\n\n### Answer:\nPoland"}], "question_info": {"question": "In which country was Marie Curie born?
