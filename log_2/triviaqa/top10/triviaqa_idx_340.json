Because the skull cannot expand perpendicular to the fused suture, it compensates by growing more in the direction parallel to the closed sutures. Sometimes the resulting growth pattern provides the necessary space for the growing brain, but results in an abnormal head shape and abnormal facial features. In cases in which the compensation does not effectively provide enough space for the growing brain, craniosynostosis results in increased intracranial pressure leading possibly to visual impairment, sleeping impairment, eating difficulties, or an impairment of mental development combined with a significant reduction in IQ.\n"], "__answers__": ["Fontanel", "Fontanell", "Fontanelle", "Fontanelles", "fonticuli", "fonticuli cranii", "FONTANELLE", "soft spots", "Soft spots", "fontanelle", "depressed fontanelle", "Fontanels", "Depressed fontanelle", "Fonticuli", "soft spot", "Fonticuli cranii", "fontanel", "fontanelles", "Soft spot", "fonticulus", "fontanell", "fontanels", "Fonticulus"]}}
