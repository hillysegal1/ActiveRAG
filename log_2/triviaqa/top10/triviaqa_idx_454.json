However, the passages indicate that Doris Lessing won in 2007, which is also significant but not the most recent.\n\n4. **Final Verification**:\n   - Since the passages do not provide any information about a British winner after Kazuo Ishiguro, I will conclude that he remains the last Briton to win the Nobel Prize for Literature as of the latest information available.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTo prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions, the model should incorporate the information that Doris Lessing won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2007, but it should also recognize that Kazuo Ishiguro is the most recent British laureate, having won in 2017.\n\n### Answer:\nKazuo Ishiguro"}], "question_info": {"question": "Who was the last Briton to win the Nobel Prize for Literature?", "passages": ["BULLET::::- 1998: Whitbread First Novel Award \"The Last King of Scotland\"\n", "As of 2017, the Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to 114 individuals.
