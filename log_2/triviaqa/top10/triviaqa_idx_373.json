Wyoming was the first state to grant women the right to vote in 1869, which is a significant milestone in the history of women's suffrage in the United States. This progressive stance on equality is a key reason for the state's nickname.\n\nFrom the retrieved passages, it is confirmed that Wyoming is explicitly referred to as \"The Equality State\" in multiple authoritative sources. Additionally, while other locations share the term \"Equality\" in their names, such as Equality, Alabama, and Equality, Utah, these do not detract from Wyoming's unique designation as \"The Equality State.\" \n\nTo ensure the language model accurately reflects this information and prevents any potential factual errors or model illusions, it is crucial to reinforce the association of the nickname solely with Wyoming, as supported by the retrieved knowledge. There is no indication in the passages that any other state holds this nickname, thereby affirming the accuracy of the model's understanding.\n\n**Answer: Wyoming**"}], "question_info": {"question": "Which US state is nicknamed The Equality State?", "passages": ["BULLET::::- Fontes, Justin and Fontes, Ron. \"Wyoming: Wyoming, the Equality State\", (Google Books), Gareth Stevens, 2003 ().
