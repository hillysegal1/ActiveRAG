Spencer was working on an active radar set when he noticed a strange sensation, and saw that a peanut candy bar he had in his pocket started to melt. Although he was not the first to notice this phenomenon, as the holder of 120 patents, Spencer was no stranger to discovery and experiment, and realized what was happening. The radar had melted his candy bar with microwaves. The first food to be deliberately cooked with microwaves was popcorn, and the second was an egg. In 1947, Raytheon under Percy Spencer demonstrated the world's first microwave oven built at the company which was called the \"Radarange\".\n", "Christopher Miner Spencer (June 20, 1833 \u2013 January 14, 1922) was an American inventor, from Manchester, Connecticut, who invented the Spencer repeating rifle, one of the earliest models of lever-action rifle, a steam powered \"horseless carriage\", and several other inventions. He developed the first fully automatic turret lathe, which in its small- to medium-sized form is also known as a screw machine.\n", "Percy Lebaron Spencer (July 19, 1894 \u2013 September 8, 1970) was an American physicist and inventor. He became known as the inventor of the microwave oven.\n", "BULLET::::- Percy Spencer (1894\u20131970), American inventor of the microwave oven\n", "BULLET::::- Percy Spencer (1894-1970), American engineer and inventor of the microwave oven\n", "BULLET::::- 1953 \u2014 Electronics engineer Percy Spencer wondered why a candy bar melted in his pocked when he faced a military radar magnetron.

F. Mouromtseff at Westinghouse, and at the 1933 Chicago World's Fair demonstrated cooking meals with a 60\u00a0MHz radio transmitter. In 1945 Percy Spencer, an engineer working on radar at Raytheon, noticed that microwave radiation from a magnetron oscillator melted a candy bar in his pocket. He investigated cooking with microwaves and invented the microwave oven, consisting of a magnetron feeding microwaves into a closed metal cavity containing food, which was patented by Raytheon on 8 October 1945. Due to their expense microwave ovens were initially used in institutional kitchens, but by 1986 roughly 25% of households in the U.S. owned one. Microwave heating became widely used as an industrial process in industries such as plastics fabrication, and as a medical therapy to kill cancer cells in microwave hyperthermy.\n", "The missing technique that made radar practical was the use of pulses to measure range by measuring the time between the transmission of the signal and its reception. This would allow a single station to measure angle and range at the same time. In 1924, two researchers at the Naval Research Laboratory in the United States, Merle Tuve and Gregory Briet, decided to recreate Appleton's experiment using timed pulsed signals instead of the changing wavelengths. The application of this technique to a detection system was not lost on those working in the field, and such a system was prototyped by W. A. S. Butement and P. E. Pollard of the British Signals Experimental Establishment (SEE) in 1931. The British Army War Office proved uninterested in the concept and the development remained little known outside SEE.\n"], "__answers__": ["Microwaving", "Radarange", "Radarange", "Microwavable", "Microwave ovens", "Microwave oven", "microwave ovens", "Microwave cooker", "Microwave Oven", "Radarrange", "radarrange", "microwaving", "radarange", "Browning tray", "Popty ping", "Multimode Applicators", "microwaveable", "cooking microwaving", "browning tray", "microwave cooking", "microwave refrigerator combo", "radar range", "Nuclearator", "multimode applicators", "popty ping", "Cooking/Microwaving", "microwavable", "Multimode Applicator", "microwave oven", "microwave cooker", "Microwave refrigerator combo", "Microwaveable", "multimode applicator", "nuclearator", "Microwave cooking", "Radar range"]}}
