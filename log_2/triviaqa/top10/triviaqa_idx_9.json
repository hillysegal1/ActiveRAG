The Grand National is a notoriously difficult race that has been described as \"the ultimate test of a horse\u2019s courage\". He was also renowned for his jumping ability, having not fallen in 100 races.\\n', \"The race is best remembered for being Red Rum's third Grand National win, a record that still stands today.

Crisp led the field virtually all the way in that year\\'s National in which he was 30 lengths clear, and at the last fence was 15 lengths clear of Red Rum, his nearest pursuer. Red Rum and jockey Brian Fletcher, however, made up the ground on the final stretch and, two strides from the finishing post, pipped the tiring Crisp to win by three-quarters of a length in what is often considered one of the greatest Grand Nationals in history. Crisp\\'s jockey Richard Pitman later stated: \"I still dream about that race, of Crisp running so strongly and jumping so fearlessly, and then the sound of Red Rum\\'s hooves as he got closer and closer at the end.\" He added: \"I felt as though I was tied to a railway line with an express train thundering up and being unable to jump out of the way.\" A year later, Red Rum retained his title at the 1974 National, carrying 12 stone.

Red Rum is celebrated for his remarkable achievements, particularly his record of winning the Grand National three times, which is a feat unmatched by any other horse.\n\n1. **Identifying Winning Years**: From the retrieved knowledge, we know that Red Rum won the Grand National in **1973**, **1974**, and **1977**. These victories are not only significant for Red Rum but also for the history of the Grand National itself, as they highlight his exceptional talent and consistency as a racehorse.\n\n2. **Understanding Runner-up Finishes**: It is also important to note that Red Rum finished second in the years **1975** and **1976**. This information provides context to his performance trajectory, indicating that even in years he did not win, he remained a formidable competitor.\n\n3. **Causal Relationships**: The information allows us to infer potential causal factors contributing to Red Rum's success. His victories in consecutive years suggest a combination of factors such as effective training, physical condition, and perhaps favorable race conditions. The fact that he was able to maintain high performance even in subsequent years (finishing second) indicates resilience and adaptability.\n\n4. **Temporal Reasoning**: The sequence of wins followed by runner-up finishes can lead to further inquiries about the impact of age and experience on performance. For instance, Red Rum was 12 years old during his third win in 1977, which raises questions about how age may affect a horse's racing capabilities.\n\n5. **Statistical Inference**: Red Rum's unique achievement of three Grand National wins allows us to draw broader conclusions about the rarity of such accomplishments in horse racing. This can lead to discussions about the factors that contribute to a horse's success over time, including genetics, training methods, and the competitive landscape of horse racing.\n\n6. **Contextual Understanding**: The Grand National is known for its challenging course and high level of competition. Understanding the nature of this race enhances our ability to infer why Red Rum's achievements are particularly noteworthy. His ability to excel in such a demanding environment speaks to his exceptional skill and determination.\n\nBy synthesizing this information, we can enhance our understanding of Red Rum's achievements and the factors that contributed to his historic status in horse racing.\n\n### Answer:\nRed Rum won the Grand National in 1973, 1974, and 1977."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nIn which three years did Red Rum win the Grand National?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['Red Rum (3 May 1965 \u2013 18 October 1995) was a champion Thoroughbred steeplechaser.
