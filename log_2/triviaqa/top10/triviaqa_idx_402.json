However, I would like to emphasize that the candle also plays a significant role in various cultural and religious contexts. For example, in Kwanzaa celebrations, candles symbolize African American struggles and hopes. This duality of the candle as a symbol of both light and darkness can be seen as a powerful representation of resilience in the face of oppression, which complements the barbed wire's connotation of confinement.\n\n**Expert 3: Religious Studies Scholar**\nBuilding on the points made by Experts 1 and 2, I would like to highlight the candle's significance in religious practices, particularly in Christianity and Buddhism. In Christianity, candles symbolize the light of God and are integral to worship. Similarly, in Buddhism, candles represent the light of the Buddha's teachings. This multifaceted nature of the candle enriches its symbolism when paired with barbed wire, as it can represent the struggle between oppression and spiritual enlightenment.\n\n**Expert 4: Contemporary Symbolism Expert**\nWhile I appreciate the historical and cultural perspectives, I think we should also consider contemporary interpretations of these symbols. The barbed wire's association with confinement is increasingly relevant in discussions about immigration and border control.

However, this project is not an organization in the same sense as Amnesty International.\n\n4. **Symbolic Interpretation**: The combination of barbed wire and a candle in the context of Amnesty International suggests a narrative of recognizing oppression (barbed wire) while simultaneously advocating for hope and justice (candle). This duality enhances the understanding of the organization's mission.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: After analyzing the context and meanings behind the symbols, it is clear that the organization that uses both barbed wire and a candle as its symbols is Amnesty International.
