Before the death of Guru Gobind Singh, the Guru Granth Sahib was declared the eternal guru. Sikhism recognises all humans as equal before Waheguru, regardless of colour, caste or lineage. Sikhism strongly rejects the beliefs of fasting (vrata), superstitions, idol worship and circumcision.\\n', 'The history of Sikhism started with Guru Nanak Dev Ji. He was the first Guru of the fifteenth century in the Punjab region in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. The religious practices were formalised by Guru Gobind Singh Ji on 13 April 1699. The latter baptised five persons from different social backgrounds to form Khalsa (\u0a16\u0a3c\u0a3e\u0a32\u0a38\u0a3e). The first five, Pure Ones, then baptised Gobind Singh into the Khalsa fold.

Nanak's mother was Mata Tripta, and he had one older sister, Bibi Nanki.\\n\", 'Sikhism was founded in Punjab in 1469 by Guru Nanak on the foundations that everyone is equal, regardless of caste, age, or gender. Both men and women were supposed to follow the 5 Ks, Kesh(uncut hair), Kangha(comb), Kara(iron bracelet), Kachera(cotton undergarment) and Kirpan(iron dagger), and there was never a distinction between what a woman should be allowed to do versus as man. Men and women are treated equally in the Temple(Gurdwara), and everyone eats and prays side-by-side. Both men and women are meant to carry the Kirpan with them as they are responsible for their own physical protection, and should not depend on others. Sikhs are strictly against the caste system and many chose to use \"Kaur\" or \"Singh\" as a last names to push against the problematic caste system in India. There is only one God(Waheguru) in Sikhism and they are without form or gender, and everyone is equal in the eyes of god. Many Sikh women believe that this absence of assignment of code of conduct for a woman versus a man, proves that their religion is historically committed to gender equality. Presently, the culture doesn\\'t always follow these traditions and equality is often more true in ideals rather than daily practice. Sikhs are still very respectful to women, however, inequality in the temple and the abortion of female fetuses in Punjab remain a problem. In North America the 5 Ks are mostly just followed by men, however, many religiously devoted women also choose to commit to \"\"Sikh rehni\" - Sikh way of life\". Many Sikh women also choose to wear a turban as a socio-political move to fight inequality in the religion and show their Sikh essentialism. There are also groups which have been formed by Sikhs, like SAFAR, which are committed to uncovering and challenging oppression within the Sikh community, as well as re-establishing equity in the Sikh culture.\\n', 'BULLET::::- 1469\u20131539:The life of Guru Nanak, founder of Sikhism.\\n', 'BULLET::::- Guru Nanak, founder of Sikhism\\n']\n\nTask Description:\nPlease extract content that may be unfamiliar to the model from these passages, \nwhich can provide the model with relevant background and unknown knowledge and concepts, \nhelping it better understand the question. and analyze the role of these contents.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To enhance the model's understanding of the question regarding the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak, we can extract and analyze several key concepts and background information from the provided passages.

He was the first Guru of the fifteenth century in the Punjab region in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. The religious practices were formalised by Guru Gobind Singh Ji on 13 April 1699. The latter baptised five persons from different social backgrounds to form Khalsa (\u0a16\u0a3c\u0a3e\u0a32\u0a38\u0a3e). The first five, Pure Ones, then baptised Gobind Singh into the Khalsa fold. This gives the order of Khalsa, a history of around 300 years.\n", "Guru Nanak Dev (1469\u20131539), founder of Sikhism, was born to Mehta Kalu and Mata Tripta, in the village of Talwandi, now called Nankana Sahib, near Lahore. His father, named Mehta Kalu, was a Patwari, an accountant of land revenue in the government. Nanak's mother was Mata Tripta, and he had one older sister, Bibi Nanki.\n", "Sikhism was founded in Punjab in 1469 by Guru Nanak on the foundations that everyone is equal, regardless of caste, age, or gender. Both men and women were supposed to follow the 5 Ks, Kesh(uncut hair), Kangha(comb), Kara(iron bracelet), Kachera(cotton undergarment) and Kirpan(iron dagger), and there was never a distinction between what a woman should be allowed to do versus as man. Men and women are treated equally in the Temple(Gurdwara), and everyone eats and prays side-by-side. Both men and women are meant to carry the Kirpan with them as they are responsible for their own physical protection, and should not depend on others. Sikhs are strictly against the caste system and many chose to use \"Kaur\" or \"Singh\" as a last names to push against the problematic caste system in India. There is only one God(Waheguru) in Sikhism and they are without form or gender, and everyone is equal in the eyes of god. Many Sikh women believe that this absence of assignment of code of conduct for a woman versus a man, proves that their religion is historically committed to gender equality. Presently, the culture doesn't always follow these traditions and equality is often more true in ideals rather than daily practice. Sikhs are still very respectful to women, however, inequality in the temple and the abortion of female fetuses in Punjab remain a problem. In North America the 5 Ks are mostly just followed by men, however, many religiously devoted women also choose to commit to \"\"Sikh rehni\" - Sikh way of life\". Many Sikh women also choose to wear a turban as a socio-political move to fight inequality in the religion and show their Sikh essentialism. There are also groups which have been formed by Sikhs, like SAFAR, which are committed to uncovering and challenging oppression within the Sikh community, as well as re-establishing equity in the Sikh culture.\n", "BULLET::::- 1469\u20131539:The life of Guru Nanak, founder of Sikhism.\n", "BULLET::::- Guru Nanak, founder of Sikhism\n"], "__answers__": ["Nanak", "Udasis", "Guru Nanak", "sri guru nanak dev ji", "Baba Nanak", "N\u0101nak", "guru nanak dev", "baba nanak", "gurunanak", "nanak dev ji", "dev nanak guru", "Guru Nanak Dev", "sri guru nanak dev ju", "Babur Vani", "Gurunanak", "Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ju", "Guru Nanak Dev ji", "GURU NANAK", "\u0917\u0941\u0930\u0941 \u0928\u093e\u0928\u0915 \u0926\u0947\u0935", "Guru Nanak Dev Ji", "nanak", "Baba Guru Nanak", "Baburvani", "udasis", "baba guru nanak", "nanak dev", "gurunank", "Nanak the first guru", "Sri Guru Nanak", "sri guru nanak dev", "baburvani", "guru nanak sahib", "\u0a17\u0a41\u0a30\u0a42 \u0a28\u0a3e\u0a28\u0a15 \u0a26\u0a47\u0a35", "Nanak Dev", "Guru N\u0101nak", "Guru Nanak Sahib", "Dev, Nanak Guru", "n\u0101nak", "sri guru nanak", "babur vani", "guru nanak", "Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji", "guru nanak dev ji", "nanak first guru", "Sri Guru Nanak Dev", "guru n\u0101nak", "Gurunank", "Nanak Dev Ji", "\u06af\u0631\u0648\u0646\u0627\u0646\u06a9"]}}
