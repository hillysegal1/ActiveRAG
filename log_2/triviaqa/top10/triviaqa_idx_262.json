This convention laid the groundwork for prohibiting certain types of weapons and established principles for humane treatment during conflicts.\n   - **Hague Convention III**: Concerning the Opening of Hostilities, which outlines the rules for initiating warfare, indirectly relating to the use of military force.\n\n2. **Hague Convention of 1907**: This conference expanded upon the earlier conventions and introduced additional regulations:\n   - **Hague Convention IV**: Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, which further clarifies the rules regarding the conduct of hostilities and the use of weapons. It emphasizes the humane treatment of combatants and non-combatants.\n   - **Hague Convention IX**: On Bombardment by Naval Forces in Time of War, which specifically addresses the conduct of naval bombardments and the protection of civilians during such actions.\n\n3. **Prohibition of Chemical Weapons**: The 1899 Hague Convention also included provisions that laid the foundation for the prohibition of chemical weapons, explicitly forbidding the use of poisoned arms. This early stance against inhumane warfare practices resonates with contemporary discussions about the ethics of warfare.\n\n4. **Challenges of Enforcement**: Despite the establishment of these treaties, historical violations during World War I and II highlight the challenges of enforcement and adherence to international law. The Nuremberg and Tokyo Trials later reaffirmed that these laws were recognized by civilized nations, suggesting a moral obligation to uphold them, even for those who did not sign the treaties.\n\n5. **Evolution of International Humanitarian Law**: The principles established in the Hague Conventions influenced later agreements, including the Geneva Conventions. The foundational ideas about the treatment of non-combatants and the regulation of warfare methods continue to inform contemporary legal frameworks.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe international treaties of 1899 and 1907 that cover the use of weapons in war include the following Hague Conventions:\n- **Hague Convention II (1899)**: On the Laws and Customs of War on Land, which addresses the conduct of hostilities and the treatment of prisoners of war, including prohibitions on certain types of weapons.\n- **Hague Convention IV (1907)**: Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, which further clarifies the rules regarding the conduct of hostilities and the use of weapons.\n- **Hague Convention IX (1907)**: On Bombardment by Naval Forces in Time of War, which specifically regulates naval bombardments and the protection of civilians.\n\nThese treaties collectively emphasize the humane treatment of combatants and non-combatants and set limitations on the types of weapons that can be used in warfare. They represent an early attempt to codify humanitarian principles in warfare, influencing later international humanitarian law. However, the challenges of enforcement and adherence to these treaties underscore the complexities of international law in practice, necessitating ongoing evolution and reinforcement of legal frameworks to ensure compliance and protect human rights in armed conflicts."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nWhich international treaties of 1899 and 1907 cover the use of weapons in war?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['International law relating to aerial bombardment before and during World War II rests on the treaties of 1864, 1899, and 1907, which constituted the definition of most of the laws of war at that time \u2014 which, despite repeated diplomatic attempts, was not updated in the immediate run up to World War II.

Key treaties include:\n   - **Convention I**: Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, which further clarifies the rules regarding the conduct of hostilities and the use of weapons.\n   - **Convention II**: On the Limitation of the Employment of Force for Recovery of Contract Debts, which indirectly relates to the use of military force.\n   - **Convention III**: Concerning the Opening of Hostilities, which reiterates the rules for declaring war and the use of force.\n   - **Hague IX**: Laws of War: Bombardment by Naval Forces in Time of War, which specifically addresses the conduct of naval bombardments.\n\n3. **Prohibition of Chemical Weapons**: The model should incorporate that the Hague Convention of 1899 included prohibitions against the use of chemical weapons, specifically through Article 23 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, which prohibited the use of \"poison and poisoned arms.\"\n\n4. **Rights for Non-Combatants**: The model should acknowledge that the Hague Conventions were among the first treaties to agree on rights for non-combatants, which is a significant aspect of the laws of war.\n\n5. **Context of Use**: The model should also note that these treaties were established in the context of international warfare, and many of the laws set forth were recognized and applied even by nations that did not sign the treaties, as evidenced by rulings during the Nuremberg Trials and Tokyo Trials.\n\nIncorporating these details enhances the model's understanding of the historical context and legal framework surrounding the use of weapons in war as established by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, thereby reducing the likelihood of model illusions and factual inaccuracies.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe international treaties of 1899 and 1907 that cover the use of weapons in war include the Hague Conventions, specifically:\n- **Hague Convention II (1899)**: On the Laws and Customs of War on Land, which includes regulations on the conduct of hostilities and the treatment of prisoners of war.\n- **Hague Convention IV (1907)**: Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, which further clarifies the rules regarding the conduct of hostilities and the use of weapons.\n- **Hague IX (1907)**: Laws of War: Bombardment by Naval Forces in Time of War, which specifically addresses the conduct of naval bombardments.\nAdditionally, the Hague Convention of 1899 included prohibitions against the use of chemical weapons and established rights for non-combatants, marking significant advancements in the laws of war."}], "question_info": {"question": "Which international treaties of 1899 and 1907 cover the use of weapons in war?", "passages": ["International law relating to aerial bombardment before and during World War II rests on the treaties of 1864, 1899, and 1907, which constituted the definition of most of the laws of war at that time \u2014 which, despite repeated diplomatic attempts, was not updated in the immediate run up to World War II. The most relevant of these treaties is the Hague Convention of 1907 because it was the last treaty ratified before 1939 which specify the laws of war regarding the use of bombardment. In the Hague Convention of 1907, there are two which have a direct bearing on this issue of bombardment. These are \"Laws of War: Laws and Customs of War on Land (Hague IV); 18 October 1907\" and \"Laws of War: Bombardment by Naval Forces in Time of War (Hague IX); 18 October 1907\". It is significant that there is a different treaty which should be invoked for bombardment of land by land (Hague IV) and of land by sea (Hague IX). Hague IV, which reaffirmed and updated Hague II (1899), contains the following clauses:\n", "The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 were one of the first multi-country treaties to agree on rights for non-combatants. These meetings occurred in 1899 and in 1907. Three treaties were signed and put into effect in 1899, including the treatment of prisoners of war and the protection of hospital ships. In 1907 thirteen additional treaties were signed. These cover regulations concerning war on land, the declaration of war, the rights and responsibilities of neutral countries, and rights and restrictions during naval war.\n", "International law has prohibited the use of chemical weapons since 1899, under the Hague Convention: Article 23 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land adopted by the First Hague Conference \"especially\" prohibited employing \"poison and poisoned arms\". A separate declaration stated that in any war between signatory powers, the parties would abstain from using projectiles \"the object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases\".\n", "Participants in the international Hague Peace Conferences used Lieber's text as the basis for negotiations which resulted in the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. These two international agreements set forth laws of land and naval warfare. Subsequently, during World War I and World War II, many of these laws were broken. Following World War II, jurists at the Nuremberg Trials and the Tokyo Trials ruled that by 1939 the rules for armed conflicts, particularly those concerning belligerent and neutral nationals, had been recognized by all civilized nations and thus could apply to officials even of countries that never signed the Hague Conventions. Some features of the Lieber Code are still evident in the Geneva Conventions of 1949.\n", "The Hague Convention of 1899, Declaration III, prohibited the use in \"international warfare\" of bullets that easily expand or flatten in the body.\n", "On 20 October 1868 the first, unsuccessful, attempt to expand the 1864 treaty was undertaken. With the 'Additional Articles relating to the Condition of the Wounded in War' an attempt was initiated to clarify some rules of the 1864 convention and to extend them to maritime warfare. The Articles were signed but was only ratified by the Netherlands and North America. The Netherlands later withdrew their ratification. The protection of the victims of maritime warfare would later be realized by the third Hague Convention of 1899 and the tenth Hague Convention of 1907.\n", "BULLET::::- 1899 \u2013 International Convention for Adapting to Maritime Warfare the Principles of the Geneva Convention of 22 August 1864 [Hague III] (The Hague, 29 July 1899)\n", "BULLET::::- Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, among the first formal statements of the laws of war and war crimes in international law, signed July 1899 and October 1907\n", "BULLET::::- Geneva Conventions, for the humanitarian treatment of war (1864, 1906, 1929, 1949)\n", "BULLET::::- 1910 \u2013 International Convention respecting Bombardments by Naval Forces in Time of War [Hague IX]\n"], "__answers__": ["Hague Conventions", "Hague Convention", "hague convention", "Hague conventions", "The Hague Convention", "Hague convention", "haig convention", "hague convention disambiguation", "hague conventions", "Hague Convention (disambiguation)", "Haig convention"]}}
