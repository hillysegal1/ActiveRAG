Christie's, founded in 1766, is recognized as the world's largest auction house today. Its long-standing history and significant sales, such as the record-breaking \"Salvator Mundi,\" highlight its prominence in the auction industry. Sotheby's, established shortly before Christie's in 1744, is currently the second-largest auction house. This historical timeline is crucial for understanding the evolution of these institutions and their market positions.\n\n**Expert 2: Market Dynamics**\nI agree with Expert 1 on the historical significance but would like to focus on the market dynamics that have led to Christie's current status. The passage mentions that Christie's had sales totaling \u00a35.3 billion in 2018, which underscores its financial strength. Additionally, the auction of the Rockefeller Collection for $835.1 million illustrates Christie's ability to attract high-value items, which is essential for maintaining its leading position. This financial prowess is a key factor in its dominance over competitors like Sotheby's.\n\n**Expert 3: Global Reach and Operations**\nWhile I concur with the points made about sales figures and historical context, I believe it's important to consider the global reach of these auction houses.

Both of these auction houses have a long-standing history and significant influence in the art and luxury goods markets.\n\n1. **Founding Dates and Historical Context**:\n   - Sotheby's was founded in 1744 by Samuel Baker, making it one of the oldest auction houses in continuous operation.\n   - Christie's was established later, in 1766, by James Christie. Despite being younger, it has grown to become a leading competitor in the auction market.\n\n2. **Current Status and Rankings**:\n   - Christie's is recognized as the world's largest auction house, particularly noted for its high-profile art auctions and significant sales.\n   - Sotheby's, while also a major player, is currently ranked as the second-largest auction house.\n\n3. **Sales Figures**:\n   - In 2018, Christie's reported total sales of \u00a35.3 billion (approximately US$7 billion), which underscores its market dominance.\n   - Sotheby's had global sales of $5.8 billion in 2011, indicating its substantial presence but still falling short of Christie's recent figures.\n\n4. **Significant Auctions**:\n   - Christie's achieved a record sale with the \"Salvator Mundi,\" which sold for $450.3 million, marking the highest price ever paid for a single painting at auction.\n   - Additionally, Christie's conducted the most significant charitable auction with the Collection of Peggy and David Rockefeller, realizing $835.1 million, further solidifying its reputation.\n\n5. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - The historical context of the founding dates allows us to infer that Christie's, despite being founded later, has effectively leveraged its brand and market strategies to surpass Sotheby's in total sales.\n   - The record-breaking auctions and significant sales figures suggest that Christie's has successfully positioned itself as a leader in high-value art sales, which contributes to its status as the largest auction house.\n\nBy synthesizing this information, we can conclude that Christie's not only has a strong historical foundation but also demonstrates superior market performance through significant sales and impactful auctions.
