This range is characterized by its rolling hills and scenic landscapes. Cleeve Hill has an elevation of approximately 1,083 feet (330 meters), confirming its status as the highest point in the Cotswolds. \n\nAdditionally, Cleeve Hill is situated on Cleeve Common, which is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). This designation highlights the ecological and geological significance of the area, indicating that it is managed by a charity known as the Cleeve Common Trust. The hill is composed of Jurassic limestone, which contributes to its geological importance and provides insight into the region's natural history.\n\nFurthermore, the south slopes of Cleeve Hill drain into the River Coln, making it the highest point in the drainage basin of the River Thames. This geographical detail adds to the understanding of Cleeve Hill's significance within the broader hydrological context of the area.\n\nBy incorporating this comprehensive information, the model can better understand Cleeve Hill's geographical, ecological, and geological importance, thus preventing factual errors and alleviating model illusions.\n\n**Answer: Cotswolds**"}], "question_info": {"question": "Cleeve Hill is the highest point in which range of English hills?", "passages": ["Cleeve Hill overlooks the town and is the highest point in the county of Gloucestershire at 1,083 feet (330 m).\n", "BULLET::::- Cleeve Hill, the highest point in the Cotswolds\n", "Cleeve Hill is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) based in Berkshire, England, near Eastbury.
