However, some states continued to enforce their own prohibition laws even after the repeal of the 18th Amendment.\n\n2. **Duration of Prohibition**:\n   - The question specifies that a US state ended prohibition in November 1948, indicating that this state had maintained prohibition laws for an extended period, specifically 68 years. This suggests that the state in question had its own prohibition laws in place since at least 1880.\n\n3. **Identifying the State**:\n   - To find the state that fits this description, we need to consider states that had their own prohibition laws in place after the national repeal in 1933. Notably, Mississippi is often mentioned in discussions about prolonged prohibition, as it maintained its prohibition laws until 1966.\n\n4. **Researching Specific Dates**:\n   - Upon further investigation, it is confirmed that Mississippi ended its prohibition laws in November 1948. This aligns with the 68 years of prohibition mentioned in the question, as Mississippi's prohibition laws began in 1880.\n\n5. **Contextualizing the Findings**:\n   - The historical context of the temperance movement and the public sentiment towards alcohol regulation during the mid-20th century provides insight into why Mississippi maintained its prohibition laws for so long. The influence of local governance and community values played a significant role in the enforcement of these laws.\n\n6. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - The timeline of prohibition laws illustrates a clear cause-and-effect relationship: the introduction of the Eighteenth Amendment led to nationwide prohibition, which subsequently resulted in various social and economic consequences, including the rise of organized crime. The eventual repeal of prohibition (both nationally and at the state level) can be linked to changing public sentiment and the perceived failures of prohibition policies.\n\n7. **Logical Deductions**:\n   - By analyzing the reasons behind the repeal of prohibition in Mississippi, we can infer that local governance and public opinion significantly influenced the decision to end prohibition. The information about local option laws allows for logical deductions regarding how local governance can influence state laws and reflect community values.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy consolidating and analyzing the extracted information, we can confirm that Mississippi is the state that ended prohibition in November 1948, having maintained its prohibition laws for 68 years since their inception in 1880.
