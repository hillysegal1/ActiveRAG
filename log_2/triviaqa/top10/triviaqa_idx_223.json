This duality suggests that while owls can be linked to bad luck, they are not universally perceived that way, making them less definitive as a source of bad luck compared to crows.\n\n3. **Hoopoes**: \n   - Hoopoes have a mixed reputation, being considered sacred in some cultures and thieves in others. There is no direct mention of hoopoes being associated with bad luck, which diminishes their relevance to the question.\n\n4. **Peacocks**: \n   - Peacocks are not directly associated with bad luck in the passages.
