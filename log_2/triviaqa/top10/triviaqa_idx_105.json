Of course, alcohol was not considered an indulgence in those days, but rather a necessity, since it was erroneously believed that it warded off diseases like malaria, which it was claimed came from exposure to 'miasmas'.\n", "Alcohol distillation likely originated in India. During 2000 BCE, people of India used an alcoholic drink called \"Sura\". Alcohol distillation was known to Islamic chemists as early as the eighth century. \n", "The drink originated during The Moorish Occupation of Spain, when the Moors brought distilling technology to the peninsula.\n", "Saxon chronicles before their conquest of the Britons mention cider-like drinks and also mention the production of a drink called \"\u00e6ppelw\u012bn\", an ancient cognate of the Modern German \u2019apfelwein\u2019\u2019, both literally meaning a wine or alcohol made from apples. Though it is unknown if there is any relation between the ancient drink and the modern German product, at least one account indicates the drink was a luxury item that only the wealthy could afford. There is also evidence from the mid-late Anglo-Saxon period of the growth of orchards before, during, and after Christianisation of this group and their ceremonial use, most famously the custom of Wassail at Yuletide, and it is known that monks grew apples in their gardens.\n", "The drink originated in 1973 when Tilburgian entrepreneur Jan Wassing started experimenting with a drink with lower alcoholic percentage that was appropriate for his stomach. The result was successful. The drink is distilled now at Loven industrial area in Tilburg by the Eindhoven company Schrobbeler Ltd, without the \u00e8 on the last vowel. The drink is especially consumed at Carnival. The name is derived from the profession of 'Schrobbelaar', in the textile industry in Tilburg. The profession was unskilled and had a low wage.\n", "According to the Scotch Whisky Association, Scotch whisky evolved from a Scottish drink called \"uisge beatha\", which means \"water of life\". The earliest record of distillation in Scotland occurred as long ago as 1494, as documented in the \"Exchequer Rolls\", which were records of royal income and expenditure. The quote above records eight bolls of malt given to Friar John Cor wherewith to make aqua vitae (Latin for \"water of life,\" = \"uisge beatha\") over the previous year. This would be enough for 1,500 bottles, which suggests that distillation was well-established by the late 15th century.\n", "Distilled spirit was generally flavored with juniper berries. The resulting beverage was known as jenever, the Dutch word for \"juniper.\" The French changed the name to genievre, which the English changed to \"geneva\" and then modified to \"gin.\" Originally used for medicinal purposes, the use of gin as a social drink did not grow rapidly at first. However, in 1690, England passed \"An Act for the Encouraging of the Distillation of Brandy and Spirits from Corn\" and within four years the annual production of distilled spirits, most of which was gin, reached nearly one million gallons. \"Corn\" in the British English of the time meant \"grain\" in general, while in American English \"corn\" refers principally to maize.\n"], "__answers__": ["Vodka", "Wodka (disambiguation)", "Balkan 176\u00b0", "balkan 176deg", "vodka", "vodak", "Wodka", "Vodka and Coke", "Vokda", "blackcurrant vodka", "filtering vodka", "\u0412\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0430", "Vodak", "Filtering vodka", "balkan 176\u00b0", "Blackcurrant vodka", "vokda", "vodka and coke", "Russian vodka", "Balkan 176deg", "russian vodka", "wodka", "wodka disambiguation", "\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0430"]}}
