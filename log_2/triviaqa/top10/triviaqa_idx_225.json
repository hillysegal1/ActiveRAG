The concept of a group of people living together in a house, monitored by cameras, is a hallmark of the 'Big Brother' format. This show, which originated in the Netherlands, introduced a competitive element to the reality genre, influencing numerous adaptations worldwide.

The third series of the UK version of \"Big Brother\"\u2014which was showing while Russian's con took place\u2014attracted audience figures of approximately 5.8\u00a0million. Most British reality TV programmes at the time centred on a team of people trying to accomplish a specific goal or target. For example, the 2000 series \"Jailbreak\" challenged a group to escape from a mock prison, while the 2001 series \"The Mole\" gave the contestants the task of discovering which of them was sabotaging their attempts to win money. Most reality TV shows offered a cash reward to successful participants\u2014both \"Jailbreak\" and the first series of \"The Mole\" offered a prize of \u00a3100,000.\n", "The series \"Expedition Robinson\", created by television producer Charlie Parsons, which first aired in 1997 in Sweden (and was later produced in a large number of other countries as \"Survivor\"), added to the \"Nummer 28\"/\"Real World\" template the idea of competition and elimination. Cast members/contestants battled against each other and were removed from the show until only one winner remained (these shows are now sometimes called elimination shows). \"Changing Rooms\", a program that began in 1996, showed couples redecorating each other's houses, and was the first reality show with a self-improvement or makeover theme. The dating reality show \"Streetmate\" premiered in the UK in 1998. Originally created by Gabe Sachs as \"Street Match\", it was a flop in the United States. But the show was revamped in the UK by Tiger Aspect Productions and became a cult hit. The production team from the original series later created the popular reality shows \"Strictly Come Dancing\", \"Location, Location, Location\", and the revamped \"MasterChef\", among others. The 1980s and 1990s were also a time when tabloid talk shows became more popular. Many of these featured the same types of unusual or dysfunctional guests who would later become popular as cast members of reality shows.\n", "The Val\u00f3 Vil\u00e1g (Real World) is Hungary's reality show aired by RTL Klub.

The program created viewer storms, debates and was reported to Swedish Broadcasting Commission several times. Six episodes were made but only four aired. The concept involved Filip and Fredrik making fun of both famous and unknown people using a hidden camera and similar setups. The show was largely influenced by shows like \"Pyjamas\", a similar show that aired the year before on youth channel ZTV. The jokes were of a rather unusual, sometimes experimental, nature and some viewers took offense, feeling that the pair were humiliating innocent people. Often the \"jokes\" were taken far beyond what in most people produced a laugh. The show made headlines due to a segment called \"the Swedish Nazi-reference championship\" where they fooled singer and former Expedition Robinson-star Emma Andersson into an interview where they made as many Nazi-references as possible and observed her reactions. Due to that segment, TV4 was fined by the Swedish Broadcasting Commission who argued that, since Emma was not a political person, the segment was intrusive to her privacy and integrity. Fredrik has later said that \"Urs\u00e4kta r\u00f6ran (vi bygger om)\" was an order from TV4 because they wanted a show that 90% hated and 10% liked.\n", "Precedents for television that portrayed people in unscripted situations began in the late 1940s. \"Queen for a Day\" (1945\u20131964) was an early example of reality-based television.

Debuting in 1948, Allen Funt's hidden camera show, \"Candid Camera\" (based on his previous 1947 radio show, \"Candid Microphone\"), broadcast unsuspecting ordinary people reacting to pranks. In 1948, talent search shows, such as \"Ted Mack's Original Amateur Hour\" and \"Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts\", featured amateur competitors and audience voting. In the 1950s, game shows \"Beat the Clock\" and \"Truth or Consequences\" involved contestants in wacky competitions, stunts, and practical jokes. \"Confession\" was a crime/police show that aired from June 1958 to January 1959, with interviewer Jack Wyatt questioning criminals from assorted backgrounds. The radio series \"Nightwatch\" (1951\u20131955) tape-recorded the daily activities of Culver City, California police officers. The series \"You Asked for It\" (1950\u20131959) incorporated audience involvement by basing episodes around requests sent in by postcard from viewers. \"You're Another\", a science fiction short story by American writer Damon Knight, was first published in the June 1955 issue of \"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\". It has perhaps the earliest fictional depiction of what is now called reality television.\n", "The Real World: Visby was a Swedish and Norwegian reality television program that was broadcast on TV1000 in late 1996.
