They reference the passage that mentions hillside letters in Utah, which showcases the cultural identity tied to the state. The historian notes that Utah's name is derived from the Ute tribe, which adds a layer of historical context to the state's identity.\n\n**Expert 2: Linguist**\nThe linguist contributes by discussing the phonetic and linguistic aspects of the letter 'U'. They highlight that 'U' is the 21st letter of the alphabet and its role as a vowel. While this information is foundational, it does not directly relate to the question at hand. However, the linguist points out that understanding the structure of language can help in recognizing patterns in state names, reinforcing the uniqueness of Utah.\n\n**Expert 3: Geographer**\nThe geographer focuses on the geographical aspects of Utah, discussing its location and natural features. They mention that Utah is known for its diverse landscapes, including mountains and deserts, which contribute to its identity. The geographer agrees with the historian that Utah is the only state starting with 'U' and emphasizes how geography can influence cultural and historical narratives.\n\n**Expert 4: Cultural Anthropologist**\nThe cultural anthropologist brings in the cultural significance of Utah, particularly its connection to the Mormon community and its unique traditions.
