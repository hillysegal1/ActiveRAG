The key agreement that fits this description is the **Schengen Agreement**, which was signed in 1985. This agreement marked a significant step towards European integration by allowing for the free movement of people across borders without the need for passport checks among its member states.\n\n1. **Historical Context**: The Schengen Agreement was initially signed by five countries (Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany) and has since expanded to include 22 EU member states and 4 non-EU states (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland). This expansion illustrates the agreement's role in promoting cooperation and unity in Europe.\n\n2. **Free Movement**: The Schengen Area facilitates passport-free travel, which is a cornerstone of the agreement. This allows citizens to move freely between member states, significantly reducing bureaucratic barriers and enhancing trade and tourism.\n\n3. **Comparative Agreements**: While the Schengen Agreement is the primary framework for abolishing passport controls in Europe, it is important to note the existence of the **Nordic Passport Union**, which predates Schengen and allows for similar freedoms among Nordic countries (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland). However, the Schengen Agreement encompasses a broader range of countries and is more significant in terms of its impact on European integration.\n\n4. **Opt-Outs**: The complexities of the Schengen framework are highlighted by the opt-outs of certain countries, such as Ireland and the United Kingdom, which maintain their own border control policies through the Common Travel Area (CTA). This illustrates that not all EU member states participate in the Schengen Agreement, which can affect the overall dynamics of border control in Europe.\n\n5. **Legal Framework**: The Schengen \"acquis\" refers to the body of laws and regulations governing the Schengen Area, which has been integrated into EU law. This legal framework outlines the rules for border control, visa policies, and cooperation among member states, further emphasizing the importance of the Schengen Agreement in European governance.\n\nBy synthesizing this information, we can conclude that the Schengen Agreement is the key framework that abolished passport controls among its member states, facilitating free movement across borders.\n\n### Answer:\nSchengen Agreement"}], "associate": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are part of a panel of experts engaged in a collaborative discussion to address the following question:\nWhat is the name of the agreement under which passport controls have been abolished in 22 EU and 4 non-EU states?\n\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The Nordic Passport Union was established in three stages.

This historical context is crucial as it establishes the origins of the agreement and its purpose.\n\n2. **Expansion of Membership**:\n   - Over time, the Schengen Area has expanded to include 22 of the 28 EU member states and four EFTA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland). This expansion illustrates the agreement's success in promoting free movement across a significant portion of Europe.\n\n3. **Mechanics of Free Movement**:\n   - The Schengen Agreement allows for passport-free travel among member states, effectively removing internal border checks. This aspect is vital for understanding the practical implications of the agreement on citizens' mobility.\n\n4. **Temporary Measures and External Influences**:\n   - The agreement has faced challenges, such as the temporary re-imposition of border controls during crises (e.g., the migrant crisis in 2015). This highlights how external factors can impact established agreements, which is important for understanding the dynamic nature of international relations.\n\n5. **Comparison with Other Agreements**:\n   - While the Nordic Passport Union also facilitates free movement among Nordic countries, it is distinct from the Schengen Agreement. This comparison helps clarify the specific scope and limitations of the Schengen Area versus other agreements.\n\n6. **Legal Framework**:\n   - The Schengen \"acquis\" comprises the laws and regulations governing the Schengen Area, which have been integrated into EU law. Understanding this legal framework is essential for grasping how international agreements can influence domestic legislation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe Schengen Agreement is a pivotal framework that has transformed border control policies in Europe, allowing for significant freedom of movement among its member states. By analyzing its historical context, membership expansion, practical implications, and legal framework, we can enhance our understanding of the causal relationships and dynamics involved.\n\n### Answer:\nThe agreement under which passport controls have been abolished in 22 EU and 4 non-EU states is the **Schengen Agreement**."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nWhat is the name of the agreement under which passport controls have been abolished in 22 EU and 4 non-EU states?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The Nordic Passport Union was established in three stages.

However, citizens of the Nordic Passport Union countries enjoy extra rights within the Nordic area, not available under Schengen, such as less paperwork if moving to a different Nordic country, and fewer requirements for naturalization or citizenship. Within the Nordic area, any Nordic identity documentation (e.g. a driving license) is valid as proof of identity for Nordic citizens because of the Nordic Passport Union, while a national identity card or a passport can be required in other Schengen countries.
