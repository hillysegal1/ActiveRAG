He was buried on the grounds of the Palapala Ho'omau Church in Kipahulu.

His epitaph reflects his deep connection to nature and the sea, which were integral to his life.\n\n**Expert 2: Cultural Anthropologist**\nI agree with the historian's assessment of Lindbergh's burial site. The choice of Palapala Ho'omau Church is particularly interesting from a cultural perspective. It symbolizes a return to simplicity and a connection to the land, which contrasts sharply with the fame and tumult of his earlier life.
