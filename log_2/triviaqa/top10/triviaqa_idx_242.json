Algeria's Mediterranean coastline has historically facilitated trade and cultural exchange, further solidifying its importance.\n\n6. **Political and Ecological Considerations**: The political scientist's emphasis on the geopolitical landscape and the environmental scientist's focus on ecological diversity highlight the broader implications of Algeria's geography. Algeria's Mediterranean coast contrasts with the arid landscapes of other countries like Mauritania, which do not share this coastal feature.\n\n7. **Consolidating Perspectives**: The points of agreement among the experts reinforce the understanding that while Mauritania is significant, it does not meet the criteria of the question. The disagreement about Mauritania's classification as a Mediterranean country is resolved by recognizing that it does not have a Mediterranean coastline.\n\n**Answer:**\nAlgeria is the country in North Africa that is bordered by Tunisia, Libya, Niger, Mali, Mauritania, Western Sahara, Morocco, and the Mediterranean Sea.

In the 1st millennium AD, the Sahara became an equally important area for trade as camel caravans brought goods and people from the south. The region also has a small but crucial land link to the Middle East, and that area has also played a key role in the history of North Africa.\n", "Mauritania \u2013 sovereign country located in West Africa. Mauritania is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean on the west, by Senegal on the southwest, by Mali on the east and southeast, by Algeria on the northeast, and by the Morocco-controlled Western Sahara on the northwest. It is named after the ancient Berber kingdom of Mauretania. The capital and largest city is Nouakchott, located on the Atlantic coast.\n", "The geography of Morocco spans from the Atlantic Ocean, to mountainous areas, to the Sahara desert. Morocco is a Northern African country, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, between Algeria and the annexed Western Sahara. It is one of only three nations (along with Spain and France) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.\n", "Mauritania, a country in the western region of the continent of Africa, is generally flat, its 1,030,700 square kilometres forming vast, arid plains broken by occasional ridges and clifflike outcroppings. It borders the North Atlantic Ocean, between Senegal and Western Sahara, Mali and Algeria. It is considered part of both the Sahel and the Maghreb. A series of scarps face southwest, longitudinally bisecting these plains in the center of the country. The scarps also separate a series of sandstone plateaus, the highest of which is the Adrar Plateau, reaching an elevation of 500 metres. Spring-fed oases lie at the foot of some of the scarps. Isolated peaks, often rich in minerals, rise above the plateaus; the smaller peaks are called guelbs and the larger ones kedias. The concentric Guelb er Richat is a prominent feature of the north-central region. Kediet ej Jill, near the city of Zou\u00eer\u00e2t, has an elevation of 1,000 metres and is the highest peak.\n", "In the west, it is bounded by the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. From northeast to southwest, Morocco, Western Sahara (mostly unilaterally annexed by Morocco), and Mauritania make up the roughly 2,000 kilometers of Arab Atlantic coastline. The southwestern sweep of the coast is gentle but substantial, such that Mauritania's capital, Nouakchott (18\u00b0N, 16\u00b0W), is far enough west to share longitude with Iceland (13\u201322\u00b0W). Nouakchott is the westernmost capital of the Arab World and the third-westernmost in Africa, and sits on the Atlantic fringe of the southwestern Sahara. Next south along the coast from Mauritania is Senegal, whose abrupt border belies the gradient in culture from Arab to indigenous African that historically characterizes this part of West Africa.\n", "Tunisia is a country in Northern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, having a western border with Algeria (965\u00a0km) and south-eastern border with Libya (459\u00a0km) where the width of land tapers to the south-west into the Sahara. The country has north, east and complex east-to-north coasts including the curved Gulf of Gab\u00e8s, which forms the western part of Africa's Gulf of Sidra. Most of this greater gulf forms the main coast of Libya including the city of Sirte which shares its root name. The country's geographic coordinates are . Tunisia occupies an area of 163,610 square kilometres, of which 8,250 are water. The principal and reliable rivers rise in the north of the country with a few notable exceptions from north-east Algeria and flow through the northern plain where sufficient rainfall supports diverse plant cover and irrigated agriculture.\n", "Tunisia \u2013 northernmost country in Africa situated on the southern coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Tunisia is the smallest of the nations situated along the Atlas mountain range. The south of the country is composed of the Sahara desert, with much of the remainder consisting of particularly fertile soil and of coastline. In ancient times, Tunisia was the home of the famous Phoenician city of Carthage.\n"], "__answers__": ["Popular Democratic Republic of Algeria", "Algerian People's Democratic Republic", "Algeria", "Algeria", "Algeria", "Algeria", "Algeria", "Algeria", "Algeria", "Algeria", "Algeria", "Algeria", "Algeria", "Dzayer", "People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Algeria", "Republic of Algeria", "People's Republic of Algeria", "People's Democratic Republic of Algeria", "\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631", "r\u00e9publique alg\u00e9rienne d\u00e9mocratique et populaire", "dzayer", "Al-Jumhuriyah al-Jaza'iriyah", "algerie", "Name of Algeria", "algeria country", "Ad-Dimuqratiyah ash-Sha'biyah", "AlgeriA", "al jumhuriyah al jaza iriyah", "Subdivisions of Algeria", "People's Democratic Algerian Republic", "algerian peoples democratic republic", "subdivision of algeria", "subdivisions of algeria", "Etymology of Algeria", "Administrative divisions of Algeria", "ad d\u012bmuqr\u0101\u1e6d\u012byah ash sha b\u012byah", "Algerian Peoples Democratic Republic", "algerian people s democratic republic", "name of algeria", "etymology of algeria", "republic of algeria", "Algery", "people s democratic republic of algeria", "people s republic of algeria", "algerian state", "Algerian State", "algery", "people s democratic algerian republic", "\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0645\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0637\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0628\u064a\u0629", "ISO 3166-1:DZ", "iso 3166 1 dz", "Algeria country", "Subdivision of Algeria", "al jumhuriyah al jaza iriyah ad dimuqratiyah ash shabiyah", "Alg\u00e9rie", "al jumh\u016br\u012byah al jaz\u0101 ir\u012byah", "R\u00e9publique alg\u00e9rienne d\u00e9mocratique et populaire", "Al-Jumh\u016br\u012byah al-Jaz\u0101\u2019ir\u012byah", "Ad-D\u012bmuqr\u0101\u1e6d\u012byah ash-Sha\u2019b\u012byah", "alg\u00e9rie", "administrative divisions of algeria", "popular democratic republic of algeria", "algeria", "Al Jumhuriyah al Jaza'iriyah ad Dimuqratiyah ash Shabiyah", "ad dimuqratiyah ash sha biyah", "Algerie"]}}
