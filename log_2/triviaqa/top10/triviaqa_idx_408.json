Expert 1 emphasizes the historical significance of Budge's accomplishment, highlighting its impact on the sport.\n\nExpert 2 adds depth by noting that Budge's dominance was not only evident in his Grand Slam win but also in his six consecutive major titles in 1937 and 1938. This context illustrates the competitive landscape of the era, where players like Jack Crawford came close to achieving the Grand Slam but ultimately fell short.\n\nExpert 3 provides a comparative perspective by drawing parallels between Budge's achievement and that of Bobby Jones in golf, who won all four major championships in 1930. This comparison underscores the unique challenges of achieving a Grand Slam in tennis, given the different surfaces and conditions of each tournament.\n\nExpert 4 contextualizes Budge's achievement within modern tennis, noting how the physical demands of the game have evolved. This perspective highlights the enduring difficulty of achieving a Grand Slam, as it took nearly three decades for another player, Rod Laver, to replicate the feat.\n\nIn summary, the discussion reveals a comprehensive understanding of Don Budge's achievement as the first player to win all four Grand Slam titles in 1938. The insights from the experts collectively enhance our appreciation of this milestone by considering the competitive context, the significance of the achievement in relation to other sports, and the evolution of tennis.\n\n**Answer:**\nDon Budge was the first player to win all four tennis Grand Slam titles in a single calendar year, achieving this remarkable feat in 1938."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nIn the 1930s, who was the first to win all 4 tennis Grand Slam titles?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n[\"Jones is the only player ever to have won the (pre-Masters) Grand Slam, or all four major championships, in the same calendar year (1930).

Tiger Woods is the only professional golfer to win four consecutive professional majors; he did so over two years in 2000 and 2001.

By a large margin, an Associated Press poll in 1950 named Bill Tilden as the greatest player of the first half of the 20th century. From 1920 to 1930, Tilden won singles titles at Wimbledon three times and the U.S. Championships seven times. In 1938, however, Donald Budge became the first person to win all four major singles titles during the same calendar year, the Grand Slam, and won six consecutive major titles in 1937 and 1938. Tilden called Budge \"the finest player 365 days a year that ever lived.\" In his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer said that, based on consistent play, Budge was the greatest player ever. Some observers, however, also felt that Kramer deserved consideration for the title. Kramer was among the few who dominated amateur and professional tennis during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Tony Trabert has said that of the players he saw before the start of the open era, Kramer was the best male champion.\\n', 'This was the second Grand Slam final the two played, and the first time the two had met at Flushing Meadows.

Murray claimed the first two sets, the first in a 24-minute tiebreak, and the second by 7 games to 5 after being 4\u20130 up at one point, before Djokovic levelled the scoring to take the match into a deciding fifth set, in which Murray regained his prior momentum and emerged victorious. This match equals the record set by Ivan Lendl and Mats Wilander as the longest US Open final in history, as well as the second longest major final in the Open Era, behind the 2012 Australian Open final (which also featured Djokovic).

Nadal eventually emerged victorious after 3 consecutive losses in Grand Slam finals, prevailing in 4 sets after multiple rain delays that forced the final to be concluded on the following Monday afternoon.

The only time the Grand Slam has been swept in any given year was 1930, when Bobby Jones won all four majors (at the time, The (British) Amateur Championship and U.S. Amateur were still considered majors); since 1934, when The Masters was added as a major, no player has won all four in one year. Tiger Woods is the only professional golfer to win four consecutive professional majors; he did so over two years in 2000 and 2001. The record for most consecutive wins in professional golf is 11, set Byron Nelson in 1945; Nelson would win 18 tournaments overall that year, a year when wartime manpower shortages were still limiting the number and quality of professional golfers for Nelson to compete against.\n", "Novak Djokovic had the chance to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four Grand Slam titles at once, having won the previous year's Wimbledon and US Open titles as well as that year's Australian Open (all wins against Nadal), but lost the final to Rafael Nadal. It was Djokovic's 4th consecutive loss to Nadal at Roland Garros, but it was the first time that Djokovic would take a set from Nadal at the Parisian grand slam. Djokovic would achieve this feat 4 years later at the 2015 French Open.\n", "Pete Sampras had the chance to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four Grand Slam tournaments at once, having won the previous year's Wimbledon, U.S. Open and this year's Australian Open titles. He lost to Jim Courier in the quarterfinals. This feat would not be achieved by any man until Novak Djokovic did so in the 2016 French Open.\n", "A frequent topic of discussion among tennis fans and commentators is who was the greatest male singles player of all time. By a large margin, an Associated Press poll in 1950 named Bill Tilden as the greatest player of the first half of the 20th century. From 1920 to 1930, Tilden won singles titles at Wimbledon three times and the U.S. Championships seven times. In 1938, however, Donald Budge became the first person to win all four major singles titles during the same calendar year, the Grand Slam, and won six consecutive major titles in 1937 and 1938. Tilden called Budge \"the finest player 365 days a year that ever lived.\" In his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer said that, based on consistent play, Budge was the greatest player ever. Some observers, however, also felt that Kramer deserved consideration for the title. Kramer was among the few who dominated amateur and professional tennis during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Tony Trabert has said that of the players he saw before the start of the open era, Kramer was the best male champion.\n", "This was the second Grand Slam final the two played, and the first time the two had met at Flushing Meadows. After a 4-hour, 54 minute long final, Murray defeated Djokovic to claim his first ever major title, making him the first British man to win a Grand Slam title since Fred Perry in 1936. Murray claimed the first two sets, the first in a 24-minute tiebreak, and the second by 7 games to 5 after being 4\u20130 up at one point, before Djokovic levelled the scoring to take the match into a deciding fifth set, in which Murray regained his prior momentum and emerged victorious. This match equals the record set by Ivan Lendl and Mats Wilander as the longest US Open final in history, as well as the second longest major final in the Open Era, behind the 2012 Australian Open final (which also featured Djokovic). It also featured the longest ever tie-break in a US Open final, with a 12\u201310 final score in the first set.\n", "The fourth battle of the year came at the 2012 French Open final. For the second time in tennis history, two opposing tennis players played four consecutive Grand Slams finals against each other. This was a match of historic proportions as either Nadal would have broken Bj\u00f6rn Borg's record of six titles at the French Open or Djokovic would have become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win four Grand Slams in a row. Nadal eventually emerged victorious after 3 consecutive losses in Grand Slam finals, prevailing in 4 sets after multiple rain delays that forced the final to be concluded on the following Monday afternoon. With this victory, Nadal became the most successful tennis player at the French Open, winning seven French Open titles.\n", "Pete Sampras successfully defended his title for the fourth consecutive year, defeating Pat Rafter in the final, 6\u20137, 7\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20132 to win the Gentlemen's Singles tennis title at the 2000 Wimbledon Championships. Sampras' 7th Wimbledon title equalled William Renshaw's record, and was an Open Era record in the Gentleman's Singles until 2017, when Roger Federer won his 8th title. His victory was his 13th Grand Slam title, surpassing Roy Emerson as the overall leader in Grand Slam singles titles. This was to be Sampras' last Wimbledon title. \n"], "__answers__": ["Fred Perry", "Fred J. Perry", "frederick john perry", "fred perry", "fred j perry", "Frederick John Perry"]}}
