In the Bible, Peter is one of the first disciples that Jesus calls upon. In the Book of Matthew, Jesus said to Peter, \u201cAnd I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.\" El Greco included the keys of heaven in this painting, as seen in the left hand of Peter. \n", "Paul the Apostle says that Peter had the special charge of being apostle to the Jews, just as he was apostle to the Gentiles. Another apostle, James, is regarded as the leader of the Jewish Christians.\n"], "__answers__": ["Fisherman", "fishergirl", "fisher girls", "Fisher girls", "fisherwoman", "Fisherwoman", "fishergirls", "Fisher girl", "Fishergirl", "fisher girl", "Fishermen", "fishermen", "fisherman", "Fishergirls"]}}
