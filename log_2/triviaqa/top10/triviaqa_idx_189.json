This model exemplifies the principles of democratic member control and concern for community.\n\n5. **Housing Cooperatives**: Residential communities owned and managed by residents allow members to participate in governance and share the benefits of living in a community-oriented environment. This model reflects the principles of equity and solidarity.\n\nThe expert panel discussion adds depth to our understanding of these cooperative forms. The historian emphasizes the historical context of the Rochdale Principles as a response to economic hardship, while the cooperative economics scholar points out their adaptability across various sectors. The social entrepreneur highlights the importance of community welfare and employee empowerment, which are critical for the social impact of cooperatives. The policy analyst raises valid concerns about the challenges cooperatives face in scaling and competing in the market, suggesting that supportive policies are essential for their growth. Finally, the sustainability advocate connects the principles to contemporary environmental concerns, illustrating how cooperatives can contribute to a sustainable economy.\n\n**Answer:**\nBusinesses that operate on the basis of the Rochdale Principles include consumer cooperatives, worker cooperatives, agricultural cooperatives, credit unions, and housing cooperatives. These businesses not only aim for economic success but also prioritize social responsibility, community welfare, and sustainability. The diverse perspectives from the expert panel enrich our understanding of how these principles can be applied in various contexts, highlighting both the potential and challenges of cooperative enterprises in today's economy.

The implications of the Rochdale Principles are a focus of study in co-operative economics. The original Rochdale Principles were officially adopted by the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) in 1937 as the Rochdale Principles of Co-operation. Updated versions of the principles were adopted by the ICA in 1966 as the Co-operative Principles and in 1995 as part of the Statement on the Co-operative Identity.\n", "The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers was a group of 10 weavers and 20 others in Rochdale, England, that was formed in 1844. As the mechanization of the Industrial Revolution was forcing more and more skilled workers into poverty, these tradesmen decided to band together to open their own store selling food items they could not otherwise afford. With lessons from prior failed attempts at co-operation in mind, they designed the now famous Rochdale Principles, and over a period of four months they struggled to pool one pound sterling per person for a total of 28 pounds of capital. On December 21, 1844, they opened their store with a very meagre selection of butter, sugar, flour, oatmeal and a few candles. Within three months, they expanded their selection to include tea and tobacco, and they were soon known for providing high quality, unadulterated goods.\n", "BULLET::::- 1844: The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers founded in Lancashire. The Rochdale Principles are the foundation for the co-operative principles on which co-ops around the world operate to this day.\n", "The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers was a group of 28 that was formed in 1844.

The Rochdale Pioneers are most famous for designing the Rochdale Principles, a set of principles of co-operation that provide the foundation for the principles on which co-ops around the world operate to this day. The model the Rochdale Pioneers used is a focus of study within co-operative economics.\n", "The first successful organization was the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, established in England in 1844.
