This enriched knowledge allows for more nuanced interpretations of heraldic symbols and their implications in social structures.\n\n### Answer:\nA 'mullet' on a coat of arms is a heraldic symbol that resembles a star with straight arms, typically featuring five points. It signifies knightly rank and is traditionally used in British heraldry as a mark of cadency for the third son. The presence of a mullet can represent honor, achievement, and familial hierarchy, indicating the rank or birth order of an individual within a family."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nWhat is a \u2018mullet\u2019 on a coat of arms?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['BULLET::::- In heraldry, a mullet is a star with straight arms and typically five points.
