Given his established role as a fly-half, it is logical to conclude that he would have worn the number 10 jersey.\n\n4. **Absence of Specific Information**: The passages provided do not contain explicit details about the 2011 World Cup shirt number. However, the absence of this information does not negate the established conventions of rugby shirt numbering, which can be relied upon for logical inference.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the established conventions of rugby shirt numbering, Jonny Wilkinson, as a fly-half, would have worn the number 10 jersey during the 2011 Rugby World Cup. This inference is supported by his historical role and position in the sport.\n\n### Answer:\n10"}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nWhat number shirt did England rugby union player Jonny Wilkinson wear in the 2011 World Cup?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['Jonathan Peter Wilkinson, CBE (born 25 May 1979) is an English former rugby union player.
