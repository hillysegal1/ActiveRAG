Each mode of persuasion can be inventional, helping an orator create an effective argument.\n", "In \"Rhetoric\", Aristotle identifies three artistic modes of persuasion, one of which is \"awakening emotion (pathos) in the audience so as to induce them to make the judgment desired.\" In the first chapter, he includes the way in which \"men change their opinion in regard to their judgment. As such, emotions have specific causes and effects\" (Book 2.1.2\u20133). Aristotle identifies pathos as one of the three essential modes of proof by his statement that \"to understand the emotions\u2014that is, to name them and describe them, to know their causes and the way in which they are excited (1356a24\u20131356a25). Aristotle posits that, alongside pathos, the speaker must also deploy good ethos in order to establish credibility (Book 2.1.5\u20139).\n", "In the early 1990s Peter Senge developed new theories on organizational communication. These theories were learning organization and systems thinking. These have been well received and are now a mainstay in current beliefs toward organizational communications.\n", "The concept was developed by sociologist John Brookshire Thompson, a professor at the University of Cambridge and a fellow of Jesus College. The concept is first documented in his book \u201cThe Rise of Mediated Interaction\u201d, which was published in 1995 in Cambridge, UK. Thompson developed a conceptual framework for the analysis of the forms of action and interaction created by the media. He wanted to focus the types of interactional situation created by the mass media. He also wanted the analytical framework to examine some of the interactional features of the social relationships established by the media.\n", "The approach has a similar structure to Aristotle's concept of persuasion in his \"Rhetoric\". According to Aristotle, there are three means of persuasion: the character of the speaker, the emotional state of the listener and \"logos\" (the argument itself). Contemporary psychologists use the Yale model's psychological approach and Aristotle's philosophical approach to examine components of persuasion.\n", "Self-Persuasion came about based on the more traditional or direct strategies of persuasion, which have been around for at least 2,300 years and studied by eminent social psychologists from Aristotle to Carl Hovland, that focused their attention on these three principal factors: the nature of the message, the characteristics of the communicator, and the characteristics of the audience. It wasn't until later that the theory of self-persuasion was developed by Dr. Carl Hovland, of Psychology, who had conducted studies during his time at Yale University during the 1940s and '50s. His argument in creating the concept of self-persuasion was that the factors within us determine our decision making; for example, one's own personality, self-esteem, education, or interest.\n", "Developed by Rogers and Shoemaker, the communication of innovations theory explains how innovations come to be adopted by communities and what factors influence the rate of adoption. These factors include the characteristics of those who adopt the innovation, the nature of the social system, the characteristics of the innovation and the characteristics of change agents. Rogers and Shoemaker argue that all innovations follow a similar pattern of adoption, with one group of people\u2014the \"innovators\"\u2014taking it up immediately. Then there are \"early adopters\", the \"early majority\", the \"late majority\" and finally the \"laggards\", including some who never adopt the innovation. In this theory key people influence the opinion leaders within a community. Change agents can be viewed as health professionals while opinion leaders correlate with peer educators. Rogers and Shoemaker argue that effective communication occurs when the source and receiver are \"homophilous\", that is, are similar in certain attributes. These include beliefs, values, education and social status. This would suggest that peers communicate better than those who are unequal or different.\n", "Hovland, Janis, and Kelly published the group's first empirical findings under the publication \"Communication and Persuasion (1953)\"\".\" They paralleled their research to Laswell's (1948) statement; \"who says what to whom with what effect\" \".\" In the publication they categorized their findings on the analysis of four factors: \"1) the communicator who transmits the communication; 2) the stimuli transmitted by the communicator; 3) the audience responding to the communication; 4) the responses made by the audience to the communication\". The Yale School had a breakdown of sub-factors that they observed for each topic (The Communicator, The Communication, The Audience). \u00a0The fourth topic, which they deemed \"Responses\" was composed of two subtopics which explored the \"expression of the new opinion\" and \"retention of the opinion change\". \u00a0The Yale group had a total of five publications reporting the findings of their experiments (including Communication and Persuasion) under the same model, they were: \"The Order of Presentation in Persuasion, Personality and Persuasibility, Attitude Organization and Change, and Social Judgement\" that further explored each factor.\n", "Terhardt\u2019s approach to acoustic communication is based on Karl Popper\u2019s theory of three worlds according to which reality is either physical, experiential (perception, sensations, emotions) or abstract (thoughts, knowledge, information, culture). Terhardt maintains that these three aspects of acoustic communication must be carefully separated before we empirically explore the relationships between them. In the physical world, we consider the physics of sound sources such as the voice and musical instruments; auditory environments including reflectors; electroacoustic systems such as microphones and loudspeakers; and the ear and brain, considered as a purely physical system. Sound is a signal that is that is analysed by the ear; to understand this process, we need foundations of signal processing. To understand auditory perception, we perform psychoacoustic experiments, which are generally about relationships between and among Popper\u2019s three worlds.\n", "The emotional thought method was created by Carlos Hu\u00e9, a Spanish psychologist who is a teacher in the University of Zaragoza. This method is explained in the book \"Pensamiento emocional. Un m\u00e9todo para el desarrollo de la autoestima y el liderazgo\" (Hu\u00e9, 2007). Unfortunately, this book has not yet been translated into English. Carlos Hu\u00e9 gathers a lot of exercises in this method in order to develop emotional skills.\n"], "__answers__": ["Aristotle's", "Aristotle's", "Aristotle's", "Aristotle", "Aristotle", "Aristotle", "aristoteles", "aristotele", "aristotelo", "Aristotel", "Aristotle of Stagira", "Aristotole", "aristotole", "\u0391\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2", "Aristoteles", "artisole", "MrAristotle", "It is the mark of", "aristotle of stagira", "arystoteles", "aristotel", "Aristole", "Aristotelean philosophy", "artistotle", "Aristotelo", "Artisole", "Aristotele", "aristotle s", "aristotelean philosophy", "philosophy of aristotle", "Stagirite", "aristotles theories", "aristotle", "aristole", "\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2", "Philosophy of Aristotle", "Aristotles theories", "Aristotles", "aristutalis", "stagirite", "stagyrite", "mraristotle", "The Stagyrite", "The Stagirite", "Arystoteles", "Aristotelis", "aristotelis", "Aristutalis", "it is mark of", "aristotles", "Artistotle"]}}
