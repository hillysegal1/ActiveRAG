However, they did not find recordings of some words, including the word \"red\", so the crew took three sounds, a \"rrr\", a \"ehh\", and a \"duh\" from Disney's recordings and spliced them together.\n", "Disney had provided the voice for Mickey Mouse since his debut in 1928, and \"Fun and Fancy Free\" was the last time he would voice the role regularly, as he no longer had the time or energy to do so. Disney recorded most of Mickey's dialogue in the spring and summer of 1941. Sound effects artist Jimmy MacDonald would become the character's new voice actor, starting in 1948. Disney, however, did reprise the role for the introduction to the original 1955\u201359 run of \"The Mickey Mouse Club\".\n", "Walt Disney did the voice of Mickey Mouse for the first three episodes. Starting with the fourth episode, Mickey was voiced by comedian Joe Twerp. Disney appeared as himself in some early episodes. In later episodes, Disney was too busy to attend performances, and he was impersonated by announcer John Hiestand. Radio actor J. Donald Wilson provided the voice for one episode.\n", "Minnie was first voiced by Walt Disney, who was also the original voice of Mickey Mouse. Marjorie Ralston, a Disney inker who joined the animation team as Disney's thirteenth employee, voiced her in the 1929 short \"Wild Waves\", but did not further pursue the role out of shyness. Then, from 1930 until 1939, she was voiced by Marcellite Garner. Then from 1941 to 1942, and on the radio program, \"The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air\", she was voiced by Thelma Boardman. Following this, from 1942 to 1952 Ruth Clifford provided the character's voice. Janet Waldo voiced Minnie in the 1974 Disneyland record album, \"An Adaptation of Dickens' Christmas Carol, Performed by The Walt Disney Players\". Minnie Mouse would go without any spoken dialogue until 1986, when Russi Taylor inherited the role, which she performed until her death in 2019 (her husband, Wayne Allwine, voiced Mickey from 1977 until his death in 2009).\n", "BULLET::::- Minnie Mouse (voiced by Walt Disney through 1928 to 1929, Marjorie Ralston through 1929, Marcellite Garner through 1929 to 1939, Thelma Boardman through 1939 to 1942, Ruth Clifford through 1942 to 1952, Janet Waldo through 1974, and Russi Taylor through 1986 to present) \u2013 is a funny animal cartoon character created by Ub Iwerks and Walt Disney. She and Mickey Mouse were first drawn by Ub Iwerks in 1928.
