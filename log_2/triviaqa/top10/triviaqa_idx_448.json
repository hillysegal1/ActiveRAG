This historical context is crucial because it highlights how the scale was widely adopted before being renamed to honor Celsius in 1948. The transition from \"centigrade\" to \"Celsius\" reflects a move towards standardization in scientific terminology.\n\n**Expert 2: Scientific and Technical Perspective**\nFrom a scientific standpoint, the Celsius scale is now the preferred term in the International System of Units (SI). The renaming was not merely a matter of preference but was influenced by the need to avoid confusion with other uses of the term \"centigrade\" in different contexts, such as angular measurement. This perspective emphasizes the importance of clarity and precision in scientific communication, which is why the term \"Celsius\" was adopted.\n\n**Expert 3: Linguistic and Cultural Perspective**\nLinguistically, \"centigrade\" derives from Latin, meaning \"hundred steps,\" which aptly describes the scale's division into 100 degrees. However, the term was also used in various languages for angular measurements, leading to potential misunderstandings. This expert points out that the adoption of \"Celsius\" was not only a scientific decision but also a cultural one, aimed at reducing ambiguity in international contexts.\n\n**Expert 4: Modern Usage and Public Understanding**\nIn modern usage, many people still refer to the Celsius scale as \"centigrade,\" particularly in everyday conversation.

This name honors the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius, who developed the scale in 1742.

However, this was later reversed by Jean-Pierre Christin in 1743, who established the modern Celsius scale with 0 degrees as the freezing point and 100 degrees as the boiling point. The term \"centigrade\" was officially replaced by \"Celsius\" in 1948 to avoid confusion with other uses of the term in different contexts, such as angular measurement.\n\nThe Celsius scale is widely adopted globally, especially in scientific contexts, and is part of the International System of Units (SI). In contrast, the Fahrenheit scale remains prevalent in some English-speaking countries, illustrating the cultural and regional preferences in temperature measurement.\n\nUnderstanding the evolution of the terminology from \"centigrade\" to \"Celsius\" helps to illustrate how scientific language adapts over time. This evolution reflects the scientific community's need for clarity and precision in measurement, which can enhance the model's ability to infer relationships between historical events and changes in terminology.
