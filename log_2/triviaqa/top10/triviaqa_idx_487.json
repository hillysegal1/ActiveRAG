It correctly identifies Woody Herman's birth year (1913) and the founding year of his orchestra (1936). The arithmetic used to determine his age at the time of founding is also correct, yielding an age of 23 years. The additional context about his marriage and the potential range of ages (23 to 26) is a reasonable inference based on the information provided.\n\n### Knowledge Enhanced Inference Process\n\nTo enhance the reasoning process, we can incorporate additional context about the significance of founding an orchestra in the late 1930s, the cultural environment of that time, and how early career milestones can impact a musician's trajectory. \n\n1. **Birth Year**: Woody Herman was born on May 16, 1913.\n2. **Founding of Orchestra**: He founded his first orchestra, known as the Woody Herman Orchestra, in 1936.\n3. **Cultural Context**: The late 1930s was a pivotal time for jazz and big band music, with many musicians establishing their own bands to capitalize on the growing popularity of the genre.\n4. **Career Milestones**: Founding an orchestra at a young age indicates not only talent but also ambition and the ability to navigate the music industry, which can lead to greater opportunities and recognition.\n\n### Logical Inference:\nTo calculate Woody Herman's age when he founded his orchestra:\n- **Founding Year**: 1936\n- **Birth Year**: 1913\n\nCalculating his age:\n- **Age at Founding**: 1936 - 1913 = 23 years old\n\nGiven the cultural significance of this period and the fact that many musicians were establishing their own bands during this time, it is reasonable to conclude that founding an orchestra at 23 was a notable achievement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWoody Herman was 23 years old when he founded his own orchestra in 1936.
