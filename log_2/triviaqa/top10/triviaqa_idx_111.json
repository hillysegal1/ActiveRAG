The Gulf of Mexico is bordered by the southeastern United States, Mexico, and Cuba, while the Atlantic Ocean lies to the east.\n\n1. **Primary Connection**: The main geographical connection between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean is through the **Straits of Florida**, which is situated between the Florida Keys and Cuba. This narrow strait serves as a crucial passage for water exchange.\n\n2. **Ocean Currents**: The flow of water from the Gulf into the Atlantic is facilitated by the **Florida Current**, a warm ocean current that moves northward from the Gulf of Mexico into the Atlantic Ocean.
