Initial reactions to the statue were mixed, with complaints about its location in the theatre district and its perceived sensuality. This indicates that the statue was controversial from the outset, reflecting societal attitudes towards public art and memorials during that era.\n\n2. **Renaming and Public Perception**: Although the statue was officially named 'The Angel of Christian Charity'\u2014an attempt to align it with Christian values and the Greek god Anteros, who embodies love and affection\u2014this name did not resonate widely with the public. Instead, the statue became popularly known as \"Eros,\" the Greek god of sensual love. This shift in nomenclature highlights a disconnect between the statue's intended meaning and how it was interpreted by the public, suggesting that art can often take on meanings that diverge from their original intent.\n\n3. **Cultural Significance and Evolution**: Over time, despite early opposition, the statue has come to be recognized as a landmark in North East England. This illustrates how public sentiment can evolve, transforming a piece of art from a source of controversy to one of cultural significance. The acceptance of the statue as a landmark indicates a broader shift in societal values and attitudes toward public art.\n\n4. **Symbolism and Interpretation**: The preference for the name \"Eros\" over \"The Angel of Christian Charity\" reflects broader themes in art interpretation, where the emotional and aesthetic impact of a piece can overshadow its symbolic meaning. This underscores the importance of public perception in shaping the legacy of art.\n\nBy synthesizing this knowledge, we can conclude that the statue's more common name reflects both its controversial origins and the public's interpretation of its symbolism.\n\n### Answer:\nThe Angel of Christian Charity is more commonly known as \"Eros.\""}], "associate": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are part of a panel of experts engaged in a collaborative discussion to address the following question:\nHow is the London statue 'The Angel of Christian Charity' more commonly known?\n\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The memorial was unveiled by the Duke of Westminster on 29 June 1893.

It faced criticism for its perceived sensuality and inappropriate location in the theater district, which was seen as vulgar for a memorial to a respectable Earl. This context is crucial as it sets the stage for how the statue was received by the public.\n\n2. **Renaming and Common Reference**: Although the statue was officially named 'The Angel of Christian Charity' to align with Christian values, it was more commonly referred to as \"Eros,\" the Greek god of sensual love.

This cultural backdrop is essential for understanding why the statue is often associated with sensuality rather than charity.\n\n4. **Public Sentiment**: The public's reaction to the statue reflects broader societal attitudes towards art and memorials, particularly in urban settings.
