Hawthorns are typically small trees or shrubs characterized by their distinctive red berries, commonly referred to as haws. \n\nThe following points provide a deeper understanding of the hawthorn and its fruits:\n\n1. **Species Identification**: \n   - Several species within the **Crataegus** genus produce red haws. Notable examples include **Crataegus sanguinea** (redhaw hawthorn) and **Crataegus pinnatifida** (Chinese hawthorn). These species are recognized for their edible red fruits, which can be consumed in various ways.\n\n2. **Culinary Uses**: \n   - The haws from these trees are not only edible but are also used in culinary applications. For instance, **Crataegus monogyna** (common hawthorn) produces haws that are often made into jellies and wines, while **Crataegus pinnatifida** is used to create traditional Chinese snacks and beverages. This highlights the cultural and culinary significance of these fruits.\n\n3. **Diversity of Fruit Color**: \n   - While many hawthorn species produce red fruits, some can yield black, purple, yellow, or orange fruits. This diversity within the genus indicates that while red haws are prevalent, they are not the only color present among hawthorn fruits.\n\n4. **Cultural Context**: \n   - The use of haws in various cultures, such as in Chinese cuisine and Korean liquor production, emphasizes their importance beyond mere botanical classification. This cultural relevance adds depth to our understanding of the significance of haws.\n\n5. **Botanical Characteristics**: \n   - Haws typically appear in clusters and are known for their tart flavor, which may deter some from consuming them raw.
