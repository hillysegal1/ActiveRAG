Among its prominent figures was Andr\u00e9 Breton, a key leader who emphasized the importance of political engagement in art.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), the Surrealist movement was divided over political affiliations and responses to the conflict. Many Surrealists, including Breton, supported the Spanish Republic and leftist ideals, while others held differing views. One notable figure who faced expulsion from the Surrealist movement due to his controversial stance on the war was Salvador Dal\u00ed. \n\nDal\u00ed's support for Francisco Franco's Nationalist regime was seen as a betrayal of the leftist principles that many Surrealists upheld. This divergence in political beliefs not only led to tensions within the movement but ultimately resulted in Dal\u00ed's expulsion. The broader context of the Spanish Civil War, which polarized opinions and led to significant ideological divisions, played a crucial role in this outcome.\n\nIn analyzing the dynamics of the Surrealist movement, it becomes clear that political beliefs were not merely personal opinions but had tangible consequences for membership and collaboration within the movement. The expulsion of Dal\u00ed serves as a case study of how political alignment\u2014or misalignment\u2014can lead to significant social repercussions, such as exclusion from a collective artistic endeavor.\n\nFurthermore, understanding the historical context of the Spanish Civil War enhances our comprehension of the motivations behind such expulsions. The model can learn that shifts in political stance, especially during critical historical events, can lead to social consequences, including expulsion from artistic movements. This understanding fosters a nuanced appreciation of the complex interplay between art, politics, and individual beliefs.\n\n### Answer:\nSalvador Dal\u00ed was expelled from the Surrealist movement due to his views on the Spanish Civil War, specifically his support for Francisco Franco's regime, which conflicted with the leftist ideals held by many Surrealists, including Andr\u00e9 Breton."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nWho was expelled from the Surrealist movement due to his views on the Spanish Civil War?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['He joined the Mexican Communist Party in 1928, but was expelled in 1943 for his criticisms of the organisation\\'s bureaucratic practices and for one of the best analyses of the left in Mexico: \"Ensayo de un proletariado sin cabeza\" (Essay on a Proletariat without a Head).
