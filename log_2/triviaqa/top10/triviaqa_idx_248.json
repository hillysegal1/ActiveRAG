This river is crucial as it divides the city into two parts: the right bank (east) and the left bank (west). The geographical positioning of Bordeaux on the Garonne River significantly influences its urban layout and development.\n\n2. **Historical Significance**: Historically, the left bank of the Garonne has been more developed due to its deeper channel, which is more suitable for merchant ships. This historical context suggests that the river has played a vital role in the economic development of Bordeaux, particularly in trade and commerce.\n\n3. **Current Urban Development**: The right bank of the Garonne is currently undergoing significant urban development, indicating a shift in focus and investment. This evolution suggests that urban areas can change over time based on economic needs and planning initiatives.\n\n4. **Economic Implications**: The Garonne River's accessibility to ocean liners underscores its importance as a trade route. This accessibility implies a causal relationship between the river and the economic vitality of Bordeaux, as cities with better access to waterways tend to experience greater economic growth and cultural exchange.\n\n5. **Causal Relationships**: Understanding the relationship between Bordeaux and the Garonne River allows for inferences about how geographical features can influence urban development, trade patterns, and historical growth.

It is around southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the river Garonne, and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to ocean liners.
