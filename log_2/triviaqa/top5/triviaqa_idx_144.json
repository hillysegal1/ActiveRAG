This establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship: the action of traveling through time leads to events occurring in a different historical context.\n\n2. **Character Motivations**: Michael J. Fox's character, Marty McFly, is motivated to travel back to 1885 to rescue his friend, Dr. Emmett \"Doc\" Brown, who is in danger. This introduces a causal chain: Marty's discovery of Doc's peril in 1885 prompts his decision to time travel, which then leads to a series of events that unfold in the Wild West.\n\n3. **Setting and Production Choices**: The filmmakers created a specific historical setting (1885 Hill Valley) from scratch, indicating that the narrative is carefully constructed around the historical context of the Wild West. This highlights the importance of setting in causal reasoning, as the environment influences character actions and plot development.\n\n4. **Character Relationships**: The film explores interpersonal relationships, such as Doc's romantic involvement with Clara Clayton. This adds layers to the causal reasoning, as the dynamics between characters can influence decisions and outcomes, further complicating the narrative.\n\n5. **Themes of Human Journey**: The director's intention to focus on a \"human journey\" with spiritual overtones suggests that character development and emotional arcs are significant in understanding causality within the story.
