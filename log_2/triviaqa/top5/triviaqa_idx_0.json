It is situated at the western end of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and serves as a focal point for several major roads. Specifically, the Arc de Triomphe is at the center of a large roundabout known as Place Charles de Gaulle, which connects multiple avenues. \n\nTo determine how many avenues radiate from the Arc de Triomphe, we can consider the main roads that lead to and from the monument. There are 12 avenues that connect to the roundabout surrounding the Arc de Triomphe.

It serves as a central point for a large roundabout known as Place Charles de Gaulle, which connects multiple avenues. \n\nTo accurately determine how many avenues radiate from the Arc de Triomphe, we need to consider the main roads that lead to and from the monument. The retrieved knowledge indicates that there are at least four significant avenues mentioned in the passages:\n\n1. **Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es** - This avenue is one of the most famous in the world and begins at the Place Charles de Gaulle, connecting directly to the Arc de Triomphe.\n2. **Avenue de la Grande Arm\u00e9e** - This avenue continues from the Arc de Triomphe and leads toward the La D\u00e9fense area.\n3. **Avenue de Malakoff** - This avenue is mentioned as being part of the junction at the end of the avenue that begins at the Place Charles de Gaulle.\n4. **Boulevard Pereire** - This boulevard is also part of the junction mentioned in the passages.\n\nWhile the initial reasoning suggested that there are 12 avenues radiating from the Arc de Triomphe, the authoritative passages only confirm at least four significant routes. Therefore, it is essential to clarify that the model's previous assertion of 12 avenues may not be accurate based on the provided information.\n\nTo enhance the reasoning process, we should acknowledge that the Arc de Triomphe connects to a larger network of roads, but the specific avenues identified in the retrieved knowledge are the most relevant to the question. The total number of avenues may include smaller streets or connections not explicitly mentioned in the passages.\n\n**Answer:**\nAt least 4 significant avenues radiate from the Arc de Triomphe, including the Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, Avenue de la Grande Arm\u00e9e, Avenue de Malakoff, and Boulevard Pereire."}], "question_info": {"question": "How many avenues radiate from the Arc de Triomphe?", "passages": ["Arc de Triomphe\n", "The avenue begins at the Place Charles de Gaulle and ends in a junction with Avenue de Malakoff and Boulevard Pereire.
