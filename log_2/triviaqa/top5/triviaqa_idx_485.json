Today, we are exploring the question of which fictional detective has been portrayed by both John Hannah and Ken Stott. Let's dive into the insights from the passages provided and see how they inform our discussion.\n\n**Expert 1 (Literary Scholar):** From my understanding, both John Hannah and Ken Stott have played the role of Detective Inspector Rebus, a character created by the Scottish author Ian Rankin. This character is well-known in crime fiction, particularly in the context of Scottish noir. The passages provided do not directly mention Rebus, but they do highlight the actors' involvement in various roles, which suggests their versatility.\n\n**Expert 2 (Film and Television Critic):** I agree with Expert 1 regarding the character of Rebus. However, I would like to emphasize the significance of the adaptations of Rebus in television. John Hannah starred in the earlier adaptations of the Rebus novels, while Ken Stott took on the role in a later series. This transition reflects not only the evolution of the character but also the changing landscape of crime drama on television.\n\n**Expert 3 (Cultural Historian):** That's an interesting point. The portrayal of Rebus by different actors also highlights the cultural context in which these adaptations were made. John Hannah's portrayal came at a time when crime dramas were becoming more popular, while Ken Stott's version reflects a more contemporary approach to storytelling in the genre. This evolution can be seen in the way the character's moral complexities are explored.\n\n**Expert 4 (Media Studies Expert):** I would like to add that the differences in the portrayals also speak to the actors' individual styles. Hannah's Rebus was more introspective and perhaps more aligned with the literary roots of the character, while Stott's interpretation brought a grittier, more hard-edged realism to the role. This divergence in performance styles enriches the audience's understanding of Rebus as a character.\n\n**Expert 5 (Detective Fiction Specialist):** While we are all in agreement about the character of Rebus, I think it\u2019s important to note that the passages provided do not explicitly mention this character. They focus on other actors and roles, which might lead to confusion. It\u2019s crucial to clarify that our knowledge of Hannah and Stott's roles as Rebus is based on external sources rather than the passages themselves.\n\n**Moderator:** Excellent points, everyone. It seems we have a consensus on the character of Rebus, but there are nuances in how we perceive the adaptations and performances. \n\n**Synthesis of Insights:**\nThe discussion reveals that John Hannah and Ken Stott both portrayed Detective Inspector Rebus, a character from Ian Rankin's novels. Their performances reflect different eras and styles in crime drama, with Hannah's portrayal being more literary and introspective, while Stott's version is grittier and more aligned with contemporary storytelling.

However, the passages provided do not mention Rebus directly, which underscores the importance of external knowledge in understanding the contributions of these actors to the character.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis collaborative discussion enhances our understanding of how different portrayals of a single character can reflect broader trends in media and culture.
