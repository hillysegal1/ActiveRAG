Additionally, the title is associated with a Scottish comic farce novel and a television program, which may mislead one into thinking these works are more prominent than the painting itself.\n\nTo prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions, it is important to update the model's knowledge with the following key points:\n- The painting \"Monarch of the Glen\" is attributed to **Sir Edwin Landseer**.\n- The title \"Monarch of the Glen\" is also associated with other works, but these are not related to the painting.\n- The context of the title being used in literature and television should be clearly distinguished from its association with the painting.\n\nBy incorporating this information, the model can better differentiate between the various uses of the title and maintain accurate knowledge regarding the painting and its artist.\n\n**Answer: Sir Edwin Landseer.**"}], "question_info": {"question": "Which artist painted 'Monarch of the Glen'?", "passages": ["BULLET::::- \"The Monarch of the Glen\" (painting), a painting by Sir Edwin Landseer\n", "The Monarch of the Glen (painting)\n", "BULLET::::- 2002 \u2013 \"Monarch of the Glen\" - Andrew Booth\n", "BULLET::::- \"Monarch of the Glen\" (2002) - David Fraser\n", "The Monarch of the Glen is a Scottish comic farce novel written by English-born Scottish author Compton Mackenzie and published in 1941.
