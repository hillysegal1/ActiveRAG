It serves as the main ferry port for the island, indicating its importance as a transportation hub.\n   - **Torosay Castle**: This castle is situated south of Craignure, also on the Isle of Mull. The relationship between these two locations is crucial for understanding the railway's route.\n\n2. **Understanding the Railway**:\n   - The **Isle of Mull Railway** historically connected Craignure to Torosay Castle. It is important to note that this railway was a narrow gauge railway, which typically means it had a smaller track width than standard railways, often used in more rural or less accessible areas.\n   - The railway was operational until its closure in 2011, which is significant because it indicates that the railway is no longer in service, affecting how we interpret its relevance today.\n\n3. **Geographical Context**:\n   - The passages indicate that Torosay Castle is located \"miles south of Craignure,\" reinforcing the geographical relationship between the two locations on the Isle of Mull. This spatial relationship helps visualize the route of the railway.\n\n4. **Cultural and Historical Significance**:\n   - Understanding that Craignure is not only a village but also the main ferry port on the Isle of Mull adds depth to its significance.

It serves as the main ferry port on the island, which indicates its significance in terms of transport and accessibility.\n   - **Torosay Castle**: This castle is described as being situated miles south of Craignure, also on the Isle of Mull. This geographical relationship reinforces that both locations are on the same island.\n\n2. **Understanding the Railway**: \n   - The passage mentions that the **Isle of Mull Railway** ran from Craignure to Torosay Castle. This railway was a narrow gauge line, which is a specific type of railway that uses a narrower track gauge than the standard. The railway's operation is crucial for understanding the connectivity between these two locations.\n\n3. **Closure Context**: \n   - The railway was closed in 2011, with the formal announcement made in October 2010 due to uncertainties regarding the future of the estate associated with Torosay Castle. This closure indicates that while the railway once provided a connection between these two points, it is no longer operational.\n\n4. **Causal Relationships**: \n   - The closure of the railway can be linked to external factors, such as the management of the estate surrounding Torosay Castle. This demonstrates a cause-and-effect relationship where the status of the estate directly impacts the operational status of the railway.\n\n5. **Temporal and Spatial Reasoning**: \n   - The timeline of the railway's operation and closure allows for an understanding of how historical events shape current realities. Additionally, the spatial relationship between Craignure and Torosay Castle helps in visualizing the geographical layout of the island.\n\n6. **Contextual Inference**: \n   - The closure of the railway affects accessibility to Torosay Castle, which could have implications for tourism and local economic activities. This broader inference highlights the interconnectedness of transportation, landmarks, and economic factors.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy synthesizing this information, we can confidently conclude that the narrow gauge railway that ran from Craignure to Torosay Castle is located on the **Isle of Mull**.

Craignure is a village located on the Isle of Mull in Scotland. The railway in question is known to connect Craignure to Torosay Castle, which is also situated on the Isle of Mull. \n\nHowever, it is crucial to note that the Isle of Mull Railway, which operated this route, closed in 2011. This means that while the railway once connected these two locations, it is no longer operational.

The railway was a narrow gauge railway, which is an important detail that specifies the type of railway that once operated between these points.\n\nThus, while the answer to the question about the island remains the Isle of Mull, it is essential to clarify that the railway is no longer in operation, which is a significant update to the model's knowledge.\n\n**Answer:**\nIsle of Mull (Note: The narrow gauge railway from Craignure to Torosay Castle closed in 2011 and is no longer operational.)"}], "question_info": {"question": "On which island does a narrow gauge railway run from Craignure to Torosay Castle?", "passages": ["The Isle of Mull Railway ran from Craignure to Torosay Castle but closed in 2011.\n", "Craignure railway station was on the now closed narrow gauge Isle of Mull Railway.\n", "Torosay Castle is a large house situated miles south of Craignure on the Isle of Mull, in the Scottish Inner Hebrides.\n", "Craignure (; ) is a village and the main ferry port on the Isle of Mull, Argyll and Bute, Scotland.
