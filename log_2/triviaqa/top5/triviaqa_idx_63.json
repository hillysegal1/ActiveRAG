Madame de Pompadour, who was the king's mistress from 1745 until her death in 1764, played a crucial role in the arts and politics of the time.

Madame de Pompadour was often respected for her intellect and influence, while Madame du Barry faced significant criticism and was seen as a more scandalous figure.
