This adds context to how an Albatross is typically scored, which could be useful for the model to understand the practical application of the term.\n\n4. **Thematic Continuation**: The passages mention that the term \"albatross\" follows the theme of bird-related terms in golf, such as \"birdie\" and \"eagle.\" This thematic connection could provide additional context for the model regarding the naming conventions in golf.\n\nThese points do not contradict existing knowledge but rather serve to enhance and clarify the model's understanding of the term \"Albatross\" in the context of golf. By incorporating this information, the model can provide more accurate and comprehensive responses related to golf terminology and scoring.\nPlease verify the above reasoning process for errors, \nthen enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to update the language model's knowledge, prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions.\nAfterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n\nGeneration Format:\nknowledge enhanced inference process:\nAnswer:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Knowledge Enhanced Inference Process:**\n\nIn golf, the term \"par\" refers to the number of strokes that an expert golfer is expected to take to complete a hole. An \"Albatross\" is a term used to describe a score that is significantly better than par. Specifically, an Albatross is defined as being three strokes under par for a given hole. This means that if a hole is a par 5, an Albatross would be achieved by completing the hole in 2 strokes.\n\nAdditionally, the term \"double eagle\" is used interchangeably with \"Albatross,\" which is an important detail that enhances the understanding of golf terminology. An Albatross is most commonly achieved on a par-5 hole with two shots, but it can also be accomplished with a hole-in-one on a par-4. This context is crucial for understanding how an Albatross is typically scored.\n\nFurthermore, the term \"Albatross\" follows the theme of bird-related terms in golf, such as \"birdie\" and \"eagle.\" This thematic connection provides additional context for the naming conventions in golf.\n\nBy integrating this knowledge, the model can provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the term \"Albatross\" in golf, ensuring that it recognizes both the definition and the context in which the term is used.\n\n**Answer:**\nAn Albatross is 3 strokes under par for a given hole."}], "question_info": {"question": "In the game of golf, an Albatross is how many strokes under par for a given hole?", "passages": ["BULLET::::- Albatross (golf), a score of three under par on a hole\n", "BULLET::::- \"albatross\" in golf denotes three strokes less than par.
