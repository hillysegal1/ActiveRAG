Among these candidates, it is important to recognize that there were two notable female contenders: **Margaret Beckett** and **Diane Abbott**. \n\nInitially, Margaret Beckett was the only female Labour MP to stand for the leadership of the party until **Diane Abbott** announced her candidacy on **20 May 2010**. This indicates that while Beckett was the first female candidate, she was not the only one, as Abbott's candidacy followed shortly thereafter. \n\nThus, both Beckett and Abbott participated in the contest, but Abbott is often highlighted as a significant figure due to her long-standing political career and representation in Parliament. Therefore, it is crucial to clarify that the statement about there being only one female candidate is misleading; rather, there were two, with Abbott being a prominent candidate.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTo accurately reflect the facts, it is essential to update the model's knowledge to include that both **Margaret Beckett** and **Diane Abbott** were female candidates in the 2010 Labour leadership contest, with Abbott being a notable contender.\n\nAnswer:\nDiane Abbott and Margaret Beckett were both female candidates in the 2010 Labour leadership contest, with Abbott being a prominent contender."}], "question_info": {"question": "Who was the only female candidate in the 2010 Labour leadership contest?", "passages": ["Margaret Beckett had been the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, and following Smith's death was serving as acting leader; she was the only female Labour MP ever to stand for the leadership of the party (and remained so until Diane Abbott announced her candidacy on 20 May 2010).
