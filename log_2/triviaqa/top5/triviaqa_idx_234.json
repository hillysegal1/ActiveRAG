It is recognized for containing the highest point on the surface of Venus, specifically the peak known as Skadi Mons. This peak is significant because it is the highest elevation on the planet, surpassing all other geological features in height. \n\nThe geographical context is further enriched by noting that Maxwell Montes is situated on Ishtar Terra, which is the more northern of Venus's two major highland regions. This detail helps clarify the location of Maxwell Montes within the broader geological framework of Venus.\n\nAdditionally, Maxwell Montes rises approximately 6.4 kilometers (or about 21,000 feet) above Lakshmi Planum, providing important information about its elevation relative to other features on the planet. The terrain of Maxwell Montes is characterized by steep western slopes and more gradual eastern slopes that descend into Fortuna Tessera, which adds to the understanding of its geological structure.\n\nMoreover, due to its significant elevation, Maxwell Montes is noted to be the coolest and least pressurized location on the surface of Venus. This environmental context is crucial for understanding the conditions present in this mountainous region.\n\nBy integrating these details, the model can improve its accuracy regarding Maxwell Montes and its characteristics, thereby reducing the likelihood of model illusions or overconfidence in incorrect outputs.\n\n**Answer:** Venus"}], "question_info": {"question": "The mountain massif called Maxwell Montes contains the highest point on the surface of which planet?", "passages": ["Maxwell Montes is a mountain massif on the planet Venus, of which a peak (Skadi Mons) is the highest point on the planet's surface.\n", "Located on Ishtar Terra, the more northern of the planet's two major highlands, Maxwell Montes is high.
