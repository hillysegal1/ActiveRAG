Among the British Overseas Territories during World War II, Gibraltar is particularly notable due to its critical position at the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea. This location was vital for controlling naval traffic and military operations.\n\n2. **Strategic Importance of Gibraltar**:\n   - Gibraltar served as a key military outpost for the Allies, and its capture would have allowed the Axis powers to disrupt Allied shipping routes and potentially gain a tactical advantage in the Mediterranean theater. The strategic significance of Gibraltar is underscored by its geographical location, which makes it a focal point for naval operations.\n\n3. **Collaboration with Spain**:\n   - The operation involved a joint plan between Germany and Spain, indicating a broader geopolitical context. Spain, under Franco, had a complex relationship with Nazi Germany, and this collaboration highlights the importance of regional alliances and the potential for coordinated military action.\n\n4. **Broader Geographical Implications**:\n   - The planning of Operation Felix included considerations for the potential invasion of other locations, such as Portugal, Madeira, and the Azores. This suggests that the Germans were not only focused on Gibraltar but were also contemplating a wider strategy to secure control over the Iberian Peninsula and surrounding territories.\n\n5. **Historical Context and Execution**:\n   - It is crucial to note that Operation Felix was never executed. Understanding the reasons behind the abandonment of such operations can provide insights into the shifting priorities and resource allocations of the German military during the war. Factors such as the changing dynamics of the conflict and the emergence of other military engagements likely influenced this decision.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy synthesizing this information, we can conclude that Operation Felix was specifically aimed at Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory of great strategic importance during World War II.

The expert panel discussion highlights several key points that enhance our understanding of Operation Felix:\n\n1. **Military Importance**: As noted by the military historian, Gibraltar's significance as a gateway to the Mediterranean was paramount. Capturing Gibraltar would have allowed the Axis powers to control access to this vital maritime route, thereby disrupting Allied shipping and military operations.\n\n2. **Broader Strategic Implications**: The strategic analyst emphasized that Operation Felix was not limited to Gibraltar alone. The plan included potential invasions of surrounding territories such as Portugal, the Canary Islands, Madeira, and the Azores. This indicates that the Germans had a more extensive campaign in mind, aiming for regional dominance rather than a singular focus on Gibraltar.\n\n3. **Political Dynamics**: The political scientist pointed out the collaboration with Spain, which adds complexity to the operation. The Germans sought to leverage Franco's regime to facilitate their plans, highlighting the diplomatic considerations that intertwined with military strategy. The failure to initiate the operation reflects not only military challenges but also the political landscape of the time.\n\n4. **Naval Considerations**: The naval historian underscored the importance of Gibraltar in naval warfare.

The British Overseas Territories included several strategically significant locations, but Gibraltar is particularly noteworthy due to its position at the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea. This strategic location made it a prime target for military operations aimed at controlling maritime access.\n\n2. **Historical Significance of Gibraltar**: Gibraltar's capture would have allowed the Axis powers to disrupt Allied shipping routes and military operations in the Mediterranean, which was vital for the Allies' supply lines and troop movements. This context underscores the importance of Gibraltar in the broader scope of the war.\n\n3. **Details of Operation Felix**: The operation was not only focused on Gibraltar but also included plans for potential control over other territories, such as the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, and the Azores. This indicates a comprehensive strategy aimed at expanding Axis influence in the region.\n\n4. **Conditional Reasoning**: The plan also considered a potential invasion of Portugal if the British managed to establish a foothold in Gibraltar. This introduces a conditional aspect: the success of one military operation could lead to further actions, demonstrating how military strategies are interconnected.\n\n5. **Outcome of the Operation**: Importantly, Operation Felix was never initiated.

This reinforces the model's existing knowledge but confirms that Gibraltar is the sole British Overseas Territory associated with this operation.\n\n2. **Broader Context**: Some passages mention that Operation Felix was part of a broader strategy that included potential invasions of other territories, such as Portugal, Madeira, the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, and the Azores. This information adds context to the operation and suggests that while Gibraltar was the main focus, there were considerations for additional territories, which may not be widely recognized.\n\n3. **Joint Plan**: The mention of Operation Felix as a \"Spanish/German joint plan\" indicates a collaborative aspect that may not be fully captured in the model's existing knowledge. This highlights the involvement of Spain in the planning stages, which could be an important detail for understanding the geopolitical dynamics of the time.\n\n4. **Uninitiated Operation**: The passages clarify that Operation Felix was never initiated.
