This marked the beginning of a long period of Dutch colonial rule, which lasted until the mid-20th century.\n\n2. **Interruption by Japanese Occupation**: During World War II, from 1942 to 1945, the Japanese occupied Indonesia, temporarily displacing Dutch control. This occupation significantly affected the political landscape and the aspirations of Indonesian nationalists.\n\n3. **Independence Movement**: After Japan's surrender in 1945, Indonesian nationalists declared independence, asserting their claim over the territory previously known as the Dutch East Indies. This declaration was a pivotal moment in Indonesia's struggle for sovereignty.\n\n4. **Conflict and Negotiation**: The period from 1945 to 1949 was marked by a diplomatic and armed struggle between the Dutch and Indonesian republicans. The Dutch sought to reestablish their colonial authority, but faced significant resistance from the Indonesian independence movement.\n\n5. **International Dynamics**: The involvement of international powers, particularly the United States, played a crucial role in mediating the conflict. The U.S. aimed to balance the interests of the Dutch, British, and Indonesian nationalists, reflecting the complexities of post-war geopolitics.\n\n6. **Formal Recognition of Independence**: Ultimately, in December 1949, the Netherlands officially recognized Indonesian sovereignty, marking the end of over 350 years of colonial rule.

In 1945, the Indonesians declared their independence from the Japanese empire. It took four years of rebellion and negotiations with the United Nations before the Netherlands finally recognized the independent status of Indonesia. The Dutch saw the US as a potential blocker in their attempts to regain control of the region, and the U.S. had to play a large mediating role in Indonesia as they needed to appease the Dutch, the British, and the Indonesians themselves.

A four and half year diplomatic and armed struggle ensued between the Dutch and Indonesian republicans.

Unable to reach a compromise on the region, the conference closed with the parties agreeing to discuss the issue within one year.\\n', \"In December 1949, at the end of the Indonesian National Revolution, the Netherlands agreed to recognise Indonesian sovereignty over the territories of the former Dutch East Indies, with the exception of Western New Guinea, which the Dutch continued to hold as Netherlands New Guinea. The nationalist Indonesian government argued that it was the successor state to the whole of the Dutch East Indies and wanted to end the Dutch colonial presence in the archipelago. The Netherlands argued that the Papuans were ethnically different and that the Netherlands would continue to administer the territory until it was capable of self-determination. From 1950 onwards, the Dutch and the Western powers agreed that the Papuans should be given an independent state, but due to global considerations, mainly the Kennedy administration's concern to keep Indonesia on their side of the Cold War, the United States pressured the Dutch to sacrifice Papua's independence and transfer the territory to Indonesia.\\n\", 'The Indonesian national revolution (1945\u20131949) ended with the Netherlands\\' recognition of the Republic of Indonesia.
