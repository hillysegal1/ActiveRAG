Initially, I recall that \"Step Inside Love\" is a title linked to a notable figure in the music industry, specifically Cilla Black. However, upon reviewing the retrieved passages, I find that \"Step Inside Love\" is actually a song written by Paul McCartney (credited as \"Lennon\u2013McCartney\") for Cilla Black in 1967, intended as a theme for her TV series that aired in 1968.\n\n1. **Title and Attribution**: The passages confirm that \"Step Inside Love\" is primarily recognized as a song rather than an autobiography.
