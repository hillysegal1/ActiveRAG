Bilateral committees are negotiating the dispute with Venezuela over waters in the Gulf of Venezuela. Other issues with Venezuela include the presence of illegal undocumented Colombians in Venezuela, and activities of Colombian narcotics traffickers, and Venezuela's support for the Guerrillas in Colombia.\\n\"]\n\nTask Description:\nPlease extract content from these passages that may be contradictory to the model's existing knowledge. \nIdentify information that, when added, could update the model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions. \nNote that these passages are retrieved from the most authoritative knowledge repositories, so they are assumed to be correct.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the provided passages, the relevant information regarding Ecuador's borders can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Ecuador's Borders**: The third passage states that Ecuador is bordered by Colombia to the north and Peru to the east and south.
