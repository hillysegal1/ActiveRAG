She is indeed portrayed as a spoiled girl, indulged by her wealthy parents, which serves as a critique of consumerism and entitlement. Her character is pivotal in illustrating the consequences of such behavior, as she is ultimately ejected from the tour for her demanding nature. This reflects Dahl's broader themes of morality and the consequences of one's actions.\n\n**Expert 2: Child Psychologist**\nFrom a psychological perspective, Veruca Salt's behavior can be analyzed through the lens of parenting styles. Her parents' indulgence exemplifies permissive parenting, which often leads to children lacking self-discipline and respect for others.
