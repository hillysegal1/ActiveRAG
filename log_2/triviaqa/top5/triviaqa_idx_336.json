The Fitzroy sea area is significant in maritime navigation and has undergone changes in naming conventions over time.\n\nInitially, the model's reasoning suggested that Fitzroy was known as \"Port of Fitzroy\" or \"Fitzroy River.\" However, this is not accurate in the context of the specific shipping area referred to in the question. \n\nUpon reviewing the authoritative passages, it is clear that the Fitzroy sea area was previously known as **Finisterre** until it was officially renamed in **2002**.
