The transition from a serious legal drama to a more comedic tone in 'Boston Legal' reflects a shift in narrative style that David E. Kelley is known for.

This period saw a rise in legal dramas that incorporated humor, which was somewhat of a departure from the more serious tone of earlier shows. 'Boston Legal' not only maintained continuity with 'The Practice' but also contributed to the genre's evolution by blending legal issues with social commentary, which was particularly relevant during its airing.\"\n\n**Expert 3: Cultural Critic**\n\"Building on that point, I think it's essential to discuss how 'Boston Legal' tackled contemporary issues through its humor. The show was known for its political commentaries, which resonated with audiences and critics alike. Winning the Peabody Award in 2005 for its commentary is a testament to its impact. The comedic elements allowed for a more accessible discussion of complex legal and social issues, making it a unique entry in the legal drama-comedy genre.\"\n\n**Expert 4: Audience Reception Analyst**\n\"While I appreciate the critical acclaim and the show's innovative approach, I think we should also consider audience reception.
