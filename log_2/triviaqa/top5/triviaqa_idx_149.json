This collection also included other well-known stories like 'Cinderella' and 'Bluebeard,' showcasing Perrault's influence on the genre.\n\n3. **Addressing Misattributions**: \n   - There was an initial suggestion that Perrault's son, Pierre, might have contributed to the tales, but modern scholarship largely attributes the authorship solely to Charles Perrault.
