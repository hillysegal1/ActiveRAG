The first set was established in 1899, followed by a second set in 1907. These conventions aimed to regulate the conduct of warfare and included provisions regarding the use of weapons.\n\n2. **Hague Convention of 1899**: This convention included several important articles that addressed the laws and customs of war on land and at sea. Notably, it prohibited the use of \"poison and poisoned arms\" and established a declaration against the use of projectiles designed to diffuse asphyxiating gases. This indicates an early recognition of the need to regulate the types of weapons used in conflict to prevent unnecessary suffering.\n\n3. **Hague Convention of 1907**: This convention expanded upon the earlier one and included further regulations concerning the conduct of hostilities, including the use of weapons. It reaffirmed and updated many principles established in the 1899 convention and introduced specific regulations regarding bombardment by land (Hague IV) and naval forces (Hague IX).\n\n4. **Specific Articles**: Both conventions contain specific articles that address the use of certain types of weapons, such as the prohibition of weapons that cause unnecessary suffering or have indiscriminate effects. For example, the 1907 Hague IV convention reaffirmed the prohibition of expanding or flattening bullets in international warfare.\n\n5. **Impact on International Law**: The treaties set a precedent for the development of international humanitarian law and influenced subsequent agreements, including the Geneva Conventions. They represent a collective effort by nations to establish norms governing warfare, reflecting a growing recognition of the need to protect non-combatants and regulate the means of warfare.\n\n6. **Causal Relationships**: Understanding the historical context and specific prohibitions established by the Hague Conventions allows us to infer the causal relationships between the use of certain weapons and their humanitarian impacts. For instance, the prohibition of chemical weapons can be linked to the desire to prevent suffering and protect non-combatants.\n\n7. **Logical Framework for Treaties**: The model can develop a logical framework for analyzing treaties, understanding how different clauses relate to one another, and how they collectively aim to regulate warfare. This enhances the ability to infer the implications of specific treaty provisions on military conduct.\n\n8. **Precedent and Evolution of Law**: The evolution of international law as seen through these treaties helps infer how past agreements influence current legal standards and practices. This understanding aids in predicting how new treaties might be shaped by historical precedents.\n\n9. **Application of Legal Principles**: The model can learn to apply principles derived from these treaties to hypothetical scenarios, enhancing its ability to reason about legal and ethical implications in warfare. For instance, it can infer the legality of certain military actions based on established norms from the Hague Conventions.\n\n### Answer:\nThe international treaties of 1899 and 1907 that cover the use of weapons in war are the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. The 1899 convention prohibited the use of \"poison and poisoned arms\" and established a declaration against the use of asphyxiating gases. The 1907 convention expanded upon these regulations, including specific provisions regarding bombardment by land and naval forces, thereby laying the groundwork for modern international humanitarian law."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nWhich international treaties of 1899 and 1907 cover the use of weapons in war?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['International law relating to aerial bombardment before and during World War II rests on the treaties of 1864, 1899, and 1907, which constituted the definition of most of the laws of war at that time \u2014 which, despite repeated diplomatic attempts, was not updated in the immediate run up to World War II.
