The primary goal is to identify the colloquial name that has gained popularity over time, as well as the historical and cultural context surrounding the statue.\n\n1. **Historical Context**: The statue was unveiled in 1893 and faced immediate controversy regarding its appropriateness and location. The official name \"The Angel of Christian Charity\" was intended to align the statue with Christian values, but it quickly became overshadowed by the public's adoption of the name \"Eros,\" which references the Greek god of love. This indicates a disconnect between the statue's intended solemnity and its sensual representation.\n\n2. **Cultural Implications**: The statue's placement in the theatre district of London, an area known for its vibrant nightlife, adds layers to its interpretation.
