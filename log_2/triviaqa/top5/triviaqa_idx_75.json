The passages mention that both countries are members of NATO and the European Union, which fosters a cooperative relationship.

This border is approximately 68 km long and has remained unchanged since 1921, following referendums in 1920 that solidified its current boundaries.\n\n2. **Understanding Maritime Borders**:\n   - While Denmark shares maritime borders with Sweden, Norway, and Canada, these do not constitute land borders. The maritime border with Sweden runs along the \u00d8resund for about 115 km, but it is essential to distinguish that maritime borders do not imply direct land adjacency.\n\n3. **Historical Context**:\n   - The Danish-German border has a complex history, having changed multiple times due to historical events. This historical perspective is crucial as it illustrates that borders can be influenced by political and social dynamics over time. Understanding this context allows for a deeper comprehension of current geopolitical relationships.\n\n4. **Cross-Border Dynamics**:\n   - The border area between Denmark and Germany is characterized by cross-border cooperation and the presence of substantial minority populations. This indicates that borders are not merely lines on a map but represent cultural and social interactions that can influence bilateral relations.\n\n5. **Causal Reasoning**:\n   - By recognizing that Denmark has only one land border with Germany, the model can infer that any discussions about Denmark's borders should focus on Germany when considering land interactions.

It is primarily made up of the Jutland Peninsula and numerous islands. To determine which country shares a land border with Denmark, we need to consider its geographical location. The only country that shares a land border with Denmark is Germany, which is located to the south of the Jutland Peninsula. Other neighboring countries, such as Sweden and Norway, are separated by water and do not share a land border with Denmark.\n\nAnswer: Germany\nTo update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions. \nI retrieved some knowledge that may update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions\nNote that these passages are retrieved from the most authoritative knowledge repositories, so they are assumed to be correct.\nknowledge:\nBased on the provided passages, the following information can be extracted that may update the model's knowledge regarding Denmark's land borders:\n\n1. **Denmark's Land Border with Germany**: The first passage explicitly states that \"The only land border of Denmark is that with Germany, with a length of 68 km.\" This confirms that Denmark shares a land border solely with Germany, which aligns with the model's existing knowledge but reinforces the accuracy of this fact.\n\n2. **Historical Context of the Border**: The fourth passage mentions that \"the present border was determined by referendums in 1920.\" This historical context could be relevant for understanding the significance of the border and its changes over time, which may not be included in the model's existing knowledge.\n\n3. **Maritime Borders**: The third passage notes that Denmark has maritime borders with Sweden, Norway, and Canada, which could be useful for clarifying the distinction between land and maritime borders.

Denmark is primarily composed of the Jutland Peninsula and numerous islands, situated in Northern Europe. \n\n1. **Land Border Identification**: The first passage confirms that \"The only land border of Denmark is that with Germany, with a length of 68 km.\" This statement directly answers the question and reinforces the model's existing knowledge that Germany is the only country sharing a land border with Denmark.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: The fourth passage provides additional context by stating that \"the present border was determined by referendums in 1920.\" This historical detail is significant as it highlights the political and social processes that shaped the current borders, which may not have been included in the model's prior knowledge.\n\n3. **Clarification of Maritime Borders**: The third passage mentions that Denmark has maritime borders with Sweden, Norway, and Canada. This distinction is crucial as it clarifies that while Denmark is geographically close to these countries, they do not share a land border. This information helps prevent any confusion regarding Denmark's relationships with its neighboring countries.\n\n4. **Cross-Border Cooperation**: The fourth passage also discusses the positive examples of cross-border cooperation in the Danish-German border area. This insight into the socio-political dynamics of the border region could enhance the model's understanding of the implications of the land border beyond mere geography.\n\nBy integrating this information, we can confirm that Denmark's only land border is with Germany, supported by historical context and clarification of maritime relationships.
