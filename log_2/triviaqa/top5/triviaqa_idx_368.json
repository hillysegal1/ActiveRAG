In the book \"Madonna\\'s Drowned Worlds\" the use of Catholic imagery in the video is discussed. Author Santiago Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez points out that unlike Madonna\\'s previous music videos, much of the religious imagery is associated with the torero, not Madonna, due to the fact that religious images are a strong part of the bullfighting ritual. It has also been argued that in the video Madonna \"subverts the gender structure and masculine subjectivity implicit in traditional bullfighting.\" This is achieved through the \"feminization of the matador and the emphasis on Madonna\\'s character\" and also through Madonna\\'s \"dominant gaze\" as she watches the matador perform.\"\\n', 'The music video, directed by Mary Lambert, portrays Madonna as a witness to the murder of a girl by white supremacists. While a black man is arrested for the murder, Madonna hides in a church for safety, seeking strength to go forth as a witness. The clip depicts a church and Catholic symbols such as stigmata. It also features a Ku Klux Klan-style cross burning, and a dream about kissing a black saint. The Vatican condemned the video, while family and religious groups protested against its broadcast. They boycotted products by soft drink manufacturer Pepsi, who had used the song in their commercial. The company canceled their sponsorship contract with Madonna, but allowed her to retain the fee.\\n', 'In January 1989, Madonna signed an endorsement deal with soft-drink manufacturer, Pepsi. In one of her Pepsi commercials, she debuted \"Like a Prayer\", the lead single from her fourth studio album of same name. The corresponding music video featured many Catholic symbols such as stigmata and cross burning, and a dream of making love to a saint, leading the Vatican to condemn the video. Religious groups sought to ban the commercial and boycott Pepsi products. Pepsi revoked the commercial and canceled her sponsorship contract. \"Like a Prayer\" topped the charts in many countries, becoming her seventh number one on the Hot 100.\\n', 'The Latinos in the video are portrayed as stereotypes as nonchalant people, unemployed adults, school deprived children and a crumbling \"barrio\". However, the music video was critically appreciated in many quarters for its utilization of Hispanic fashion as an icon of beauty and romanticism. Collen McDanell, in his book \"Material Christianity\", noted Madonna\\'s use of Catholic objects in the video like the candlestands and home shrines, thereby giving them a new meaning according to her own. Author Douglas Kellner noted, \"such \\'multiculturalism\\' and her culturally transgressive moves turned out to be highly successful moves that endeared her to large and varied youth audiences\". Madonna\\'s Andalusian look in the video became popular and appeared in the fashion trends at that time in the form of boleros and layered skirts accessorizing with rosary beads and crucifix like the video.\\n', 'Theorist Douglas Kellner further asserted that the video was a feminist critique of male fighting and brutality, with images of the male workers engaged in a boxing match at the end. According to him, Madonna deliberately appropriated traditional feminine images in the beginning of the video, but contrasted them with her \"crotch-hugging\" male poses near the end, and discordant images of women assuming the male position. As feminist author Susan Bordo pointed out, \"it is the postmodern nature of the video that has most entranced academic critics, and its various ways of constituting identities that refuse stability, that remain fluid, that resist definition.\" At the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards, \"Express Yourself\" was nominated in the categories of Best Female Video, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Direction and Best Art Direction, winning the last three categories. \"Billboard\" also honored the video as the Best Music Video of the year, at their Music Video Awards for 1989. The music video of \"Express Yourself\" is ranked at number one on Slant Magazine\\'s \"100 Greatest Music Videos\". It is also placed at number ten on both \"Rolling Stone\"\\'s \"The 100 Top Music Videos\" and MTV\\'s \"100 Greatest Videos Ever Made\", as well as number three on MuchMusic\\'s list of \"Top 100 Videos of The Century\".

These elements are strongly associated with the music video for \"Like a Prayer,\" which was released in 1989.\n\n2. **Religious Imagery**: The music video is known for its provocative use of Catholic iconography. The presence of stigmata and a burning cross are significant symbols that have historically been contentious, especially in the context of religious beliefs. This aligns with the details in the question and indicates the video\u2019s potential to provoke criticism.\n\n3. **Criticism and Backlash**: The backlash against \"Like a Prayer\" was substantial, leading to condemnation from the Vatican and protests from various religious groups. This illustrates a clear cause-and-effect relationship: the provocative imagery led to public outrage and a boycott of Pepsi products, which had sponsored the video. This dynamic highlights how artistic expression can lead to significant social and commercial consequences.\n\n4. **Narrative Context**: The narrative of the video, which includes themes of witnessing violence and seeking refuge in a church, adds depth to the imagery. This context is crucial for understanding the implications of the video beyond its surface-level controversy, as it engages with issues of race and social justice.\n\n5. **Cultural Sensitivity and Market Dynamics**: The video also incorporates elements of Hispanic culture and critiques traditional gender roles, which can influence audience perceptions. The contrast between the public outrage and the commercial success of the song demonstrates a complex relationship between societal values and consumer behavior, suggesting that public sentiment does not always dictate market outcomes.\n\n6. **Symbolic Interpretation**: The use of religious symbols in the video serves as a commentary on faith and societal issues, illustrating how meanings can shift based on context.
