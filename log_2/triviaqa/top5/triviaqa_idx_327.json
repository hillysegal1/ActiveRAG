The River Thames runs through central London, and several railway stations are situated near it. However, only one prominent station is actually built on a bridge over the river. \n\nThe station that fits this description is London Bridge Station. It is a well-known railway station that spans the River Thames, connecting various lines and serving numerous passengers daily.

The River Thames flows through central London, and while many railway stations are situated nearby, only one prominent station is actually built on a bridge over the river.\n\n1. **London Bridge Station**: This station is a well-known railway terminus located in Southwark, south-east London. It is explicitly situated on a bridge that spans the River Thames, making it unique among London's railway stations. The retrieved passages confirm its status as a central terminus but do not explicitly state that it is located on a bridge, which is a critical detail that should be emphasized.\n\n2. **City Thameslink**: This station is mentioned in the passages but is not located on a bridge over the River Thames. It is situated within the City of London and does not meet the criteria of being on a bridge.\n\n3. **General Knowledge**: It is widely recognized that London Bridge is not only a bridge but also the name of the railway station that occupies it. This dual significance reinforces the importance of explicitly stating that London Bridge Station is located on a bridge over the River Thames.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe passages retrieved do not clearly state that London Bridge Station is on a bridge, which could lead to confusion. Therefore, it is essential to update the language model's knowledge to reflect that **London Bridge railway station is indeed located on a bridge over the River Thames**. This clarification helps prevent factual errors and alleviates model illusions regarding the geographical context of the station.\n\n### Answer:\nLondon Bridge Station"}], "question_info": {"question": "Which famous London railway station is located on a bridge over the River Thames?", "passages": ["London Bridge is a central London railway terminus and connected London Underground station in Southwark, south-east London.
