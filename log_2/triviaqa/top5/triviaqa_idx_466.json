The memorial was commissioned in 1864 and is widely recognized for its Gothic Revival architectural style. The architect responsible for its design is **Sir George Gilbert Scott**, a prominent figure in Victorian architecture.\n\nThe question specifies the year 1875, which is relevant because it falls within the period of the memorial's construction. Although the memorial was officially opened in **1872**, the design and construction processes were ongoing during the years leading up to its completion in **1876**. \n\nFrom the retrieved passages, we confirm that:\n1. Sir George Gilbert Scott is consistently identified as the architect of the Albert Memorial.\n2. The memorial was opened in **1872**, which aligns with the timeline of Scott's involvement.\n3. There is a passage that mentions the memorial was built in **1849** to designs by Frederick W. Ordish and John Johnson. This information is misleading in the context of the final design attributed to Scott and may refer to earlier proposals or contributions that did not result in the completed memorial.\n\nTo clarify:\n- The Albert Memorial was designed by **Sir George Gilbert Scott**.\n- The construction was completed in **1876**, with significant work occurring during the years leading up to that date, including **1875**.\n- The reference to Ordish and Johnson should be contextualized as potentially related to earlier designs rather than the final work attributed to Scott.\n\nBy incorporating this enhanced understanding, the model can better represent the historical facts surrounding the Albert Memorial and its architect, thus alleviating potential model illusions.\n\n### Answer:\nSir George Gilbert Scott."}], "question_info": {"question": "Which architect designed the Albert Memorial in 1875?", "passages": ["It was built in 1849 to designs by Frederick W.
