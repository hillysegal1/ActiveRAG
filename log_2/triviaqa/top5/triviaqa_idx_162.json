This is somewhat misleading as it repeats \"Akmolinsk.\" The correct sequence is Akmolinsk \u2192 Tselinograd \u2192 Akmolinsk \u2192 Astana \u2192 Nur-Sultan \u2192 Astana.\n\n2. **Designation as Capital**: The reasoning states that the city was designated as the capital in 1997, which is accurate, but it could also mention that Almaty was the previous capital, providing a clearer historical context.\n\n### Knowledge Enhanced Inference Process:\nTo enhance the reasoning process, we can incorporate additional historical context and clarify the sequence of name changes. \n\n1. **Historical Context**: The city has undergone several name changes reflecting its political and cultural history. Understanding these changes can help the model recognize how political decisions can influence geographical naming conventions.\n\n2. **Causal Relationships**: The model can learn that the designation of a capital city often reflects broader political, economic, or social changes within a country.

The city has undergone several name changes: it was originally named Akmolinsk, then Tselinograd, reverted to Akmolinsk, and later became known as Astana. In 2019, it was renamed Nur-Sultan in honor of the first President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, before reverting back to Astana. The city was designated as the capital of Kazakhstan in 1997, replacing Almaty, which was the previous capital.

The reasoning process should clarify the historical context of the city's name changes to provide a comprehensive understanding. \n\n1. **Historical Context**: The city was originally named Akmolinsk, then Tselinograd, and later Akmolinsk again. It was renamed Astana in 1998 when it became the capital of Kazakhstan, replacing Almaty. In 2019, the city was renamed Nur-Sultan in honor of the first President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev. However, there has been a recent trend to revert to the name Astana.\n\n2. **Current Name**: As of the latest information retrieved, the capital is referred to as Nursultan, but it is important to note that there may be discussions or movements regarding the name Astana.\n\n3. **Implications for the Model**: The model must be updated to reflect that the capital of Kazakhstan is currently known as Nursultan, while also acknowledging the historical significance of the name Astana and the possibility of its use in contemporary discourse.\n\nBy incorporating this nuanced understanding, the model can provide accurate and contextually relevant responses regarding the capital of Kazakhstan.\n\n**Answer**: The capital of Kazakhstan is currently known as Nursultan, having been previously named Astana."}], "question_info": {"question": "Astana is the capital of which country?", "passages": ["Nursultan, previously Astana, is the capital of Kazakhstan.\n", "Astana City\n", "Astana\n", "Astana\n", "Astana\n"], "__answers__": ["Kazakhstan", "Republic of Kazakhstan", "\u049b\u0430\u0437\u0430\u049b\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d \u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0441\u044b", "constitution day kazakhstan", "republic of kazakhstan", "Kazastan", "administrative divisions of kazakhstan", "khazahstan", "Kazakhistan", "KAZAKHSTAN", "kazhakstan", "khazakstan", "khazakstani", "kazahastan", "respublika kazakhstan", "\u049a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u049b\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0441\u044b", "kazakhia", "Khazakastan", "\u049b\u0440", "kazajastan", "Kazajastan", "Name of Kazakhstan", "\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d", "Kazakh Yeli", "qazaqstan respubl\u00efkas\u0131", "Respublika Kazakhstan", "kazahkstan", "ka3axctah", "\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d", "\u049a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u049b\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d", "Kazahkstan", "kazakh eli", "Khazahstan", "khazakastan", "etymology of kazakhstan", "Khazakhstan", "Kazakhia", "Public holidays in Kazakhstan", "KA3AKCTAH", "qazaqstan", "kazakhstan", "\u049b\u0430\u0437\u0430\u049b\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d", "\u0642\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0642\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646", "Administrative divisions of Kazakhstan", "day of capital", "KA3AXCTAH", "public holidays in kazakhstan", "\u049a\u0420", "kazachstan", "Kazakistan", "ka3akctah", "Kazakh Republic", "Qazaqstan Respubl\u00efkas\u0131", "kazakistan", "ISO 3166-1:KZ", "kazakh republic", "kazakhistan", "Etymology of Kazakhstan", "\u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d", "Constitution Day (Kazakhstan)", "Khazakstani", "kazakh yeli", "\u0642\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0642\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u06d5\u0633\u067e\u06cb\u0628\u0644\u0649\u064a\u0643\u0627\u0633\u0649", "name of kazakhstan", "kazastan", "kazahstan", "Kazahastan", "The Republic of Kazakhstan", "khazakhstan", "Kazhakstan", "\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d", "Day of the Capital", "\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d", "kazakstan", "Khazakstan", "Kazachstan", "Kazakh Eli", "Kazahstan", "Qazaqstan", "Kazakstan", "\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d", "iso 3166 1 kz"]}}
