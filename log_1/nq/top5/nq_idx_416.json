The National Film Festival is one of many such events, each with its own criteria and significance. Recognizing that the National Film Festival has its own unique history and prestige can help contextualize the importance of the Best Actor award.\n\n2. **Notable Winners and Trends**: Awards at film festivals often reflect trends in cinema and highlight performances that resonate with audiences and critics alike. For instance, Rajkummar Rao, who won the Best Actor award in 2017 for his role in \"Newton,\" is known for his ability to portray complex characters, which may have contributed to his recognition at this festival.\n\n3. **Cultural Context**: The National Film Festival, particularly in India, often emphasizes regional cinema and social issues. \"Newton,\" the film for which Rao won, addresses themes of democracy and the electoral process in India, making it particularly relevant in the cultural context of the time. Understanding the film's themes can provide insight into why Rao's performance was celebrated.\n\n4. **Diversity of Awards**: The existence of various categories (Best Actor, Best Actress, etc.) across different festivals indicates a broad recognition of talent in the film industry. This diversity highlights the competitive nature of the industry and the importance of individual performances in contributing to the overall narrative of cinema.\n\n5. **Global Recognition**: Film festivals are not only local events but also part of a global network that recognizes talent across borders. The recognition of actors like Rajkummar Rao at national festivals can lead to greater opportunities in international cinema, showcasing the interconnectedness of the film industry.\n\n### Answer:\nThe winner of the Best Actor award at the 64th National Film Festival in 2017 was Rajkummar Rao for his performance in the film \"Newton.\" This film, which addresses significant social themes, resonated with audiences and critics, highlighting Rao's talent and the cultural relevance of his role.
