The properties of HSS, such as its ability to retain sharp cutting edges and resist wear, make it particularly suitable for a variety of machining tasks.\n\n1. **Primary Use**: HSS is primarily utilized in the manufacture of cutting tools, including drills, taps, milling cutters, tool bits, gear cutters, saw blades, and router bits. This indicates that HSS is essential for operations that require effective cutting and shaping of materials, particularly metals.\n\n2. **Comparative Advantages**: \n   - HSS tools maintain their sharpness longer than carbon steel tools, which means they require less frequent sharpening. This characteristic is crucial for operations where tool longevity and consistent performance are critical.\n   - HSS is favored in woodturning due to the high speed of movement of the workpiece, which complements HSS's ability to hold its edge effectively under such conditions.\n\n3. **Limitations and Alternatives**: While HSS is widely used, it is increasingly being replaced by materials such as carbide, ceramic, and diamond tooling for specific applications. Carbide tools are noted for their durability and suitability for high production milling, while ceramics can withstand high temperatures, making them ideal for high-speed machining.
