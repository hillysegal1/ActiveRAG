It illustrates how energy and nutrients flow through different trophic levels.\n\n2. **Role of Fungi**: Fungi primarily act as decomposers in ecosystems. They break down dead organic matter, such as fallen leaves, dead plants, and animals, recycling nutrients back into the soil. This decomposition process is vital for nutrient cycling and maintaining soil health.\n\n3. **Position in the Food Web**: In a food web, fungi are categorized as decomposers. They do not fit neatly into the categories of producers (like plants) or consumers (like herbivores and carnivores).
