The term \"Revolutionary War\" can refer to different historical conflicts, but it is commonly associated with the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783). During this war, Spain was an ally of France against Great Britain, and while Spain did regain control of Florida as a result of the geopolitical shifts following the war, it is important to clarify that Florida had been ceded to Britain in 1763 and was returned to Spain in the Treaty of Paris (1783).\n\nHowever, it is also essential to note that the question could be misinterpreted, as it may imply the Spanish-American War (1898), which resulted in Spain losing its colonies, such as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, to the United States. Therefore, the context of the question should be specified to avoid confusion.\n\nTo enhance the model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, the following points should be emphasized:\n\n1. The American Revolutionary War did lead to Spain regaining Florida, which had been ceded to Britain earlier.\n2. The term \"Revolutionary War\" should be clearly defined to avoid ambiguity, as it could refer to multiple conflicts.\n3. The Spanish-American War (1898) is a separate event that resulted in Spain losing its territories rather than regaining any.\n\nGiven this enhanced understanding, the answer to the question is:\n\n**Answer:** Florida was returned to Spain after the American Revolutionary War as part of the Treaty of Paris (1783)."}], "question_info": {"question": "which state was returned to spain after the revolutionary war", "passages": ["In 1974 the dictatorship of the \"Estado Novo\" was brought to an end by a military \"coup\" known as the Carnation Revolution.
