However, this was not a majority, as it fell short of the required 131 votes.\n\n2. **House of Representatives Decision**: Since no candidate achieved a majority, the election was decided by the House of Representatives, which ultimately selected John Quincy Adams as president. This highlights the importance of understanding the electoral process and its implications when a majority is not reached.\n\n3. **Electoral Dynamics**: The presence of multiple candidates from the same party (the Democratic-Republican Party) contributed to the fragmentation of electoral votes. This situation illustrates how competition among candidates can lead to a scenario where one candidate can have the most votes without achieving a majority.\n\n4. **Legislative Appointment of Electors**: In 1824, six states appointed their electors through legislative means rather than popular vote. This factor adds complexity to the electoral dynamics and emphasizes the variability in how electors were chosen, which can affect the overall electoral outcome.\n\n5. **Uncertainty of National Popular Vote**: The uncertainty surrounding the national popular vote in 1824 is significant. The lack of a clear popular vote outcome complicates the interpretation of electoral results and highlights the need for careful analysis when evaluating electoral processes.\n\n### Enhanced Reasoning:\nBy synthesizing the above points, we can enhance our understanding of the 1824 election. The distinction between plurality and majority is crucial, as it informs us about the electoral mechanics at play. The legislative appointment of electors and the presence of multiple candidates illustrate how electoral systems can lead to unexpected outcomes. Recognizing these dynamics allows for a deeper analysis of electoral processes and their implications for democracy.\n\n### Answer:\nAndrew Jackson received the most electoral votes in the 1824 election, with a total of 99 votes, but he did not secure a majority, which required at least 131 votes.
