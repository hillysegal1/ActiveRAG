The presence of a sponge cake base suggests that they have cake-like qualities, which is a critical factor in their classification.\n\n2. **Texture**: The texture of Jaffa Cakes is soft and spongy, akin to that of a cake. This contrasts with the typical crunchiness associated with biscuits, further supporting the argument that they are more cake-like.\n\n3. **Legal Definitions**: A notable legal case in the UK addressed the classification of Jaffa Cakes for tax purposes. The court ruled that they are cakes because they harden upon cooling, a characteristic that distinguishes cakes from biscuits, which generally become softer. This legal precedent adds a significant layer to the classification debate.\n\n4. **Size and Shape**: Jaffa Cakes are round and typically larger than most biscuits. Their size and shape contribute to their perception as cakes rather than biscuits, as biscuits are usually smaller and flatter.\n\n5. **Cultural Perception**: Jaffa Cakes are particularly popular in the UK and Ireland, where they are often marketed and consumed as snacks. This cultural context may influence how they are classified and perceived by consumers, potentially leading to a more biscuit-like categorization in everyday language.\n\n6. **Historical Context**: Introduced by McVitie and Price in 1927, the historical marketing and naming of Jaffa Cakes may have been designed to align them with consumer expectations of snacks, further complicating their classification.\n\n### Contextual Relationships:\n\nThe classification of Jaffa Cakes as either a biscuit or a cake is multifaceted.

They are made from cake ingredients and have a cake-like texture, yet they are often treated as biscuits in practical terms due to their size and consumption context. The legal classification as cakes adds complexity to the discussion.
