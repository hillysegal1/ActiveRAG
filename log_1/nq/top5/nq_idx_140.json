This information is crucial for understanding the physical characteristics of the region.\n\n4. **Distance from Open Sea**: The South Pole is about 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from the nearest open sea at the Bay of Whales, which can influence climate and ecological conditions in the area.\n\n5. **Permanent Research Station**: The United States Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station, established in 1956 and permanently staffed, indicates ongoing scientific research and human activity in this extreme environment.\n\n6. **Distinct from Magnetic Pole**: The Geographic South Pole is distinct from the South Magnetic Pole, which is defined based on Earth's magnetic field. This distinction is important for navigation and understanding Earth's magnetic properties.\n\n7. **Axis of Rotation**: The South Pole is one of the two points where Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface. This fact is significant for understanding global geography, time zones, and the effects of Earth's tilt on seasonal changes.\n\n8. **Climate and Environmental Implications**: The unique characteristics of the South Pole, including its elevation, ice thickness, and distance from the ocean, allow for inferences about climate change impacts, such as melting ice and rising sea levels, as well as their effects on global ocean currents and ecosystems.\n\n### Answer:\nThe South Pole is located at 90 degrees south latitude, making it the southernmost point on Earth. It is situated on the continent of Antarctica, specifically on the polar plateau, and is typically represented at the bottom center of a polar projection map or at the bottom of a standard world map near Antarctica. The South Pole is at an elevation of 2,835 meters (9,300 feet) above sea level, with an ice sheet approximately 2,700 meters (8,858 feet) thick, and is about 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from the nearest open sea at the Bay of Whales. Additionally, it hosts the United States Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station, established in 1956, which indicates ongoing scientific research in this extreme environment.
