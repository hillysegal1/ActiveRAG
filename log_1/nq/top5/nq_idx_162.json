The painting was stolen by an Italian handyman named Vincenzo Peruggia. Peruggia had previously worked at the Louvre and was familiar with the museum's layout.

On August 21, 1911, he hid inside the museum overnight and took the painting the next day. The theft went unnoticed for over 24 hours, and it wasn't until the following day that the museum realized the painting was missing.
