The term \"cuota\" translates to \"toll\" in English and is often used interchangeably with \"autopista\" in the context of toll roads. These toll roads are built and funded by federal taxes and are constructed to standards nearly identical to those of the US Interstate Highways System, ensuring a high level of quality and safety.\n\nAdditionally, many states in Mexico, such as Puebla, Veracruz, and Nuevo Le\u00f3n, have their own toll roads, indicating a decentralized approach to toll road management. This structure allows for a variety of toll roads that may serve different regional needs.\n\nThe numbering system for highways in Mexico is also noteworthy: odd numbers are assigned to north-south routes, while even numbers are assigned to east-west routes. Toll expressways are designated with a \"D\" suffix (for \"Directo\") added to the highway number, which helps differentiate them from free roads. For example, the highway connecting Mexico City and Puebla is designated as MX 150, while the toll expressway is MX 150D.\n\nToll roads in Mexico often serve multiple purposes, including acting as bypasses, crossing major bridges, and providing direct intercity connections. This contextual understanding of the role of toll roads can enhance the model's knowledge of transportation infrastructure in Mexico.\n\nBy integrating these insights, the model can improve its accuracy regarding the terminology, structure, and characteristics of toll roads in Mexico, thereby reducing the likelihood of model illusions and enhancing its overall knowledge base.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe toll roads in Mexico are commonly referred to as \"autopistas.\" They are also known as \"cuotas,\" which translates to \"toll\" in English.
