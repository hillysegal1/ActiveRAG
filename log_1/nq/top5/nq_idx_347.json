This event marked the beginning of the end for the division, leading to the eventual reunification of Germany on **October 3, 1990**.\n\n4. **Causal Relationships**: The construction of the wall was a reaction to the socio-political climate of the time, while its opening was influenced by a series of revolutions in Eastern Europe, public sentiment for freedom, and political reform pressures within East Germany.\n\n5. **Broader Implications**: The fall of the Berlin Wall is often viewed as a pivotal moment in the history of the Cold War, symbolizing the collapse of communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the triumph of democratic movements.\n\nBy integrating this knowledge, the model can better understand the causal relationships and historical significance of the Berlin Wall, enhancing its ability to reason about similar events in history.\n\n### Answer:\nThe wall went up in East Germany on **August 13, 1961**."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhen did the wall go up in east germany\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['On 18 October, Erich Honecker was forced to resign as head of the SED and as head of state and was replaced by Egon Krenz.
