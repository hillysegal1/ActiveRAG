The construction of the railway began in the 1880s, specifically in 1881. The project was crucial for the economic development of Canada and played a vital role in the country's expansion westward. The railway was completed in 1885, with the last spike being driven in at Craigellachie, British Columbia, on November 7, 1885.

This marks the formal establishment of the company responsible for the railway's construction.\n  \n2. **Construction Start**: Contrary to the initial inference that construction began in 1881, it actually commenced earlier, in June 1875, at Fort William, Ontario.

This event is a significant milestone, symbolizing the completion of Canada's first transcontinental railway.\n\n### Contradictory Information:\nThe original reasoning incorrectly stated that construction began in 1881, which is inaccurate. The correct start date is June 1875. This discrepancy highlights the importance of precise historical details in understanding the timeline of the CPR.\n\n### Information to Update the Model's Knowledge:\n- The model must be updated to reflect that construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway began in June 1875, not 1881.\n- The incorporation date (1881) and completion date (1885) should also be retained for a comprehensive understanding of the railway's history.\n\n### Summary:\nTo enhance the model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, it is essential to incorporate the accurate start date of construction (June 1875) into the model's knowledge base, alongside the incorporation date (1881) and completion date (1885).
