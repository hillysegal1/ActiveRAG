The nuclear model of the atom is a significant advancement in atomic theory, which describes the atom as having a dense central nucleus surrounded by electrons.\n2. This model was proposed after the discovery of the nucleus, which was a result of experiments conducted by scientists in the early 20th century.\n3. One of the key experiments that led to the development of the nuclear model was the gold foil experiment conducted by Ernest Rutherford in 1909.\n4.
