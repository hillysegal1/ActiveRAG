Agent Matthews, portrayed by Benjamin Bratt, was a significant character in the first film, serving as Gracie's love interest and a fellow FBI agent.\n\n2. **Consider the Plot of the Sequel**: The sequel shifts its focus primarily to Gracie Hart as she navigates her newfound celebrity status and continues her work as an FBI agent. The narrative introduces new characters, such as those played by Regina King, which may have contributed to the decision to exclude Agent Matthews.\n\n3. **Analyze Character Development**: The absence of Agent Matthews could be attributed to the filmmakers' decision to concentrate on Gracie's character development and her evolving challenges. The sequel's plot may not have necessitated the inclusion of Agent Matthews, as the story could have been designed to explore Gracie's independence and growth without relying on her previous relationships.\n\n4. **Production Decisions**: There are often practical reasons for character absences in sequels, such as actor availability or creative choices.
