The first seven \"w\u0101\" fall under \"p\u014d\" (darkness), indicating a primordial state where spiritual and non-physical events occur. This division is crucial for understanding the progression of creation.\n\n2. **Creation of Life**: The Kumulipo narrates the gradual emergence of life, beginning with simpler forms and progressing to more complex organisms, including plants, animals, and eventually mammals. This progression suggests that human beings are the culmination of a long evolutionary and spiritual journey.\n\n3. **Human Creation Context**: The creation of human beings is specifically highlighted in the later \"w\u0101.\" The narrative emphasizes the significance of the union between Kii (the man) and Lailai (the woman), which occurs before the god K\u0101ne can intervene.

The first seven \"w\u0101\" are associated with \"p\u014d\" (darkness), representing the age of spirit, while the remaining sections correspond to \"ao\" (day), which relates to the emergence of mankind.\n\n2. **Creation of Humans**: The creation of human beings occurs in the context of the later \"w\u0101.\" Specifically, it is noted that after the birth of \"Lailai\" (the woman) and \"Kii\" (the man), Kii successfully reproduces with Lailai. This event signifies the transition from divine beings to human beings, indicating that humans are created in the context of divine lineage.\n\n3. **Symbolism and Transformation**: The narrative illustrates a significant transformation where humans evolve from being symbols of the gods to becoming the keepers of these symbols. This shift emphasizes the evolving relationship between humanity and divinity, which is crucial for understanding the cultural significance of the narrative.\n\n4. **Causal Relationships**: The successful reproduction of Kii with Lailai before the god K\u0101ne is a pivotal causal event that establishes the lineage of humanity.
