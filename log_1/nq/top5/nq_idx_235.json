This distinction is essential for understanding the context of settlement in the U.S.\n\n2. **Early European Exploration**: The first significant non-native presence in the Americas came from Spanish explorers, who arrived as early as the late 15th century. Notable figures include Christopher Columbus, who landed in 1492, and later explorers like Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n, who established a settlement in Florida.\n\n3. **Spanish Settlements**: The Spanish were the first to establish settlements in what is now the United States, particularly in Florida and the Southwest. Their presence included missions and forts, which laid the groundwork for future colonization.\n\n4. **English Colonization**: The English established their first permanent settlement at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. This marked the beginning of a more sustained English presence in North America, which would grow significantly in the following decades.\n\n5. **French Influence**: The French also played a role in early American settlement, particularly in Canada and along the Mississippi River. However, their settlements in what is now the U.S. were not as early or extensive as those of the Spanish or English.\n\n6. **Yankee Settlers**: In the 19th century, a new wave of non-native settlers, known as \"Yankee\" settlers, emerged, primarily from New England. These settlers were descendants of English Puritans and were influenced by the Second Great Awakening, which shaped their religious and social values.\n\n7. **Impact of the Black Hawk War and the Erie Canal**: The conclusion of the Black Hawk War in 1832 and the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825 were pivotal events that facilitated further settlement in the Midwest. These developments opened new territories for non-native settlers, particularly those from New England.\n\n8. **Demographic Changes**: The influx of immigrants from various European countries, such as Germany and Ireland in the late 19th century, reflects the evolving nature of American society and the multicultural aspects of its development.\n\n9. **Complex Interactions**: The presence of African Americans, including runaway slaves who found refuge among the Seminoles in Spanish Florida, adds complexity to the narrative of settlement. Understanding these interactions is crucial for a comprehensive view of early American history.\n\n### Answer:\nThe first non-native settlers in what is now the United States were Spanish explorers and settlers, who established a presence in Florida and the Southwest in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Following them, the English established their first permanent settlement at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. In the 19th century, a new wave of non-native settlers, known as \"Yankee\" settlers from New England, began to migrate westward, influenced by events such as the Black Hawk War and the completion of the Erie Canal.

This includes various European groups who established settlements in North America.\n\n3. **Historical Context**:\n   - The first significant non-native presence in what is now the U.S. can be traced back to Spanish explorers and settlers in the early 16th century, notably with Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n's arrival in Florida in 1513.\n   - Following the Spanish, the English established their first permanent settlement at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607, marking the beginning of sustained English colonization.\n\n4. **Subsequent Settlements**:\n   - The French also played a role in early non-native settlement, particularly in Canada and along the Mississippi River, but their influence in the present-day U.S. was less pronounced than that of the Spanish and English.\n\n5. **Regional Settlements**:\n   - In the 19th century, particularly around 1835, a new wave of non-native settlers, primarily from New England, began arriving in various regions of the U.S. These settlers, known as \"Yankee\" settlers, were influenced by events such as the end of the Black Hawk War and the completion of the Erie Canal.\n\n6. **Demographic and Cultural Influences**:\n   - The early settlers were predominantly of English Puritan descent and were primarily members of the Congregational Church, with many converting to other denominations due to the Second Great Awakening. This reflects the cultural and religious dynamics of the time.\n\n7. **Environmental Context**:\n   - The arrival of these settlers often transformed the landscape, as they encountered and altered dense forests and wild prairies, leading to significant ecological changes.\n\n8. **Long-term Implications**:\n   - Understanding these early migrations helps contextualize the demographic shifts and cultural transformations that occurred in the U.S., paving the way for future waves of immigration from various regions, including Germany and Ireland in the late 19th century.\n\n### Answer:\nThe first non-native settlers in the U.S. were Spanish explorers and settlers, with Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n being one of the earliest in 1513. Following them, English settlers established a permanent presence with the founding of Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607.
