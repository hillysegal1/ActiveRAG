According to Joel Goldstein, a legal professor and the author of several works on the vice presidency, 1976 marked the beginning of the modern vice presidential selection process, with candidates undergoing extensive vetting. Carter thought that the vice president could be an important asset for a president, and Mondale became a major part of Carter's campaign.
