Historical records and scholarly research indicate that the play was likely written in the late 1590s, with many sources suggesting that it was first performed in 1599. However, the exact date of the first performance is not definitively recorded, and some scholars also propose that it could have been performed in 1600.\n\nUpon reviewing the retrieved passages, it is clear that they focus on various later productions of \"As You Like It,\" including performances from the 1950s to the 21st century. Notably, these passages do not provide any information about the original performance date, which is essential for establishing the historical context of the play.\n\nTo enhance the reasoning process, we can incorporate the widely accepted historical consensus that \"As You Like It\" was likely first performed in 1599 or 1600. This information should be emphasized to ensure that the model does not mistakenly prioritize the more recent performance dates mentioned in the passages.\n\nTherefore, the enhanced reasoning process would include:\n1. Acknowledgment of the play's authorship and its historical context.\n2. Recognition of the lack of specific information in the retrieved passages regarding the original performance date.\n3. Reinforcement of the accepted scholarly view that the play was likely first performed in 1599 or 1600.\n\n**Answer:**\n\"As You Like It\" was likely first performed in 1599 or 1600."}], "question_info": {"question": "when was as you like it first performed", "passages": ["BULLET::::- 17 Feb 1953 \"As You Like It\" Mercury Theatre (Leila Blake)\n", "BULLET::::- \"As You Like It\", Nottingham and Edinburgh production: opening production at Riverside Studios, 30 May 1976\n", "BULLET::::- \"As You Like It\" - 1959, 1972, 1977, 1978, 1983, 1987, 1990, 1996, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2016\n", "BULLET::::- \"As You Like It\" (1977) \u2013 Musical Stager\n", "BULLET::::- \"As You Like It\" (21 June 2005 \u2013 17 September 2005) by William Shakespeare, starring Sienna Miller and Clive Rowe\n"], "__answers__": ["1603", "uncertain , though a performance at Wilton House in 1603 has been suggested as a possibility"]}}
