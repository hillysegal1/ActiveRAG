It is important to identify its geographical and geological significance.\n\n2. **Geographical location**: Loihi is located off the southeastern coast of the Big Island of Hawaii. This positioning is crucial as it places Loihi within the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, which is a series of underwater mountains formed by volcanic activity associated with the Hawaiian hotspot.\n\n3. **Volcanic activity**: Loihi is an active volcano, and it is currently in the process of forming. It is the youngest volcano in the Hawaiian chain and is still submerged beneath the ocean surface. Understanding its volcanic nature helps clarify its origin.\n\n4. **Formation process**: The origin of Loihi can be traced back to the Hawaiian hotspot, a plume of hot material rising from deep within the Earth\u2019s mantle.
