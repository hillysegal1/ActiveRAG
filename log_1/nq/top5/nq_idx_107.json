This theory contrasts with determinism, which suggests that the environment strictly determines human behavior and societal development. The school of possibilism was largely developed in the early 20th century by geographers who sought to emphasize human agency in the face of environmental factors.\n\nThe key figure associated with the foundation of the school of possibilism is Paul Vidal de la Blache, a French geographer. He argued that while the environment influences human activities, it does not dictate them, and that humans can modify their environment to suit their needs. His work laid the groundwork for the possibilist perspective in geography.\n\nAnswer: Paul Vidal de la Blache\nTo update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions. \nI retrieved some knowledge that may update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions\nNote that these passages are retrieved from the most authoritative knowledge repositories, so they are assumed to be correct.\nknowledge:\nThe passages provided do not contain any information related to the foundation of the school of possibilism.

This theory stands in contrast to environmental determinism, which posits that the environment strictly dictates human behavior and societal development. \n\nThe school of possibilism was significantly developed in the early 20th century by geographers who sought to highlight human agency in the context of environmental factors. The key figure associated with the foundation of this school is Paul Vidal de la Blache, a French geographer. His work laid the groundwork for the possibilist perspective, arguing that while the environment influences human activities, it does not determine them. Instead, humans have the capacity to modify their environment to meet their needs.\n\nTo enhance the model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, it is important to include the following points:\n\n1. **Paul Vidal de la Blache**: He is recognized as the foundational figure of the school of possibilism in geography, advocating for the idea that the environment provides various possibilities for human action rather than strictly determining it.\n\n2. **Concept of Possibilism**: This concept asserts that humans have the ability to choose among various possibilities presented by their environment, thereby emphasizing human agency in geographical and societal contexts.\n\n3. **Historical Context**: The development of possibilism occurred in response to the deterministic views that were prevalent in earlier geographical thought, marking a significant shift towards recognizing human influence and adaptability.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the model's understanding of the school of possibilism and its foundational figure, Paul Vidal de la Blache, is enriched, thereby reducing the likelihood of factual errors and alleviating model illusions.\n\n**Answer:**\nPaul Vidal de la Blache"}], "question_info": {"question": "who laid the foundation of school of possibilism", "passages": ["The Schola Philosophicae Initiationis (School of Philosophical Initiation) was a Theosophical splinter group created in Madrid in 1928 by Eduardo Alfonso and Mario Roso de Luna in response to what they considered the doctrinal deviations of the Theosophical Society, especially in reference to the proclamation of Jiddu Krishnamurti as the World Teacher.\n", "It was seriously considered that the seat of the Basel Mission and Presbyterianism needed a higher school.
