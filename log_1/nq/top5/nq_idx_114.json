The DHS was established in 2003, and its leadership has changed with different presidential administrations. In 2017, Donald Trump was the President of the United States, having taken office in January of that year.\n\nThe Secretary of Homeland Security is the head of the DHS. Initially, **John F.

After that, **Elaine Duke** served as the Acting Secretary until **Kirstjen Nielsen** took over in December.\n\nThis enhanced reasoning process clarifies the timeline of leadership within the Department of Homeland Security for the year 2017, specifically identifying John F.
