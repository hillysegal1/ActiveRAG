On November 23, 1996, the flight was hijacked by three Ethiopian men seeking political asylum in Australia. This context is crucial as it reflects the political turmoil in Ethiopia during the 1990s, which may have driven individuals to desperate measures such as hijacking an aircraft.\n\nThe aircraft involved was a Boeing 767-200ER, a model known for its capacity and range, which is relevant when discussing the operational challenges faced during the hijacking. After the hijacking, the plane was forced to fly for several hours, during which the hijackers struggled with the crew, ultimately leading to a critical situation where the aircraft ran out of fuel.\n\nThe crash occurred in the Indian Ocean near the Comoros Islands, a location that posed significant challenges for the pilots attempting to land the aircraft safely. The decision-making process of the pilot is particularly noteworthy; despite the initial intention to land at an airport, the lack of fuel forced a ditching attempt in the ocean. This highlights the intense pressure and critical thinking required in emergency situations.\n\nThe incident resulted in the tragic loss of 125 lives out of 175 passengers and crew, including the three hijackers. This statistic underscores the human impact of aviation incidents and serves as a reminder of the stakes involved in such crises. The event also raised significant concerns regarding aviation security and the measures needed to prevent similar hijackings in the future.\n\nIn summary, understanding the socio-political context, the technical aspects of the aircraft, the geographical challenges, and the human toll of the incident provides a comprehensive view of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961.

After approximately **three hours** of flight, the aircraft ran out of fuel, which forced the pilot to attempt a ditching in the **Indian Ocean near the Comoros Islands**.\n\nThe crash resulted in the tragic loss of **125 out of 175** passengers and crew members, including the hijackers. This incident underscored significant issues related to aviation security and the inherent dangers of hijacking. The pilot's decision-making was severely constrained by the circumstances, as the initial plan to land at an airport was thwarted by the lack of fuel, illustrating how external pressures can dictate critical choices in crisis situations.\n\n### Enhanced Causal Reasoning and Logical Inference:\n1. **Causal Relationships**: The hijacking directly led to a series of events that culminated in the crash. The model can learn to identify how the hijacking initiated a chain reaction of events, including fuel depletion and the pilot's constrained decision-making.\n\n2. **Temporal Sequence**: The clear timeline of events (hijacking, flight duration, fuel depletion, crash) allows the model to infer the order of occurrences and their interdependencies, which is crucial for constructing coherent narratives.\n\n3. **Decision-Making Under Pressure**: The pilot's struggle to manage the crisis under extreme duress can enhance the model's understanding of how external factors influence decision-making in high-stakes scenarios.\n\n4. **Statistical Analysis**: The casualty figures provide a basis for understanding risk assessment and the implications of hijacking on survival rates, allowing the model to make inferences about the likelihood of various outcomes based on given conditions.\n\n5. **Contextual Complexity**: The motivations of the hijackers seeking political asylum add depth to the model's understanding of human behavior in crisis situations, enhancing its ability to reason about complex social dynamics.\n\nBy integrating these elements, the model can develop a more nuanced understanding of causality, improve its logical inference capabilities, and better analyze complex scenarios involving human actions and their consequences.\n\n### Answer:\nEthiopian Airlines Flight 961 crashed into the Indian Ocean on November 23, 1996, after being hijacked by three Ethiopians seeking political asylum. The aircraft, a Boeing 767-200ER, ran out of fuel after approximately three hours of flight, leading to a crash that resulted in the deaths of 125 out of 175 passengers and crew members.
