Stephanie Forrester, a central character, is known for her strong personality and complex family dynamics. Throughout the series, her relationships with her children and other characters are explored, but her own mother is less frequently mentioned.\n\nThe retrieved passages provide some insights into Stephanie Forrester's character but do not explicitly mention her mother's name or background. The bullet point referring to \"Anna \u0160i\u0161kov\u00e1 as Stephanie's mother\" does not clarify that this is related to \"The Bold and the Beautiful,\" which could lead to confusion regarding her mother's identity. \n\nAdditionally, the passages indicate that Stephanie's mother is not a prominent character in the storyline, and her name is not commonly referenced.
