In its early years, particularly during the late 1930s and 1940s, it attracted the best teams, as evidenced by Long Island University's choice to compete in the NIT over the first NCAA tournament in 1939.\n\n2. **Ambiguity and Competition**: Throughout the 1940s, both tournaments competed for recognition, leading to confusion over which was the definitive championship. This period saw teams claiming national titles from both tournaments, indicating a lack of clarity regarding their relative importance.\n\n3. **Turning Point in the 1950s**: The early 1950s marked a critical transition. In 1950, the NCAA implemented a rule preventing teams from participating in both tournaments, effectively steering the best teams toward the NCAA. This decision began to consolidate the NCAA's status as the primary tournament.\n\n4. **Impact of Scandals**: The 1951 gambling and point-shaving scandals further shifted the landscape. The NCAA tournament emerged from these scandals with increased credibility, while the NIT's reputation suffered. As a result, more top-ranked teams began to participate in the NCAA tournament, enhancing its prestige.\n\n5. **Formal Recognition and Expansion**: By the late 1950s and into the 1960s, the NCAA tournament had overtaken the NIT in terms of prestige. The NCAA's expansion of the tournament field in the 1970s further solidified its status, making it synonymous with the national championship. The NIT's status continued to decline during this period.\n\n6. **Cultural Phenomenon**: By the late 1980s and early 1990s, the NCAA tournament had firmly established itself as the main event in college basketball, overshadowing the NIT. This trend continued into the 2000s, as the NCAA tournament became a cultural phenomenon, drawing millions of viewers and generating significant revenue.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the NCAA tournament began to surpass the NIT in importance in the early 1950s, particularly after the 1951 scandals and the NCAA's strategic decisions. By 1960, it was widely recognized as the more prestigious tournament, a status that was solidified through continued expansion and the participation of top teams. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, the NCAA tournament had firmly established itself as the dominant postseason event in college basketball.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe NCAA tournament became more important than the NIT primarily in the early 1950s, with a significant shift occurring after the 1951 scandals.

The NIT's dominance was particularly evident in the late 1930s and early 1940s. However, several key developments contributed to the NCAA Tournament's rise in importance over the NIT.\n\n1. **Initial Prestige and Competition**:\n   - The NIT was the premier tournament until the NCAA Tournament's inception. In the early years, teams often chose to compete in the NIT due to its higher status.\n\n2. **Changing Perceptions**:\n   - By 1945, media sources began to suggest that the NCAA Tournament involved stronger competition. This shift in perception was crucial as it laid the groundwork for the NCAA's growing prestige.\n\n3. **Impact of Scandals**:\n   - The 1951 gambling and point-shaving scandals severely damaged the NIT's reputation. The NCAA Tournament capitalized on this situation, attracting more top teams and enhancing its own prestige.\n\n4. **Regulatory Changes**:\n   - In the mid-1950s, the NCAA implemented rules that favored its tournament, such as requiring teams to choose between the NCAA and NIT. This effectively directed more talent and attention to the NCAA Tournament.\n\n5. **Expansion and Popularity**:\n   - The NCAA Tournament expanded its field over the years, increasing from 25 teams in 1975 to 68 teams in 2011. This expansion allowed for greater participation from top-ranked teams, further solidifying its status as the premier tournament.\n\n6. **Final Shift in Dominance**:\n   - By 1960, the NCAA Tournament had overtaken the NIT in terms of prestige and importance. It became the sole determiner of the national champion, cementing its role as the main event in college basketball.\n\n7. **Cultural Phenomenon**:\n   - By the late 1980s and early 1990s, the NCAA Tournament had firmly established itself as a cultural phenomenon, drawing millions of viewers and generating significant revenue, which further distanced it from the NIT.\n\nIn summary, the NCAA Tournament's rise to prominence over the NIT can be attributed to a combination of changing perceptions, the impact of scandals, regulatory changes, and strategic expansions. These factors collectively contributed to the NCAA Tournament becoming the primary postseason event in college basketball.\n\n### Answer:\nThe NCAA Tournament became more important than the NIT by the late 1950s and was firmly established as the premier college basketball tournament by the late 1980s and early 1990s."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhen did the ncaa tournament became more important than the nit\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['During the early years of the two tournaments, the NCAA and NIT competed against each other, giving rise to debate over their relative prowess.
