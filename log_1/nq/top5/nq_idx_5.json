Pearls are formed within the shells of certain mollusks, primarily oysters. The process of pearl formation occurs when an irritant, such as a grain of sand, enters the shell, and the oyster secretes layers of nacre around it.\n2. In India, pearls are primarily found in the coastal regions where oyster beds are present. The most notable areas for pearl cultivation and harvesting are in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal.\n3.
