The song is celebrated for its energetic and danceable quality, which may lead to the phrase \"come and dance with me\" being associated with it in a general sense, but it is not a direct quote from the song.\n\n2. **Understanding \"Come Dance with Me\"**: The phrase \"come and dance with me\" is more closely aligned with the song \"Come Dance with Me,\" written by Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn. This song is separate from \"Jai Ho\" and does not have any direct connection to it.\n\n3. **Contradictory Information**: The original reasoning conflates the two songs without clarifying that \"come and dance with me\" is not a lyric from \"Jai Ho.\" The passages retrieved confirm that \"Come Dance with Me\" is a distinct song by different artists and does not relate to \"Jai Ho.\"\n\n4. **Updating the Model's Knowledge**: To prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions, the model should be updated with the following:\n   - \"Jai Ho\" is a song from \"Slumdog Millionaire,\" composed by A.R. Rahman, featuring vocals by Sukhwinder Singh and others.\n   - \"Come Dance with Me\" is a separate song by Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn, and the phrase \"come and dance with me\" does not appear in \"Jai Ho.\"\n\nBy incorporating this information, the model can better differentiate between these two songs and avoid inaccuracies in future responses.\n\n### Answer:\nThe song \"Jai Ho\" is sung by A.R. Rahman, featuring vocals by Sukhwinder Singh and others. The phrase \"come and dance with me\" is not a lyric from \"Jai Ho\" but is associated with the separate song \"Come Dance with Me,\" written by Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn."}], "question_info": {"question": "who sings so come and dance with me jai ho", "passages": ["Come Sing, Jimmy Jo\n", "BULLET::::- \"Come Dance with Me\" (song), 1959 song by Jimmy Van Heusen\n", "BULLET::::2. \"Come Dance with Me\" (Sammy Cahn, Jimmy Van Heusen)\u00a0\u2013 2:22\n", "BULLET::::- \"Come Sing, Jimmy Jo\", 1985.\n", "Come Dance with Me (song)\n"], "__answers__": ["Sukhvinder Singh", "Mahalaxmi Iyer", "Vijay Prakash", "Tanvi Shah"]}}
