For instance, Los Angeles will be the third city to host the Olympics three times, which may influence perceptions of its capability to host again.\n\n### Answer:\nThe next Olympics will be held in Paris, France, in 2024. Following that, the 2028 Summer Olympics will take place in Los Angeles, California. This sequence reflects the established Olympic cycle and the historical significance of the host cities."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhere will be the next olympics be held\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n[\"This first ever question for the live audience was, 'Where will the next Olympic games be held (1980)?'.
