This system was widely adopted in the 19th century.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: The United States officially adopted the gold standard in the 19th century, but it faced challenges during economic crises, particularly during the Great Depression in the 1930s. The economic turmoil created pressure to abandon the gold standard to allow for more flexible monetary policy.\n\n3. **Domestic Abandonment**: On April 19, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt took decisive action to abandon the gold standard domestically. This included prohibiting private ownership of gold and mandating that citizens exchange their gold coins, bullion, and certificates for U.S. dollars. This marked a significant shift in monetary policy aimed at combating deflation and stimulating the economy.\n\n4. **Legal Changes**: Following the domestic abandonment, gold was no longer considered legal tender for debts in private and public contracts. This allowed the U.S. dollar to float freely on foreign exchange markets, which was a crucial step in transitioning to a more flexible monetary system.\n\n5. **Gold Reserve Act**: In January 1934, the Gold Reserve Act was passed, which fixed the dollar at a lower value in terms of gold. This act formalized the abandonment of the gold standard and established a new monetary framework.\n\n6. **International Context**: The Bretton Woods Agreement, established in 1944, initially allowed for the U.S. dollar to be convertible to gold for foreign governments and central banks. However, this convertibility was unilaterally canceled by President Richard Nixon in 1971 during an event known as the \"Nixon Shock.\" This marked the definitive end of the gold standard for international transactions and transitioned the U.S. to a fiat currency system.\n\n7. **Causal Relationships**: The reasoning process highlights the causal relationship between economic crises (like the Great Depression) and significant policy changes (like abandoning the gold standard). It also emphasizes the temporal sequence of events leading to the final abandonment of the gold standard in 1971.\n\n8. **Interconnectedness of Policies**: The model can recognize how domestic monetary policy decisions are interconnected with international monetary systems, enhancing its ability to infer broader economic implications.\n\n### Answer:\nThe U.S. dollar officially left the gold standard domestically on April 19, 1933, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt prohibited private ownership of gold and required citizens to exchange their gold for U.S. dollars. However, the dollar remained convertible to gold for foreign governments and central banks until 1971, when President Richard Nixon announced the suspension of this convertibility, marking the definitive end of the gold standard for international transactions.
