This timeframe is essential for understanding the context of the production.\n\n2. **Primary Filming Locations**: \n   - The first scenes were shot near Page, Arizona, which provided the rugged and desolate landscapes necessary for the film's setting.\n   - Notably, Horseshoe Bend on the Colorado River was used to represent the Forbidden Zone, a critical location in the film's narrative.\n\n3. **California's Role**: While the original inference mentioned California as a filming location, it is important to specify that while some scenes may have been shot in California, the primary and most significant locations were in Arizona. This distinction is crucial for accuracy.\n\n4. **Logistical Considerations**: The production involved moving an entire setup into a desert environment, indicating significant logistical planning. Understanding these logistical challenges can help infer why certain locations were chosen based on their accessibility and suitability for filming.\n\n5. **Influence on Remake**: The knowledge that the remake also filmed at Lake Powell, where parts of the original were shot, suggests a continuity in location choice that reflects the visual and thematic elements of the story.\n\nBy synthesizing this information, I can conclude that the original film's choice of locations was influenced by the need for specific environmental characteristics that matched the film's narrative.\n\n### Answer:\nThe original \"Planet of the Apes\" was primarily filmed near Page, Arizona, with significant scenes shot at Horseshoe Bend on the Colorado River, which represented the Forbidden Zone in the film. While some filming may have occurred in California, the key locations that defined the film's setting were in Arizona."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhere was the original planet of the apes filmed at\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['A brief scene from Planet of the apes movie remake was shot on the barren landscape of shanmaghery.
