However, the passages provided indicate that specific properties associated with the Crowne Plaza brand have undergone multiple ownership changes.\n\n1. **Ownership Changes**:\n   - The Crowne Plaza brand itself is owned by IHG, but specific hotels operating under this brand may have different owners. For instance, the hotel building mentioned in the passages was sold to **EOS DCH Owner LLC** in **September 2017**, and it subsequently disassociated from the Crowne Plaza brand.\n   - Prior to that, in **mid-2010**, **Hargate Properties** acquired a Crowne Plaza hotel, which later went into receivership in **November 2011**.\n   - The **Crowne Plaza Cleveland City Centre hotel** was acquired by **Optima Ventures** and **Sage Hospitality Resources** in **October 2011**.\n   - In **June 2015**, the building was sold to **Andrew \u201cAvi\u201d Greenbaum**, principal of **Hudson Holdings**.\n\n2. **Brand Affiliation**:\n   - The Crowne Plaza brand has experienced changes in affiliation due to ownership transitions. The model should recognize that while IHG owns the brand, individual properties may change hands and may or may not continue to operate under the Crowne Plaza name.\n\n3. **Temporal Relationships**:\n   - The timeline of ownership changes illustrates how the operational status of a hotel can shift based on ownership. The model can infer that ownership changes can lead to rebranding or disassociation from a brand, as seen with the EOS DCH Owner LLC acquisition.\n\n4. **Complex Causal Chains**:\n   - The involvement of various stakeholders (e.g., investment funds, local companies) in the ownership of Crowne Plaza properties highlights the complexity of real estate transactions and the potential for multiple factors influencing a property's status.\n\n5. **Economic Implications**:\n   - The financial details surrounding these transactions (e.g., sale prices, renovation costs) provide insight into the economic motivations behind ownership changes, which can inform the model about the broader implications of such transactions in the hospitality industry.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe Crowne Plaza brand is owned by the InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG), but specific properties associated with the brand may have different owners due to various transactions. The model should understand that while IHG owns the brand, the operational status of individual hotels can change based on ownership dynamics, financial decisions, and market conditions.\n\n### Answer:\nThe owner of the Crowne Plaza brand is InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG), but specific properties under this brand may have different owners, such as EOS DCH Owner LLC and Hargate Properties, depending on recent transactions."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwho is the owner of the crowne plaza\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['In September 2017, Massachusetts Mutual Life sold the hotel building to a new owner, EOS DCH Owner LLC, for $106.5 million.
