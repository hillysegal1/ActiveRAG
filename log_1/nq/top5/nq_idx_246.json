The initial legislative independence in the 1780s, led by Henry Grattan, was short-lived due to the Act of Union in 1801, which merged the Irish and British parliaments. This act was influenced by the British government's fear of rebellion, particularly after the Irish Rebellion of 1798, which was partly motivated by the revolutionary fervor in France.\n\n2. **Catalysts for Change**:\n   - The Easter Rising of 1916 was a pivotal moment that galvanized public support for independence. The subsequent Irish War of Independence (1919-1921) saw the Irish Republican Army (IRA) engage in armed conflict against British forces, further intensifying the push for self-governance.\n\n3. **Key Agreements**:\n   - The Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921 was a critical turning point, establishing the Irish Free State as a self-governing dominion within the British Commonwealth. This treaty was a direct outcome of the Anglo-Irish War and was ratified by the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922, marking a formal recognition of Ireland's autonomy.\n\n4. **Evolution of Independence**:\n   - Although the Irish Free State was established on December 6, 1922, it did not achieve full sovereignty until later. The adoption of a new constitution in 1937 and the Statute of Westminster in 1931 allowed for greater legislative independence, culminating in Ireland declaring itself a republic in 1949, fully severing ties with the British Commonwealth.\n\n5. **Understanding Causation and Interconnectedness**:\n   - The reasoning process illustrates a clear causal chain: the fear of rebellion led to the Act of Union, which fostered a desire for independence that was realized through the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The model can recognize how political, social, and economic factors interact, shaping the course of history and influencing the independence movement.\n\n6. **Temporal Relationships**:\n   - The timeline from the 1780s to the 1940s provides a framework for understanding the gradual progression from limited autonomy to full independence. This temporal aspect is essential for logical inference, allowing the model to grasp the sequence of events and their implications.\n\nBy integrating these insights, the model can enhance its ability to reason causally about historical events, recognize patterns in political developments, and make logical inferences about the implications of those events.\n\n### Answer:\nIreland gained its independence from England on December 6, 1922, with the establishment of the Irish Free State, which was a significant step towards full autonomy.
