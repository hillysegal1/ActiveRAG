The division into East Sussex and West Sussex has roots that trace back to the late medieval period, where the county was informally divided for taxation purposes. This historical context is crucial as it shows that the division is not a recent phenomenon but rather a longstanding administrative practice.\n\n2. **Local Government Act 1972**: The formal split into East Sussex and West Sussex occurred in 1974, as a result of the Local Government Act 1972. This act was significant as it reorganized local government in England and Wales, creating new administrative counties and districts. The establishment of East Sussex and West Sussex as separate ceremonial counties was a key outcome of this legislative change.\n\n3. **Boundary Changes**: The 1974 reorganization involved not just a simple division but also significant boundary changes. For instance, parts of the historical administrative division known as the \"rape of Lewes\" were transferred from East Sussex to West Sussex. This illustrates the complexity of historical administrative boundaries and their relevance to modern governance.\n\n4. **Urban Development Influence**: The inclusion of areas like Crawley and Gatwick Airport, which were formerly part of Surrey, in the boundary changes highlights the impact of urban development and infrastructure on administrative divisions. This reflects how modern needs and urbanization can influence historical boundaries, making them dynamic rather than static.\n\n5. **Trends in Local Governance**: The amalgamation of Brighton and Hove into a unitary authority in 1997 indicates ongoing changes in local governance structures. This trend towards unitary authorities suggests a simplification of governance, which may continue to evolve the administrative landscape of Sussex.\n\n6. **Significance of the Division**: Understanding the reasons behind the division\u2014such as historical taxation needs, legal frameworks, and urban development\u2014provides a deeper insight into the significance of the split. It illustrates how administrative boundaries can reflect both historical legacies and contemporary societal needs.\n\n### Answer:\nSussex split into East Sussex and West Sussex in 1974, as part of the Local Government Act 1972, which reorganized local government in England and Wales.

This historical context is crucial for understanding the administrative evolution of the region.\n\n2. **Legislative Action**: The formal division of Sussex into East Sussex and West Sussex was enacted under the Local Government Act 1972, with the changes taking effect in 1974. This act was a significant legislative measure aimed at reorganizing local government structures in England and Wales.\n\n3. **Geographic and Administrative Changes**: The 1974 reorganization involved not just a nominal division but also actual geographic changes.
