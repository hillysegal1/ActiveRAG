This distinction is important as it reflects the evolution of scientific terminology and the transition towards a more standardized nomenclature in the scientific community. Understanding this shift helps contextualize the adoption of \"Celsius\" in modern usage.\n\n2. **Historical Figure - Anders Celsius**: \n   - Anders Celsius was born in 1701 and is best known for defining the temperature scale that bears his name. In 1742, he established the scale with 0 degrees Celsius as the freezing point of water and 100 degrees Celsius as the boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure. The adoption of his name for the temperature scale occurred posthumously, honoring his contributions to science.\n\n3. **Celsus**: \n   - The passages mention \"Celsus,\" a historical figure from around 45 AD, who is not directly related to the temperature scale but shares a similar name. This figure, coming from a family of Greek origin, provides an interesting historical context. However, it is essential to clarify that the temperature scale \"Celsius\" is named after Anders Celsius, not Celsus.\n\n4. **Cultural and Geographical Context**: \n   - The geographical references to Ephesus and Sardis in relation to Celsus provide insight into the cultural and historical backdrop of the name.

This evolution is crucial for understanding how scientific language develops over time.\n\n### Answer:\nThe word \"Celsius\" originates from the name of the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius, who was born in 1701 and is best known for developing the Celsius temperature scale in 1742. This scale defines 0 degrees Celsius as the freezing point of water and 100 degrees Celsius as the boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure. The term \"Celsius\" was adopted in honor of Anders Celsius after his death, reflecting his significant contributions to the field of science. While the name \"Celsus\" appears in historical contexts, it is important to note that the temperature scale is specifically named after Anders Celsius, not the earlier figure.

However, it is important to note that the term \"Celsius\" may also have connections to the Roman author Aulus Cornelius Celsus, whose name is phonetically similar. \n\n1. **Anders Celsius**: Anders Celsius was born in 1701 and died in 1744. He is best known for defining the Celsius temperature scale in 1742, where 0 degrees Celsius corresponds to the freezing point of water and 100 degrees Celsius corresponds to the boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure. The term \"Celsius\" was adopted in honor of him after his death.\n\n2. **Celsus Reference**: The passages retrieved mention \"Celsus,\" which refers to a historical figure, possibly Aulus Cornelius Celsus. This connection is crucial for understanding the etymology of the term \"Celsius.\" While the temperature scale is named after Anders Celsius, the similarity in names may lead to confusion regarding the origin of the term.\n\n3. **Historical Context**: Celsus was of Greek origin and had a notable family background in the Roman Empire. This historical context could be relevant for understanding the broader implications of the name \"Celsius\" and its usage in scientific terminology.\n\n4. **Terminology Usage**: The transition from \"centigrade\" to \"Celsius\" in scientific contexts reflects the evolution of terminology over time. This change highlights the standardization of the Celsius scale in scientific discourse, which is important for clarity in communication.\n\nIncorporating this information allows for a more nuanced understanding of the term \"Celsius,\" acknowledging both Anders Celsius's contributions and the historical figure of Celsus.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe word \"Celsius\" originates from the name of the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius, who developed the Celsius temperature scale in the 18th century. He defined the scale in 1742, where 0 degrees Celsius is the freezing point of water and 100 degrees Celsius is the boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure. The term \"Celsius\" was adopted in his honor after his death. Additionally, the name may also evoke the Roman author Aulus Cornelius Celsus, whose historical significance adds depth to the etymology of the term. The transition from \"centigrade\" to \"Celsius\" in scientific usage reflects the evolution of terminology in the field."}], "question_info": {"question": "what is the origin of the word celsius", "passages": ["For scientific use, \"Celsius\" is the term usually used, with \"centigrade\" remaining in common but decreasing use, especially in informal contexts in English-speaking countries.
