The film explores themes of identity, transformation, and personal relationships, particularly between Lili Elbe and her wife, Gerda Wegener.\n\n1. **Filming Locations**: The film was shot in various locations, primarily in Europe, including Copenhagen, Denmark, and several sites in the UK, particularly London. Given that the film is centered around Danish culture and Lili Elbe's life, it is logical to conclude that significant scenes, especially the last one, would be filmed in Denmark.\n\n2. **Emotional and Narrative Closure**: The last scene of a film often serves as a culmination of the character's journey and the themes presented throughout the narrative.

Therefore, the filming location for the last scene would likely reflect the film's themes of identity and belonging.\n\n3. **Cultural Significance**: Filming in Copenhagen not only aligns with the historical context of Lili Elbe's life but also enhances the film's authenticity. The city represents a significant part of Lili's identity and story, making it a fitting choice for the final scene.\n\n4. **Critical Reception and Contextual Understanding**: The film's reception, including its positive ratings and cultural discussions surrounding gender identity, further emphasizes the importance of the setting in conveying the film's message.
