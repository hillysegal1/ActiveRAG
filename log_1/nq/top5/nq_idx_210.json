This design choice is intentional, as it mimics the natural structure of an orange, making it visually appealing and relatable to consumers. The product contains **20 segments**, which allows for easy sharing and individual enjoyment, aligning with social eating practices.\n\n2. **Segmentation and Consumption**:\n   - The segments are firmly attached before unwrapping, which necessitates a specific action (tapping) to separate them. This method not only enhances the experience of consuming the chocolate but also creates a ritualistic aspect to the product, encouraging interaction and engagement among consumers. The act of \"tapping\" signifies a cause-and-effect relationship: the action leads to the desired outcome of separating the segments for consumption.\n\n3. **Cultural and Historical Context**:\n   - Understanding that Terry's Chocolate Orange has been around since 1932 and has undergone changes in production can provide insights into its enduring popularity. The historical context can help the model reason about how product longevity and brand evolution impact consumer perception and market strategies. The cultural practice of sharing chocolate during celebrations or gatherings can also be inferred from the product's design and segmentation.\n\n4. **Logical Inference**:\n   - Given that the product is explicitly designed to be divided into segments, it is logical to conclude that the number of pieces is fixed at 20. This understanding can be applied to other similar products, allowing the model to infer that segmented designs often indicate a specific number of consumable pieces.\n\n### Answer:\nA Terry's Chocolate Orange contains **20 pieces**.
