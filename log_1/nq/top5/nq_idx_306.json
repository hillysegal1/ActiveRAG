The current passages do not contradict this information but rather highlight the absence of specific references, which can be corrected by adding the accurate locations.\nPlease verify the above reasoning process for errors, \nthen enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to update the language model's knowledge, prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions.\nAfterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n\nGeneration Format:\nknowledge enhanced inference process:\nAnswer:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Knowledge Enhanced Inference Process:\nThe Lord's Prayer is a significant prayer in Christianity, attributed to Jesus Christ, and is often recited by believers. It is found in two distinct passages in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. \n\n1. **Matthew 6:9-13** - This passage is part of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus teaches His disciples how to pray. It is the more commonly referenced version of the Lord's Prayer.\n2. **Luke 11:2-4** - This version appears in response to a disciple's request for guidance on how to pray, and it contains slight variations in wording compared to the Matthew version.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided passages, it is clear that none of them offer specific references to the locations of the Lord's Prayer in the Bible. Instead, they either mention the prayer itself or suggest that the text follows without providing the necessary citations. \n\nThe passage labeled **'BULLET::::9. \"The Lord\\'s Prayer\" - 2:11\\n'** seems to incorrectly reference a chapter and verse that do not correspond to the known locations of the Lord's Prayer.
