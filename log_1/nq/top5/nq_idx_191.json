The corporate tax landscape can change due to government budgets, economic strategies, and legislative reforms, making it crucial to reference the most current information available.\n\n1. **Historical Context**:\n   - The UK has seen significant changes in its corporate tax rate over the past decade. Notably, reforms between 2009 and 2012 reduced the corporate tax rate from 28% to 20%, and eventually to 19%. This trend reflects a strategic effort to enhance the UK's attractiveness to businesses, especially in response to competition from countries with lower tax rates, such as Ireland.\n\n2. **Recent Developments**:\n   - As of my last knowledge update in October 2023, the UK government announced plans to increase the corporate tax rate to 25% for companies with profits exceeding \u00a3250,000. This change indicates a shift in policy aimed at addressing fiscal needs while still maintaining a lower rate for smaller businesses.\n\n3. **Current Tax Structure**:\n   - The corporate tax rate is now structured to differentiate between larger and smaller companies. Companies with profits below \u00a350,000 will continue to be taxed at the lower rate of 19%. This tiered approach allows for a more equitable tax burden, supporting smaller enterprises while generating additional revenue from larger corporations.\n\n4. **Implications of the Changes**:\n   - The shift from a flat rate to a tiered system reflects a nuanced understanding of the economic landscape, where smaller businesses are supported to foster growth, while larger entities contribute more significantly to the tax base. This approach is indicative of broader economic strategies that aim to balance competitiveness with fiscal responsibility.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe corporate tax rate in Great Britain is **25%** for companies with profits over **\u00a3250,000**, while smaller companies with profits below **\u00a350,000** are taxed at **19%**.

Smaller companies with profits below \u00a350,000 would continue to be taxed at the lower rate of 19%.
