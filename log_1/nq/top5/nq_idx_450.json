Other types of fuels, such as butane or gasoline, are not suitable for Zippo lighters because they can damage the lighter or do not ignite properly. Therefore, when refilling a Zippo lighter, it is essential to use the appropriate lighter fluid to ensure proper functioning and safety.\n\nAnswer: Lighter fluid (naphtha).\nTo update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions. \nI retrieved some knowledge that may update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions\nNote that these passages are retrieved from the most authoritative knowledge repositories, so they are assumed to be correct.\nknowledge:\nBased on the provided passages, the following information can be extracted that may update the model's knowledge regarding the type of fuel used in a Zippo lighter:\n\n1. **Fuel Content**: The first passage states that \"Zippo lighters purchased new do not contain fuel.\" This is important because it clarifies that when someone buys a new Zippo lighter, it will not come pre-filled with fuel, which may contradict any existing knowledge that suggests otherwise.\n\n2. **Type of Fuel**: The first passage also mentions that \"Zippo also offers for sale a name brand lighter fluid.\" This indicates that the specific type of fuel recommended for use in Zippo lighters is their branded lighter fluid, which could be an important detail to include in the model's knowledge base.\n\n3. **Refillable Nature**: The mention that Zippo lighters are \"refillable metal lighters\" emphasizes their design and functionality, which is a key characteristic that distinguishes them from disposable lighters. This could help clarify any misconceptions about the nature of Zippo lighters.\n\nBy incorporating this information, the model can better understand the specifics of Zippo lighters, including their lack of initial fuel, the recommended fuel type, and their refillable design. This would help alleviate potential model illusions and ensure that the information provided is accurate and reliable.\nPlease verify the above reasoning process for errors, \nthen enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to update the language model's knowledge, prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions.\nAfterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n\nGeneration Format:\nknowledge enhanced inference process:\nAnswer:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Knowledge Enhanced Inference Process:**\n\nA Zippo lighter is designed to use a specific type of fuel that is suitable for its operation. The most common fuel used in Zippo lighters is lighter fluid, which is typically a type of naphtha. This fuel is a liquid hydrocarbon that is highly flammable and is specifically formulated for use in refillable lighters. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that Zippo lighters purchased new do not contain fuel. This means that when someone buys a new Zippo lighter, they will need to purchase lighter fluid separately to fill it. Zippo also offers its own brand of lighter fluid, which is recommended for use in their lighters. \n\nAdditionally, it is crucial to understand that other types of fuels, such as butane or gasoline, are not suitable for Zippo lighters. Using these fuels can damage the lighter or result in improper ignition. Therefore, when refilling a Zippo lighter, it is essential to use the appropriate lighter fluid to ensure proper functioning and safety.\n\nIn summary, the key points to remember are:\n1. New Zippo lighters do not come pre-filled with fuel.\n2. The recommended fuel for Zippo lighters is their branded lighter fluid (naphtha).\n3. Zippo lighters are refillable, distinguishing them from disposable lighters.\n4. Other fuels, such as butane or gasoline, should not be used.\n\nBy incorporating this information, the model can provide a more accurate and comprehensive answer regarding the type of fuel used in Zippo lighters, thereby alleviating potential model illusions and ensuring the reliability of the information.\n\n**Answer:**\nLighter fluid (naphtha) is the recommended fuel for Zippo lighters. New Zippo lighters do not come pre-filled with fuel, so you will need to purchase lighter fluid separately. It is important to use the appropriate lighter fluid, as other fuels like butane or gasoline can damage the lighter or do not ignite properly."}], "question_info": {"question": "what type of fuel goes in a zippo", "passages": ["Unlike disposable lighters, Zippo lighters purchased new do not contain fuel.

However, if the flame is blown from the top down, it will be easily extinguished. The proper way to extinguish the lighter is to close the top half, which starves the flame of oxygen, but unlike other lighters, this does not cut off the fuel supply. One of the recognizable features of Zippo is the fact that it burns with a wick. Opening the top lid produces an easily recognizable \"clink\" sound for which Zippo lighters are known, and a different but similarly recognizable \"clunk\" when the lighter is closed. This noise is produced by the spring-loaded toggling cam, a little lever that keeps the lid closed or opened securely. \n"], "__answers__": ["butane", "lighter fluid"]}}
