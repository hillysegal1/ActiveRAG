The actor who played Mose Schrute is **Michael Schur**, who is also one of the creators of the show.\n\nIt's important to clarify that while Dwight makes a humorous claim about having \"resorbed\" a twin brother, this is a fictional element of his character's backstory and does not refer to an actual character portrayed by a different actor. The confusion may arise from the comedic nature of the show, where such statements are often exaggerated for humor.\n\nTo summarize, the model should be updated to reflect that Mose Schrute is Dwight's cousin, played by Michael Schur, and that the claim about a twin brother is a comedic narrative rather than a factual representation of a character played by another actor.\n\n**Answer:**\nMose Schrute, who is Dwight's cousin, was played by Michael Schur in \"The Office.\" Dwight also humorously claims to have a twin brother, but this is part of the character's fictional backstory and not represented by a separate actor."}], "question_info": {"question": "who played dwight's brother on the office", "passages": ["Rainn Dietrich Wilson (born January 20, 1966) is an American actor, comedian, writer, director, businessman, and producer.
