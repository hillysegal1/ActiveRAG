Mars has a thin atmosphere, primarily composed of carbon dioxide (about 95%), with traces of nitrogen, argon, and oxygen. The temperatures on Mars can drop significantly, especially at the poles, where snow is most likely to form.\n\nOn Earth, snow is predominantly made of frozen water (H2O). However, on Mars, the conditions differ markedly. While there is evidence of water ice on Mars, particularly in the polar regions, the snow that forms during the winter months is primarily composed of frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice, or solid CO2). This occurs when temperatures drop low enough for carbon dioxide to freeze, leading to the formation of snow-like deposits.\n\nRecent research has shown that Mars' polar caps are primarily composed of water ice, with dry ice forming only a thin seasonal layer. This indicates that while dry ice is a significant component of Martian snow during certain times of the year, water ice also plays a crucial role in the overall composition of the polar regions.\n\nAdditionally, the phenomenon of dry ice storms has been proposed, which are comparable to thunderstorms on Earth but involve crystalline CO2 instead of water. This suggests that the dynamics of weather on Mars can involve different materials than those found on Earth, further complicating our understanding of Martian snow.\n\nThe surface of Mars is also covered by a thick mantle that is a mixture of ice and dust. This ice-rich mantle can influence the surface's appearance and geological activity, such as the potential for ice to melt and create gullies. The presence of few craters on this mantle indicates that it is relatively young, suggesting ongoing geological processes that could affect the distribution and state of ice and dust on Mars.\n\nBy synthesizing this information, we can infer that the snow on Mars is primarily made of frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice), particularly during the winter months, but it is essential to recognize that water ice is also a significant component of the polar caps.\n\n### Answer:\nThe snow on Mars is primarily made of frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice), especially during the winter months.
