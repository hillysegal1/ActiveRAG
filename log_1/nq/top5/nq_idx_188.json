His innovation was crucial in making popcorn a viable snack option for theaters, as it enabled the efficient preparation of large quantities of popcorn.\n\n2. **Samuel M. Rubin**, known as \"Sam the Popcorn Man,\" is credited with the mass introduction of popcorn machines to cinemas in the 1930s. He was inspired to bring popcorn to theaters after observing it being made in Oklahoma City.

Its association with movie theaters began to solidify in the early 20th century, particularly during the 1930s. The Great Depression played a significant role in this transition, as popcorn was an inexpensive snack that theaters could sell for profit, making it appealing to audiences looking for affordable entertainment options.\n\nWhile it is commonly stated that no single person can be credited with the introduction of popcorn to theaters, the contributions of key figures are significant. Samuel M. Rubin, known as \"Sam the Popcorn Man,\" is credited with the mass introduction of popcorn machines to cinemas. However, there is some uncertainty regarding whether he was the first to sell popcorn in theaters, as his daughter and a former partner indicate that he may not have sold popcorn in quantity until the 1950s. This suggests that while Rubin played a crucial role in popularizing popcorn in cinemas, he may not have been the original seller.\n\nOn the other hand, Charles Cretors invented the first popcorn machine in 1885 and is noted for introducing popcorn to movie theaters in New York in the 1930s. His invention was foundational to the commercialization of popcorn in cinemas, indicating that he played a significant role in making popcorn a staple snack during film screenings.\n\nIn summary, the widespread adoption of popcorn in movie theaters was influenced by a combination of economic factors and the efforts of individuals like Rubin and Cretors. The timeline indicates that popcorn became popular in theaters in the 1930s, particularly in New York, which contrasts with narratives suggesting it was always a staple at the movies.\n\n**Answer:**\nPopcorn became popular at the movies in the 1930s, largely due to its affordability during the Great Depression. While no single person is credited with its introduction to theaters, Samuel M. Rubin is recognized for popularizing popcorn machines in cinemas, and Charles Cretors invented the first popcorn machine in 1885, which facilitated its commercialization in theaters."}], "question_info": {"question": "who came up with popcorn at the movies", "passages": ["BULLET::::- Samuel M.
