Understanding this context is crucial for grasping the significance of the bond between Eragon and Saphira.\n\n2. **Character Relationships**:\n   - Eragon's journey begins when he discovers a dragon egg, which hatches into Saphira. This event marks the start of his transformation into a Dragon Rider. The relationship between Eragon and Saphira is not just one of companionship; it is a deep bond that enhances their abilities and influences their decisions throughout the narrative.\n   - Brom's revelation that he was also a Dragon Rider and had a dragon named Saphira adds layers to the narrative, indicating a legacy of Dragon Riders and the responsibilities they carry.\n\n3. **Causal Events**:\n   - The discovery of the dragon egg leads to the hatching of Saphira, which in turn catalyzes Eragon's involvement in the larger conflict against King Galbatorix.
