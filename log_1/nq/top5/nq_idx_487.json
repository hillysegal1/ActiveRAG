This theme can be applied to Eric's experiences, indicating that social dynamics and rivalries may affect his romantic pursuits, even if they are not the central focus of the narrative.\n\n3. **Transformation and Change**:\n   - The transformation of characters, such as Alex, emphasizes the role of personal growth in shaping romantic opportunities.
