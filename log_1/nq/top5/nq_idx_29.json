This period saw a shift from copper to aluminum due to cost considerations and the availability of materials. However, aluminum wiring was later associated with safety issues, particularly concerning connections that could overheat and lead to electrical fires.\n\n2. **Safety Concerns**: The safety issues associated with aluminum wiring became apparent as it was implicated in numerous house fires. These incidents prompted increased scrutiny from both the public and regulatory bodies. The problems were primarily due to the tendency of aluminum to expand and contract with temperature changes, which could loosen connections and create arcing.\n\n3. **Regulatory Changes**: In response to these safety concerns, building codes and regulations were updated. The Canadian Electrical Code (CEC) and local building codes in Ontario began to reflect these concerns, leading to a gradual discouragement of aluminum wiring in new residential construction.\n\n4. **Timeline of Changes**: The significant decline in the use of aluminum wiring began in the late 1970s and continued into the early 1980s. By the early 1980s, many jurisdictions, including Ontario, had started to phase out aluminum wiring in favor of safer alternatives like copper.

However, it was later discovered that aluminum wiring posed significant safety risks, particularly related to connections that could overheat and lead to house fires.\n\n2. **Historical Context and Safety Issues**: The safety concerns surrounding aluminum wiring were not isolated incidents; they were part of a broader trend observed across North America. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and other safety organizations began to document the risks associated with aluminum wiring, which included increased incidents of electrical fires.\n\n3. **Regulatory Changes**: In response to these safety concerns, building codes and regulations were updated. The Canadian Electrical Code (CEC) and local building codes in Ontario were revised to discourage or ban the use of aluminum wiring in new residential construction.

Homeowners with aluminum wiring are often advised to have their systems inspected and potentially upgraded to ensure safety.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The significant decline in the use of aluminum wiring in Ontario occurred in the early 1980s, driven by safety concerns and subsequent changes in building codes and regulations. This historical context reinforces the understanding of how safety issues can lead to regulatory changes and shifts in industry practices.\n\n### Answer:\nAluminum wiring was largely phased out in Ontario in the early 1980s due to safety concerns related to overheating and house fires, which prompted changes in building codes and regulations to enhance electrical safety."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhen did they stop using aluminum wiring in ontario\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['Also in April 2007, Duncan announced that Ontario would ban the sale of inefficient incandescent light bulbs by 2012.
