The first step in this evolutionary journey is believed to be the formation of simple light-sensitive cells. These cells allowed organisms to detect light and dark, which provided a survival advantage by helping them navigate their environment, find food, and avoid predators.

The initial step in this evolutionary journey is often described as the formation of simple light-sensitive cells, which allowed early organisms to detect light and dark. This ability provided a significant survival advantage, enabling these organisms to navigate their environments, find food, and avoid predators.\n\nHowever, recent insights from the retrieved passages indicate that the evolution of the eye is also deeply rooted in genetic mechanisms, particularly the role of the Pax-6 gene. This master control gene is crucial for eye development and has homologues in various species, suggesting that genetic factors play a foundational role in the evolution of the eye. \n\nThe process of eye morphogenesis begins with the evagination of optic grooves, which develop into optic vesicles. This transformation is a critical early step in eye development, leading to the formation of the optic cup, retina, and other eye structures. Thus, while the formation of light-sensitive cells is an important early evolutionary step, the genetic and developmental processes that follow are equally significant in the overall evolution of the eye.\n\nIn summary, the first step in the evolution of the eye can be viewed through two lenses: the formation of simple light-sensitive cells and the genetic regulation initiated by the Pax-6 gene, which orchestrates subsequent developmental processes. This dual perspective provides a more comprehensive understanding of how eyes evolved over time.\n\n### Answer:\nThe first step in the evolution of the eye is the formation of simple light-sensitive cells, which allowed early organisms to detect light and dark. Additionally, the role of the Pax-6 gene is crucial in regulating the development of the eye, marking a significant genetic foundation for eye evolution.
