Sokolowski, a former political prisoner, was shot and killed by East German border troops while attempting to cross the Berlin Wall near to the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag building.\\n', 'Walter Ulbricht, the East German leader, invited Pervukhin to his summer house to discuss the East German immigration flow to West Germany. There Ulbricht told Pervukhin that if the Soviets did not react soon, East Germany would \"collapse\". Pervukhin discussed other problems as well, claiming that Ulbricht but also the East German leadership in general, were opposed to the Soviet Union\\'s plan to improve relations with West Germany. When Khrushchev gave his approval to construct what would become the Berlin Wall, Pervukhin was the first to know. Ulbricht told Pervukhin of the need to create the East\u2013West barrier at night, and he and Khrushchev would later agree to this.\\n', 'In 1975 he was sent back to Berlin where he served a second stint as Soviet ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, remaining in post this time till 1983. His years as ambassador were not without Soviet-East German tensions. During the early 1960s the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev was interested in exploring a less confrontational relationship with the west while the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht, remained uncompromisingly hard-line in his attitude to the west in general and in his country\\'s relationship with West Germany specifically. The decision suddenly to erect the Berlin Wall in August 1961 was naturally taken by the East Germans in full consultation with the Soviet ambassador. From the East German perspective The Wall represented a necessary desperate attempt to save the state which appeared to be in the process of losing its entire working age population. With Abrassimov as Soviet ambassador in Berlin, Walter Ulbricht, who had earlier enjoyed close relations with Soviet leader Josef Stalin, found he enjoyed far less direct contact with the Soviet leadership in Moscow. In 1963/64, when Ulbricht moved to control air traffic flying into West Berlin, it was Abrassimov who prevented the move. He actively opposed East German reluctance to conclude a belated post war peace treaty with West Germany, and in 1966 set up direct links with Willy Brandt, then the mayor of West Berlin, without telling the leadership of the East German ruling SED (party). Abrassimov also participated regularly in meetings of the East German cabinet, something which had never happened when Mikhail Pervukhin was the Soviet ambassador. The relationship between the Soviet ambassador and the East German leadership did not improve with the appointment of a new East German leader, Erich Honecker, in 1971. During the 1980s Abrassimov\\'s growing propensity to meet regularly with western ambassadors to Berlin without reference to his East German host government did not help matters. In 1983 he was seen to be becoming ever more paternalistic and autocratic in his ambassadorial office, and following the death of Leonid Brezhnev at the end of 1982, Honecker managed to persuade Moscow to replace Abrassimov because of the extent of his \"interference in East German domestic politics\".\\n', 'Walter Ulbricht (1893\u20131973) was the party boss from 1950 to 1971. In 1933, Ulbricht had fled to Moscow, where he served as a Comintern agent loyal to Stalin. As World War II was ending, Stalin assigned him the job of designing the postwar German system that would centralize all power in the Communist Party. Ulbricht became deputy prime minister in 1949 and secretary (chief executive) of the Socialist Unity (Communist) party in 1950. Some 2.6 million people had fled East Germany by 1961 when he built the Berlin Wall to stop them \u2014 shooting those who attempted it. What the GDR called the \"Anti-Fascist Protective Wall\" was a major embarrassment for the program during the Cold War, but it did stabilize East Germany and postpone its collapse. Ulbricht lost power in 1971, but was kept on as a nominal head of state. He was replaced because he failed to solve growing national crises, such as the worsening economy in 1969\u201370, the fear of another popular uprising as had occurred in 1953, and the disgruntlement between Moscow and Berlin caused by Ulbricht\\'s d\u00e9tente policies toward the West.\\n']\n\nTask Description:\nPlease extract content that may be unfamiliar to the model from these passages, \nwhich can provide the model with relevant background and unknown knowledge and concepts, \nhelping it better understand the question. and analyze the role of these contents.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To answer the question regarding the leader of the Soviet Union when the Berlin Wall was built, we can extract and analyze relevant content from the provided passages.

To determine the leader of the Soviet Union at that time, we must consider the historical context and key figures involved.\n\n1. **Nikita Khrushchev's Leadership**: Nikita Khrushchev was the leader of the Soviet Union from 1953 until 1964. His leadership coincided with the construction of the Berlin Wall, which was a direct response to the escalating tensions between East and West, particularly regarding the mass emigration of East Germans to West Germany. Khrushchev's agreement to allow East German leader Walter Ulbricht to construct the wall indicates his pivotal role in this decision.\n\n2. **Motivations Behind the Wall**: The construction of the Berlin Wall was primarily motivated by a significant emigration crisis, where approximately 2.6 million East Germans fled to the West by 1961. This mass exodus threatened the stability of the East German state, prompting Ulbricht to seek Soviet support for a drastic solution to stem the flow of emigrants.\n\n3. **Walter Ulbricht's Position**: Walter Ulbricht, as the leader of East Germany, was a staunch communist who sought to maintain control over East Germany amidst growing dissatisfaction and emigration. His hardline stance necessitated Soviet backing, which Khrushchev provided, demonstrating the interconnectedness of Soviet and East German policies during this period.\n\n4. **Soviet-East German Relations**: The relationship between Khrushchev and Ulbricht was complex, characterized by differing approaches to the West. While Khrushchev was exploring a less confrontational stance, Ulbricht remained committed to a hardline policy. This tension highlights the political dynamics within the Eastern Bloc and the influence of Soviet leadership on East German actions.\n\n5. **Historical Context of the Cold War**: The Berlin Wall became a powerful symbol of the ideological divide between communism and capitalism. Understanding this context is crucial for grasping the significance of the wall beyond its physical structure, as it represented the broader geopolitical struggle of the era.\n\nBy synthesizing this information, we can conclude that Nikita Khrushchev was the leader of the Soviet Union when the Berlin Wall was built, and his policies and decisions were instrumental in shaping the events surrounding its construction.\n\n### Answer:\nNikita Khrushchev was the leader of the Soviet Union when the Berlin Wall was built on August 13, 1961."}], "associate": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a cognitive scientist focused on understanding the contextual relationships between information.

Understanding the geopolitical landscape of this time is crucial for contextualizing the actions of the leaders involved.\n\n2. **Identification of Leaders**: Nikita Khrushchev was the leader of the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964. His leadership coincided with significant events in the Cold War, including the construction of the Berlin Wall. This timeline is essential for establishing his role in the event.\n\n3. **Decision-Making Dynamics**: The construction of the Berlin Wall was not an isolated decision; it was a collaborative effort between East German leader Walter Ulbricht and Khrushchev. Ulbricht sought Khrushchev's approval due to the crisis of emigration from East Germany to West Germany, which threatened the stability of the East German state.\n\n4. **Causal Relationships**: The emigration crisis, where approximately 2.6 million people fled East Germany by 1961, created a sense of urgency for East German leaders. This situation directly led to the decision to construct the Berlin Wall as a means to prevent further emigration and stabilize the regime.\n\n5. **Political Relationships**: The relationship between Khrushchev and Ulbricht was characterized by a mix of cooperation and tension. While Khrushchev's approval was necessary for the wall's construction, his broader policies aimed at d\u00e9tente with the West sometimes conflicted with Ulbricht's hardline stance.\n\n6. **Implications of the Wall**: The Berlin Wall represented not only a physical barrier but also a symbolic division between East and West, reflecting the ideological struggle of the Cold War.

Sokolowski, a former political prisoner, was shot and killed by East German border troops while attempting to cross the Berlin Wall near to the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag building.\\n', 'Walter Ulbricht, the East German leader, invited Pervukhin to his summer house to discuss the East German immigration flow to West Germany. There Ulbricht told Pervukhin that if the Soviets did not react soon, East Germany would \"collapse\". Pervukhin discussed other problems as well, claiming that Ulbricht but also the East German leadership in general, were opposed to the Soviet Union\\'s plan to improve relations with West Germany. When Khrushchev gave his approval to construct what would become the Berlin Wall, Pervukhin was the first to know. Ulbricht told Pervukhin of the need to create the East\u2013West barrier at night, and he and Khrushchev would later agree to this.\\n', 'In 1975 he was sent back to Berlin where he served a second stint as Soviet ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, remaining in post this time till 1983. His years as ambassador were not without Soviet-East German tensions. During the early 1960s the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev was interested in exploring a less confrontational relationship with the west while the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht, remained uncompromisingly hard-line in his attitude to the west in general and in his country\\'s relationship with West Germany specifically. The decision suddenly to erect the Berlin Wall in August 1961 was naturally taken by the East Germans in full consultation with the Soviet ambassador. From the East German perspective The Wall represented a necessary desperate attempt to save the state which appeared to be in the process of losing its entire working age population. With Abrassimov as Soviet ambassador in Berlin, Walter Ulbricht, who had earlier enjoyed close relations with Soviet leader Josef Stalin, found he enjoyed far less direct contact with the Soviet leadership in Moscow. In 1963/64, when Ulbricht moved to control air traffic flying into West Berlin, it was Abrassimov who prevented the move. He actively opposed East German reluctance to conclude a belated post war peace treaty with West Germany, and in 1966 set up direct links with Willy Brandt, then the mayor of West Berlin, without telling the leadership of the East German ruling SED (party). Abrassimov also participated regularly in meetings of the East German cabinet, something which had never happened when Mikhail Pervukhin was the Soviet ambassador. The relationship between the Soviet ambassador and the East German leadership did not improve with the appointment of a new East German leader, Erich Honecker, in 1971. During the 1980s Abrassimov\\'s growing propensity to meet regularly with western ambassadors to Berlin without reference to his East German host government did not help matters. In 1983 he was seen to be becoming ever more paternalistic and autocratic in his ambassadorial office, and following the death of Leonid Brezhnev at the end of 1982, Honecker managed to persuade Moscow to replace Abrassimov because of the extent of his \"interference in East German domestic politics\".\\n', 'Walter Ulbricht (1893\u20131973) was the party boss from 1950 to 1971.
