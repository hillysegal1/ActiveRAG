These cases arose from a state law that granted a monopoly to a specific slaughterhouse, which significantly impacted local butchers' rights and livelihoods. Therefore, it is essential to recognize that the butchers involved in these legal disputes were primarily located in New Orleans.\n\n2. **Living Conditions**: The passages indicate that many slaughterhouse workers, including butchers, were immigrants (Irish, German, and Scandinavian) and lived in slums adjacent to the slaughterhouses. This suggests that economic factors, such as low wages and the need for proximity to work, influenced their residential choices. The poor living conditions, characterized by overcrowding and environmental hazards, further highlight the challenges faced by these workers.\n\n3. **Specific Locations**: While the passages mention other locations (Greeley, Colorado, and St. Charles, Illinois), these references pertain to individual butchers rather than the broader context of the Slaughterhouse Cases.
