The war officially began on September 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. This invasion led Britain and France to declare war on Germany on September 3, 1939, marking the escalation of the conflict into a global war.\n\nThe war continued for several years, involving numerous nations and significant battles across various theaters. It officially ended on September 2, 1945, when Japan formally surrendered to the Allied forces, marking the conclusion of hostilities. This surrender followed the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, which played a crucial role in Japan's decision to capitulate.\n\nIn reviewing the retrieved knowledge, we confirm that:\n1. **End Dates**:\n   - The war officially ended on September 2, 1945, which aligns with the historical consensus.\n   - August 15, 1945, is noted as the date of Japan's announcement of surrender, but it is not the formal end date of the war.\n\n2. **Start Dates**:\n   - The war began on September 1, 1939, with the invasion of Poland, which is a critical detail that should be emphasized.\n\n3. **Contradictory Information**:\n   - The passage stating \"World War II (January 12, 1943 - November 27, 1945)\" is misleading and should be flagged as incorrect.
