A pivotal moment in this process was the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, where European powers convened to divide Africa among themselves. This conference is significant because it exemplifies how colonial powers disregarded existing ethnic, cultural, and political boundaries when drawing borders. The arbitrary nature of these borders often resulted in the grouping together or separation of various ethnic groups, leading to conflicts that persist to this day.\n\nThe colonial borders were not only a product of political negotiations but were also influenced by military commanders and colonial administrators who imposed their own interests without considering the local populations. For instance, the Niger-Chad border was created by French military leaders, highlighting the lack of local input in the border-drawing process.\n\nAfter World War II, many African nations gained independence; however, the borders established during the colonial period largely remained intact.

The Organization of African Unity, established in 1963, solidified this stance by proclaiming that any changes to colonial borders would be illegitimate, thereby avoiding the readdressing of the injustices of colonial partition.\n\nThe consequences of these arbitrary borders are profound. They have contributed to ongoing ethnic tensions, civil wars, and political instability across the continent. The borders often do not reflect the demographic realities of the region, leading to divisions within communities and families. Furthermore, the historical context of mapping in Africa, which was influenced by European perspectives, has shaped how these borders were conceptualized and imposed.\n\nIn summary, the creation of Africa's borders is a complex interplay of colonial ambition, military strategy, and political expediency, resulting in a legacy that continues to affect the continent today.\n\n### Answer:\nThe borders of Africa's countries were primarily created by European colonial powers during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, notably at the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, where they were drawn arbitrarily without regard for existing ethnic and cultural boundaries.

The establishment of these borders was largely a product of the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, where European powers convened to divide the African continent among themselves. This division was executed without consideration for the existing ethnic, cultural, or political landscapes, resulting in arbitrary boundaries that often grouped disparate ethnic groups together or separated those with shared identities.\n\n1. **Colonial Powers and the Berlin Conference**: The Berlin Conference is a pivotal moment in the history of Africa's borders. It marked the formalization of colonial claims and the drawing of lines on maps that would define nations, often disregarding the realities on the ground. The borders established during this conference have largely remained intact in the post-colonial era, despite the independence movements that swept across Africa after World War II.\n\n2. **Artificial Borders and Ethnic Divisions**: The borders created by colonial administrators were not based on demographic or cultural considerations. As noted by Jeffrey Herbst, these borders are \"artificially created\" and do not align with the continent's diverse ethnic and topographic realities. This has led to significant social issues, including ethnic tensions and conflicts, as communities were split or forced to coexist within the same political boundaries.\n\n3. **Impact of Colonialism**: The motivations behind the creation of these borders were primarily political and economic, aimed at facilitating colonial control rather than reflecting the needs of African societies. This has resulted in ongoing conflicts, as the arbitrary nature of the borders often ignores tribal affiliations and historical relationships, leading to instability and violence in various regions.\n\n4. **Post-Colonial Consensus**: In the contemporary context, there is a paradox where many African leaders have accepted the colonial borders as fixed, largely due to the Organization of African Unity's stance in 1963, which deemed any changes to these borders as illegitimate. This acceptance has stifled discussions about the injustices of colonial partition and has contributed to the persistence of these borders, despite their problematic nature.\n\n5. **Specific Examples**: The example of the Niger-Chad border illustrates how specific borders were drawn by colonial powers, such as French military commanders, often based on strategic interests rather than the realities of local populations. This localized approach to border creation reflects the broader trend of colonial governance that prioritized control over cultural coherence.\n\nIn summary, the borders of Africa's countries were primarily created by European colonial powers during the late 19th century, particularly at the Berlin Conference. These borders were drawn arbitrarily, disregarding the continent's complex ethnic and cultural landscapes, leading to significant social and political challenges that persist today.

He acknowledged this as unjust and unchristian, and as a solution offered total segregation, that is apartheid, between the blacks and the whites.\n", "The book argues that Africa will continue to suffer from wars due to the irrationality of its borders, which were drawn by colonial powers, which do not take into account tribal and ethnic loyalties. According to Friedman, Africa will gradually reshape itself into a continent of stable nations, including a few major powers, and that the best policy is to simply leave Africa alone and provide humanitarian assistance, and allow the continent's borders to be gradually rearranged through warfare.\n", "During the Berlin Conference in 1884-85 Africa was carved up between the European colonial powers, defining boundaries that are largely intact with today's post-colonial states. On 5 August 1890 the British and French concluded an agreement to clarify the boundary between French West Africa and what would become Nigeria. A boundary was agreed along a line from Say on the Niger to Barruwa on Lake Chad, but leaving the Sokoto Caliphate in the British sphere. Parfait-Louis Monteil was given charge of an expedition to discover where this line actually ran. On 9 April 1892 he reached Kukawa on the shore of the lake. Over the next twenty years a large part of the Chad Basin was incorporated by treaty or by force into French West Africa. On 2 June 1909 the Wadai capital of Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9 was occupied by the French. The remainder of the basin was divided by the British in Nigeria who took Kano in 1903, and the Germans in Kameroun. The countries of the basin regained their independence between 1956 and 1962, retaining the colonial administrative boundaries.\n", "In 1985, prompted by economic uncertainties and a rising crime rate, the government of Buhari opened the borders (closed since April 1984) with Benin, Niger, Chad and Cameroon to speed up the expulsion of 700,000 illegal foreigners and illegal migrant workers. Buhari is today known for this crisis; there even is a famine in the east of Niger that have been named \"El Buhari\".\n", "Before 1749, maps of the African continent had African kingdoms drawn with assumed or contrived boundaries, with unknown or unexplored areas having drawings of animals, imaginary physical geographic features, and descriptive texts. In 1748, Jean B. B. d'Anville created the first map of the African continent that had blank spaces to represent the unknown territory. This was revolutionary in cartography and the representation of power associated with map making.\n", "Herbst notes a modern paradox regarding the colonial borders in Africa: while they are arbitrary there is a consensus among African leaders that they must be maintained. Organization of African Unity in 1963 cemented colonial boundaries permanently by proclaiming that any changes made were illegitimate. This, in effect, avoided readdressing the basic injustice of colonial partition, while also reducing the likelihood of inter-state warfare as territorial boundaries were considered immutable by the international community.\n", "The White Fathers then left Ghadames. On 25 March 1890, while the Brussels conference against slavery was being held, Mgr Lavigerie explained in a letter to Keller that to eradicate in Africa the great Muslim corporation of the Senussi, which protected the slave-trade, the Sahara must be crossed, and he announced the opening at Biskra in Algeria, at the entrance to the Sahara, of a so-called House of God, intended for the formation of the \"Brothers of the Sahara\" or \"Pioneers of the Sahara\", who would engage in charitable works and in extending hospitality to travelers, the sick and fugitive slaves. The Pioneers of the Sahara had to live as religious, but without monastic vows. As early as February, 1891, the station at Ouargla, also in northern Algeria, suppressed in 1876, was re-established, and in October Father Harquard sent thither six armed \"pioneers\" who wrote to the cardinal: \"We shall endeavor to hold high the banner of the Sacred Heart and the flag of France.\" The White Sisters founded hospitals at Gharda\u00efa and El Tbiod Sidi Cheikh, thus gaining the confidence of populations which were hostile to France.\n"], "__answers__": ["European imperial powers"]}}
