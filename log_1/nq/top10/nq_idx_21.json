This did not prevent the Pope from having some influence on the decisions of Spanish monarchs, but it did force the influence to be through the kings making direct influence very difficult.\n", "Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella requested a papal bull establishing an inquisition in Spain in 1478. Pope Sixtus IV granted a bull permitting the monarchs to select and appoint two or three priests over forty years of age to act as inquisitors. In 1483, Ferdinand and Isabella established a state council to administer the inquisition with the Dominican Friar Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada acting as its president, even though Sixtus IV protested the activities of the inquisition in Aragon and its treatment of the \"conversos\". Torquemada eventually assumed the title of Inquisitor-General.\n", "The Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition (), commonly known as the Spanish Inquisition (\"Inquisici\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola\"), was established in 1478 by Catholic Monarchs Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. It was intended to maintain Catholic orthodoxy in their kingdoms and to replace the Medieval Inquisition, which was under Papal control. It became the most substantive of the three different manifestations of the wider Catholic Inquisition along with the Roman Inquisition and Portuguese Inquisition. The \"Spanish Inquisition\" may be defined broadly, operating in Spain and in all Spanish colonies and territories, which included the Canary Islands, the Spanish Netherlands, the Kingdom of Naples, and all Spanish possessions in North, Central, and South America. According to modern estimates, around 150,000 were prosecuted for various offenses during the three-century duration of the Spanish Inquisition, out of which between 3,000 and 5,000 were executed (3% of all cases).\n"], "__answers__": ["Dominican Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada", "Grand Inquisitor", "Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada", "the Spanish Dominican Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada"]}}
