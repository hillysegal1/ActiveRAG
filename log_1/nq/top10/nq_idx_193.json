This is a factual error, as the specific phrase does not appear in that song.\n\n1. **Correct Attribution**: The phrase \"you are a magnet and I am steel\" is from \"Magnet and Steel,\" which is a well-known song by Walter Egan released in 1978. This song is recognized for its catchy melody and romantic lyrics.\n\n2. **Clarification of Misattribution**: The previous reasoning mistakenly identified the song and artists, which could lead to confusion. It's important to clarify that while \"You're the One That I Want\" is a popular song, it does not contain the lyrics in question.\n\n3. **Absence of Relevant Information**: The retrieved passages do not provide any information about \"Magnet and Steel\" or Walter Egan, highlighting a gap in the model's knowledge. This reinforces the need for accurate updates to prevent misinformation.\n\n4. **Preventing Model Illusions**: By ensuring that the model recognizes Walter Egan as the correct artist for the lyrics \"you are a magnet and I am steel,\" we can prevent potential model illusions where the model might incorrectly associate these lyrics with other songs or artists.\n\nIn summary, the key update needed for the model is the identification of Walter Egan as the artist who sings \"Magnet and Steel.\" This addition will help prevent factual errors and alleviate any potential model illusions related to this specific query.\n\n**Answer:** Walter Egan."}], "question_info": {"question": "who sings you are a magnet and i am steel", "passages": ["Steel Magnolia \u2014 EP is a 5-song extended play released on February 23, 2010, by country music duo Steel Magnolia.
