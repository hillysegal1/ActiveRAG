This practice is widely adopted across the United States, but not universally.\n\n2. **States Opting Out of DST**: Some states have chosen not to observe DST due to various factors, including geographical considerations, public preference, and historical context. This decision often reflects local attitudes toward time changes and the impact on daily life.\n\n3. **Identifying Non-DST States**: The two states that do not observe DST are:\n   - **Arizona**: Arizona does not observe DST, with the notable exception of the Navajo Nation, which does observe DST in its northeastern region. This reflects a unique situation where a tribal jurisdiction within the state follows different timekeeping rules.\n   - **Hawaii**: Hawaii is the other state that does not observe DST. Its geographical location and climate contribute to the decision to maintain standard time year-round.\n\n4. **Legislative Context and Proposals**: The passages indicate that while most states participate in DST, there are ongoing discussions and proposals in various states to either adopt year-round standard time or to opt out of DST altogether. For instance, several states in New England have considered legislation for year-round Atlantic Standard Time, and Washington state has proposed year-round DST pending congressional approval.\n\n5. **Historical Evolution of DST Policies**: The historical context provided in the passages, such as Indiana's transition to statewide DST in 2006, illustrates that state policies regarding DST can change over time based on legislative action and public opinion. This highlights the dynamic nature of timekeeping practices in the U.S.\n\n6. **Federal Legislation**: The Uniform Time Act of 1966 established a framework for DST across the U.S. but allows states the autonomy to opt out. This legal provision is crucial for understanding why Arizona and Hawaii do not observe DST, as it grants them the authority to remain on standard time year-round.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe contextual relationships reveal that while the majority of U.S. states observe DST, Arizona and Hawaii have opted out of this practice for various reasons, including geographical and cultural factors.

This practice is not universally adopted across all states in the U.S.\n\n2. **States Opting Out of DST**: Some states have chosen not to observe DST due to various factors, including geographical location, public preference, and historical context. The states that do not observe DST are:\n   - **Arizona**: Most of Arizona does not observe DST, with the exception of the Navajo Nation, which does observe DST.\n   - **Hawaii**: Hawaii has opted out of DST entirely.\n\n3. **U.S. Territories**: In addition to the states, several U.S. territories also do not observe DST, including American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands.\n\n4. **Historical Context**: The practice of DST has evolved over time. For example, before 2006, most of Indiana did not observe DST, but it now does. Additionally, from 1945 to 1966, there was no federal law mandating DST, allowing localities to decide their observance.\n\n5. **Legislative Proposals**: Some states, particularly in New England and Washington state, have proposed legislation to adopt year-round standard time (Atlantic Standard Time or Mountain Standard Time) to avoid the biannual clock changes associated with DST. This reflects ongoing discussions about the relevance and effectiveness of DST.\n\n6. **Causal Relationships**: The decision to observe or not observe DST can be influenced by various factors, including energy savings, public opinion, and regional customs. Understanding these factors helps clarify why certain states or territories choose to opt out of DST.\n\n7. **Understanding Exceptions**: The distinction between states that do not observe DST and those that do (like the Navajo Nation within Arizona) illustrates the concept of exceptions and conditional reasoning, which is crucial for understanding how rules can vary based on specific contexts.\n\n### Answer:\nThe states that do not observe Daylight Saving Time are Arizona (except for the Navajo Nation) and Hawaii.
