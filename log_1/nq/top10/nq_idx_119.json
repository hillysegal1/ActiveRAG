The division of Sussex into East and West Sussex has roots in both taxation and ecclesiastical governance, specifically the division at the River Adur into the archdeaconries of Chichester (West) and Lewes (East). This historical context is crucial for understanding the reasons behind the division.\n\n2. **Administrative Divisions**:\n   - The formal administrative split of Sussex into East Sussex and West Sussex occurred in 1889 with the enactment of the Local Government Act 1888. This act established the two as separate administrative counties, each with its own county council. Prior to this, the division had been recognized informally for taxation and ecclesiastical purposes since at least the late medieval period.\n\n3. **Legislative Changes**:\n   - The Reform Act of 1832 marked an important step in the administrative division of Sussex, as it recognized the eastern and western divisions that corresponded to the archdeaconries. The Local Government Act 1972 further revised county boundaries, establishing East Sussex and West Sussex as ceremonial counties and transferring certain areas between them.\n\n4. **Modern Developments**:\n   - The administrative structure of Sussex has continued to evolve, with significant changes occurring in 1974 and later in 1997 when Brighton and Hove became a unitary authority. This ongoing evolution reflects the changing needs of local governance and population dynamics.\n\n5. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - Understanding the historical context and legislative changes allows the model to infer causal relationships between governance structures and regional development. For example, the establishment of separate administrative counties was a response to the growing need for localized governance, which can be linked to population growth and urbanization.\n\n6. **Temporal Dynamics**:\n   - The timeline of changes from medieval taxation divisions to modern ceremonial counties provides insight into how historical decisions influence present governance structures. This understanding can enhance the model's ability to reason about future administrative changes based on past patterns.\n\nBy integrating these insights, the model can develop a nuanced understanding of the historical, political, and social factors that shape administrative boundaries and governance, thereby enhancing its causal reasoning and logical inference capabilities.\n\n### Answer:\nSussex split into East Sussex and West Sussex in 1889, following the enactment of the Local Government Act 1888, which established them as separate administrative counties.
