Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup. Real Madrid\u2019s title was its 12th, extending its record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as \"La Duod\u00e9cima\". Real Madrid won their third title in a row in 2018 against Liverpool in Kiev, beating them 3-1. It was a match to forget for Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius who made two errors during the match: he performed a wayward throw which rebounded off Karim Benzema for Real Madrid\u2019s first goal. Then, following a great overhead bicycle kick by Gareth Bale for the Spaniards\u2019 second, he mishandled a long-range shot by Bale for Real Madrid\u2019s third.\n", "Real Madrid became the first team since Bayern Munich in 1974\u201376 to win three consecutive UEFA Champions Leagues or European Cups. The title was Madrid's 13th, another Champions League record, and their fourth in five years. Real Madrid's victory was the fifth consecutive title for a Spanish side in the Champions League, becoming the longest run for the trophy to be held by teams from the same country since English sides won six consecutive titles between 1977 and 1982.\n", "As of 26 May 2018, Real Madrid have won a record 33 La Liga and a record 13 European Cup / UEFA Champions League trophies. They are also the first club to win three consecutive Champions League trophies since its 1992 inception, by winning the 2016, 2017 and 2018 editions. The club was awarded with the recognition of FIFA Club of the 20th Century on 23 December 2000. It also received the FIFA Order of Merit in 2004. Added to this, Real is allowed to wear a multiple-winner badge on their shirt during UEFA Champions League matches as they have won more than five European Cups.\n", "On 7 December 2011, Real Madrid defeated Ajax with a 3\u20130 scoreline and concluded the Champions League group stage with six victories, becoming the fifth team in Champions League history to accomplish the feat. The victory was the team's 15th consecutive win to equal a club record set 50 years earlier, in 1961.\n", "Monaco holds the record of 14 consecutive wins in the Champions League.

They have scored at least one goal in 34 consecutive games. The run started with a 1\u20131 draw against Barcelona in the second leg of the semi-final of the 2010\u201311 season. This continued with all 12 matches of both the 2011\u201312 season and 2012\u201313 season, and continued into the 2013\u201314 season for nine games (six group stage games, both legs of the round of 16 and the first leg of the quarter-finals), with the run finally coming to an end in a 2\u20130 away loss in the quarter-finals second leg against Borussia Dortmund on 8 April 2014.\n", "In the modern era, the Madrid derby is the second biggest derby in Spanish football, behind El Cl\u00e1sico, and although Real Madrid have the larger worldwide fanbase, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid have also amassed a significant worldwide support, due to their level of success in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League in the early 21st century. Real Madrid is the most successful club in the Champions League, having won it thirteen times. Atl\u00e9tico have never won the Champions League, though they have reached the final on three occasions (losing narrowly to Real Madrid in two of those), and they have also won the Europa League three times since 2010 (compared to two UEFA Cups for Real Madrid in the 1980s) and the UEFA Super Cup three times (one of them against Real Madrid).\n", "The European Cup was inaugurated in 1955, with Real Madrid winning the first five editions. However, after winning the trophy five times in a row in the 1950s, and again in 1966, the club had little success until the end of the 1990s, apart from their runner-up place in 1981. Since then, Real Madrid has won the competition seven times, in 1998, 2000, 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and established itself as one of the strongest sides in European competitions, when measured in UEFA coefficients.

They have also won the competition the most times in a row, winning it five times from 1956 to 1960. Juventus have been runners-up the most times, losing seven finals. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid is the only team to reach three finals without having won the trophy while Reims and Valencia have finished as runners-up twice without winning. Spain has provided the most champions, with 18 wins from two clubs. Italy have produced 12 winners from three clubs and England have produced 13 winners from five clubs.

The streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins.
