He is often credited with modernizing the country and establishing a strong central government. His rise to power is crucial for understanding the political landscape of Egypt during this transitional period.\n\n2. **Appointment as Governor**: \n   - Muhammad Ali was appointed as the Ottoman governor (Wali) of Egypt in 1805. This appointment followed the earlier context where Ali Pasha had sought the governorship after the overthrow of Koca H\u00fcsrev Mehmed Pasha in 1803. His effective rule lasted until his death in 1849, marking a significant era in Egyptian history.\n\n3. **Causal Relationships**: \n   - The overthrow of Koca H\u00fcsrev Mehmed Pasha created a power vacuum that allowed Muhammad Ali Pasha to rise to prominence.
