It then travels north through several states along the East Coast, passing through major cities and scenic areas. \n\nThe northern terminus of US Highway 1 is at Fort Kent, Maine, at the Canada\u2013United States border, not Houlton, Maine as previously stated. This highway serves as a vital route connecting various regions along the eastern seaboard.\n\nAdditionally, US 1 closely parallels Interstate 95 (I-95) for much of its course, particularly between Jacksonville, Florida, and Petersburg, Virginia. It connects major cities including Miami, Jacksonville, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, Boston, and Portland, emphasizing its significance as a major transportation route.\n\nThe historical context of US 1's establishment in 1926 and its evolution, particularly in New York where its designation was complicated due to the lack of posted route numbers, provides further insight into its development and usage over time. In Virginia, US 1 serves mainly local traffic and is paralleled by Interstate Highways, indicating a shift in its role as a transportation route.\n\nBy incorporating these details, the model can better understand the full scope of US 1's route, its significance, and its historical context, thereby reducing the likelihood of factual errors and alleviating model illusions related to this highway.\n\n**Answer:**\nUS Highway 1 starts in Key West, Florida, and ends in Fort Kent, Maine, at the Canada\u2013United States border."}], "question_info": {"question": "where does us highway 1 start and end", "passages": ["U.S. Route\u00a01 (US\u00a01) is a part of the U.S. Highway System that extends from Key West, Florida, to the Canada\u2013United States border at Fort Kent, Maine.

However, because New York city did not post route numbers, US\u00a01 ended at the 42nd Street Ferry landing in Weehawken (where the old Lincoln Highway crossed into the city) and resumed again at the Bronx\u2013Westchester boundary.

After leaving the freeway, Highway 1 courses through the town centre of Hope for 2\u00a0km (1\u00bc\u00a0mi) before heading north across the Fraser River. At this point, Highway 1 becomes two lanes. 1\u00a0km (about \u00bd mi) north of the Fraser crossing, Highway 1 reaches its east junction with Highway 7.
