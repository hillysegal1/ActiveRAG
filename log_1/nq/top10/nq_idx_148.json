Therefore, the interpretation of \"CFC\" should depend on the specific context in which it is used."}], "question_info": {"question": "what is the full form of cfc's", "passages": ["Form Completion (FC)\n", "Face-centered cubic (FCC) \n", "FCCF\n", "FF.C\n", "Chfc\n", "A Certificate of Formula Compliance (often abbreviated to COFC) is a document used primarily for Health and Beauty Products in international trade. \n", "CFC, cfc, or Cfc may stand for:\n", "BULLET::::- CFC (Continuous Function Chart) is a sort of freehand FBD editor.
