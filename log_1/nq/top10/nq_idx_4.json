This early migration significantly influenced the cultural and social development of Hawaii.\n\n3. **Subsequent Waves of Immigration**:\n   - Following the Polynesians, various groups immigrated to Hawaii, including Chinese sailors who first arrived in **1778** and began settling in **1789**. This highlights a shift in immigration patterns influenced by trade and labor demands.\n\n4. **Economic Factors and Labor Needs**:\n   - The mid-to-late **19th century** saw a significant influx of Asian immigrants, particularly Chinese and Japanese, driven by the labor needs of the sugarcane plantations. This economic context is crucial for understanding the motivations behind immigration during this period.\n\n5. **Cultural and Social Dynamics**:\n   - The arrival of different immigrant groups, including American missionaries in **1820**, Japanese immigrants in **1868**, and Portuguese in **1878**, illustrates the evolving cultural landscape of Hawaii. These groups contributed to the social fabric of Hawaiian society, leading to intermarriage and cultural exchanges.\n\n6. **Policy Implications**:\n   - The distinction between government-sanctioned and non-sanctioned immigration, particularly regarding Japanese immigrants, reflects the role of governance in shaping immigration patterns. This aspect can inform our understanding of how policies impact demographic changes.\n\n7. **Long-term Consequences**:\n   - The lasting impact of these immigrant groups on Hawaii's population composition and cultural identity underscores the importance of immigration in shaping societal dynamics over time.\n\n### Answer:\nThe first immigrants to Hawaii were Polynesians, who arrived between **300 AD and 800 AD**, with most estimates placing their arrival around **500 AD**.
