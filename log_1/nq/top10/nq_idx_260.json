The contextual nuances of these requirements reflect the seriousness of the offense and the standards of care expected in various situations.\n\n1. **Existence of a Duty of Care**: The foundation of gross negligence manslaughter lies in the existence of a duty of care owed by the defendant to the victim. This duty can arise from various relationships, such as those between professionals (e.g., doctors and patients) or general societal obligations.

Thus, they argue that the section signifies more than gross negligence in the objective sense, and actually requires some degree of awareness of advertence. They go on to say that conduct which shows a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives and safety of others will by its nature constitute prima facie evidence of the mental element, and in the absence of evidence that casts doubt on the degree of mental awareness, proof of the act and reference to what a reasonable person in the circumstances must have realized will lead to a conclusion that the accused was aware of or willfully blind to the risk. In cases where the risk to the lives and safety of others present themselves in an obvious fashion, the accused\u2019s claim that he or she gave no thought to the risk or had simply a negative state of mind would in most cases amount to the culpable positive mental state of willful blindness to the prohibited risk. In the justice\u2019s perceived recognition of the harshness of a uniform application of an objective standard of criminal liability, they advocate a subjective dimension into the objective standard in order to relieve the harshness of imposing an objective standard on those who, because of their peculiar characteristics, could not fairly be expected to live up the standard set by the reasonable person. They advocate the use of a two-pronged test. They cite three formulations of the test, written by different authors, which are substantially the same:\n"], "__answers__": ["the defendant breached this duty", "the defendant owed a duty to the deceased to take care", "the breach caused the death of the deceased", "the defendant 's negligence was gross , that is , it showed such a disregard for the life and safety of others as to amount to a crime and deserve punishment"]}}
