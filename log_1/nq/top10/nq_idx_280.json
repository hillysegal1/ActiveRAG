Initially, after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, many states established a minimum legal drinking age of 21, which was consistent with the voting age at that time. However, this changed in the late 1960s and early 1970s when numerous states lowered their drinking ages to 18, largely in response to the 26th Amendment, which granted 18-year-olds the right to vote.\n\nThe pivotal moment came with the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984, which mandated that all states raise their minimum legal drinking age to 21 by October 1986. This legislation was driven by growing concerns about drunk driving incidents and the health risks associated with alcohol consumption among younger individuals. The act included a significant incentive: states that did not comply would face a reduction in federal highway funds, which pressured many states to conform to the new standard.\n\nFollowing the enactment of this law, states began to adjust their laws accordingly.

This act was a response to increasing concerns about drunk driving incidents and health issues associated with alcohol consumption among younger individuals. Prior to this act, the legal drinking age varied significantly across states, with many allowing individuals as young as 18 to purchase and consume alcohol.\n\n1. **Historical Context**: \n   - The legal drinking age was originally set at 21 after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, which coincided with the voting age at that time. However, in the early 1970s, many states lowered their drinking ages to 18 following the 26th Amendment, which lowered the voting age to 18. This shift reflected a broader societal trend of granting more rights to younger individuals.\n\n2. **Legislative Action**: \n   - The National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 mandated that all states raise their minimum legal drinking age to 21 by October 1986. States that did not comply risked losing up to 10% of their federal highway funds. This federal mandate was a significant factor in ensuring compliance across the nation.\n\n3. **State Compliance and Implementation**: \n   - By mid-1988, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had complied with the federal mandate, although some territories like Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands did not follow suit. For example, Wisconsin raised its drinking age to 21 effective September 1, 1986, in response to the act.\n\n4. **Contemporary Issues and Ongoing Debate**: \n   - The drinking age of 21 remains a contentious issue in American society. Critics argue that it is inconsistent with the age of majority (18) and point to drinking ages in other countries as being lower. Some states have proposed legislation to lower the drinking age, indicating ongoing public discourse and differing opinions on the matter.\n\n5. **Causal Relationships and Consequences**: \n   - The model can learn to identify the causal relationships between legislative actions and their societal impacts, such as the reduction in drunk driving fatalities attributed to the higher drinking age. Additionally, it can explore the implications of federal mandates on state laws and public behavior.\n\n6. **Temporal Reasoning**: \n   - Understanding the timeline of changes in the drinking age helps the model practice temporal reasoning, illustrating how historical events shape current laws and societal norms.\n\nBy integrating this knowledge, the model can enhance its ability to reason about the complexities of legislative processes, societal impacts, and the interplay between public opinion and policy decisions.\n\n### Answer:\nThe legal drinking age in the United States was changed to 21 with the passage of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984, which mandated that all states raise their minimum legal drinking age to 21 by October 1986. This change was implemented in response to concerns about drunk driving and health issues among younger individuals, and by mid-1988, all 50 states had complied with this federal mandate."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhen did the legal drinking age changed to 21\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['In response to the National Minimum Drinking Age Act in 1984, which reduced by up to 10% the federal highway funding of any state which did not have a minimum purchasing age of 21, the New York Legislature raised the drinking age from 19 to 21, effective December 1, 1985.
