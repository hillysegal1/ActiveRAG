This was followed by the Irish War of Independence (1919-1921), where armed conflict between Irish republicans and British forces intensified the push for self-governance.\n\n3. **Anglo-Irish Treaty**: The signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty on 6 December 1921 was a crucial moment in this struggle. The Treaty established the Irish Free State as a self-governing dominion within the British Commonwealth, marking a significant step towards independence. However, it also resulted in the partition of Ireland, creating Northern Ireland, which remained part of the UK.\n\n4. **Official Independence**: The Irish Free State officially came into existence on 6 December 1922, which is the date most commonly cited as the moment Ireland gained independence from England. This transition represented a shift from being a part of the British Empire to having its own government, albeit still under the Commonwealth.\n\n5. **Further Developments**: While the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922 was a major milestone, full sovereignty was not achieved until 1949, when the Republic of Ireland Act declared Ireland a republic, severing all remaining ties with the British monarchy and the Commonwealth. This highlights the gradual nature of Ireland's journey to complete independence.\n\n6. **Key Dates Summary**:\n   - **6 December 1921**: Signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty.\n   - **6 December 1922**: Official establishment of the Irish Free State.\n   - **1937**: Adoption of a new constitution, asserting further independence.\n   - **1949**: Declaration of the Republic of Ireland, fully independent from the UK.\n\n**Conclusion**: The answer to the question of when Ireland gained its independence from England is that it officially occurred on 6 December 1922 with the establishment of the Irish Free State. However, understanding the broader historical context, including the events leading up to this date and the subsequent developments, is essential for a comprehensive grasp of Ireland's path to independence.\n\n**Answer**: Ireland gained its independence from England on December 6, 1922, with the establishment of the Irish Free State, although full sovereignty was achieved in 1949 when it became a republic."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nwhen did ireland gain its independence from england\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n[\"A brief period of limited independence for Ireland came to an end following the Irish Rebellion of 1798, which occurred during the British war with revolutionary France.

This act merged Ireland with Great Britain into the United Kingdom, effectively removing Ireland's legislative autonomy.\n   - The Irish Rebellion of 1798 was a significant event that highlighted the tensions between Irish aspirations for independence and British control, leading to fears that an independent Ireland might ally with France during the Revolutionary Wars.\n\n2. **Catalysts for Independence**:\n   - The 1916 Easter Rising marked a pivotal moment in the struggle for independence, galvanizing public support for the republican cause. This event was crucial in shifting public sentiment towards the need for a more assertive push for independence.\n   - The subsequent Irish War of Independence (1919-1921) was a direct response to the rising support for independence, characterized by armed conflict between Irish republicans and British forces.\n\n3. **Key Agreements and Events**:\n   - The Anglo-Irish Treaty, signed on December 6, 1921, was a landmark agreement that established the Irish Free State as a self-governing dominion within the British Commonwealth.

This transition reflects the evolving nature of Ireland's independence and the gradual shift from dominion status to complete autonomy.\n\n5. **Partition of Ireland**:\n   - The Anglo-Irish Treaty led to the partition of Ireland, creating Northern Ireland, which remained part of the United Kingdom. This division has had lasting implications for Irish politics and identity, complicating the narrative of independence.\n\n6. **Complexity of Independence**:\n   - The model should recognize that the path to independence was not linear and involved various political, social, and military factors.

The Irish had been led to believe by the British that their loss of legislative independence would be compensated with Catholic emancipation, that is, by the removal of civil disabilities placed upon Roman Catholics in both Great Britain and Ireland.

The nation had gained \"de facto\" independence from Britain after the Anglo-Irish War, and the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 declared Ireland to be a 'sovereign, independent, democratic state'. A new constitution was adopted by a plebiscite in 1937. The Statute of Westminster meant that unlike in World War I, Britain's entry into the war no longer automatically included its dominions.

A war of independence followed that ended with the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1922, which partitioned Ireland between the Irish Free State, which gained dominion status within the British Empire, and a devolved administration in Northern Ireland, which remained part of the UK.

A Provisional Government was set up under the terms of the treaty, but the Irish Republic nominally remained in existence until 6 December 1922, when 26 of the island's 32 counties became a self-governing British Dominion called the Irish Free State. The island had been partitioned by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, and the six counties of Northern Ireland, which had been partitioned artificially so as to create and ensure a unionist majority, exercised their right under the Treaty to opt out of the Free State, and remain in the United Kingdom.\n"], "__answers__": ["In 1922", "1922"]}}
