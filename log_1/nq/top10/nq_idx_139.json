It is structured in the traditional four-movement format typical of classical symphonies, which allows for a variety of emotional expressions and thematic developments. The movements are as follows:\n\n1. **First Movement (Allegro)**: This movement is in sonata form, which typically consists of an exposition, development, and recapitulation. The dramatic and intense character of this movement is characteristic of the G minor key, which often conveys a sense of urgency and emotional depth. This contrasts with the more serene qualities of major keys, illustrating how the choice of tonality can influence the emotional landscape of a piece.\n\n2. **Second Movement (Andante)**: The second movement is more lyrical and contrasts with the first. It is structured in a theme and variations format, where a theme is presented and then altered in subsequent sections. This movement showcases Mozart's ability to develop a simple idea into a complex emotional narrative, highlighting the importance of thematic development in classical music.\n\n3. **Third Movement (Menuetto and Trio)**: This movement follows the traditional minuet and trio form. The minuet is stately and elegant, while the trio section provides a contrasting theme before returning to the minuet. This structure not only provides variety but also reflects the social dance forms of the time, illustrating how music can be influenced by cultural practices.\n\n4. **Fourth Movement (Allegro assai)**: The final movement is also in sonata form and is energetic and vigorous, bringing the symphony to a dynamic conclusion.
