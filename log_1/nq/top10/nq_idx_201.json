The growing military and industrial power of Germany prompted Britain, France, and Russia to strengthen their ties to counterbalance this threat.\n   - The **Franco-Russian Alliance** of 1894 laid the groundwork for the Triple Entente, as it established a military partnership between France and Russia, aimed at deterring German aggression.\n\n2. **Nature of the Alliance**:\n   - Unlike the formal military commitments of the Triple Alliance, the Triple Entente consisted of a series of agreements and understandings. It included the **Anglo-Russian Entente** (1907) and the **Entente Cordiale** between Britain and France (1904), which resolved colonial disputes and established a cooperative framework.\n   - This alliance was significant in shaping the alliances and hostilities that characterized World War I, as it created a clear division in Europe between the Entente Powers and the Central Powers.\n\n3. **Geopolitical Implications**:\n   - The formation of the Triple Entente was not merely a reaction to German expansionism; it also reflected broader geopolitical shifts, including colonial rivalries and the desire for collective security among the major powers.\n   - The **Fashoda Incident** (1898) and other conflicts highlighted the tensions between Britain and France, which were alleviated through the Entente, allowing them to focus on the common threat posed by Germany.\n\n4. **Historical Significance**:\n   - The Triple Entente played a crucial role in the dynamics of World War I, as it united three major powers against the Central Powers.

This alliance was primarily a response to the perceived threat posed by the growing power of Germany and its allies, particularly the Central Powers, which included Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy.\n\n1. **Historical Context**: The Triple Entente was not a formal military alliance but rather a series of agreements and understandings that aimed to create a counterbalance to the military might of Germany. This context is crucial for understanding the motivations behind the alliance.\n\n2. **Preceding Alliances**: Prior to the formation of the Triple Entente, there were significant alliances such as the **Franco-Russian Alliance** (1894), which was a military pledge between France and Russia to deter German aggression by threatening a two-front war. This earlier alliance laid the groundwork for the later cooperation among the three powers.\n\n3. **Strategic Calculations**: The formation of the Triple Entente was influenced by strategic calculations regarding military threats. The rise of Germany and its alliances prompted Great Britain, Russia, and France to seek closer ties to ensure mutual defense and deter aggression.\n\n4. **Interconnectedness of Alliances**: The alliances formed during this period were interconnected. The failure or success of one alliance often influenced the dynamics of others. For instance, the Franco-Russian Alliance's existence made it more appealing for Great Britain to align with France and Russia, thereby forming the Triple Entente.\n\n5. **Impact of Secrecy and Public Perception**: The effectiveness of the Triple Entente was also shaped by public perception and the need for transparency in diplomatic relations. The earlier Franco-Russian Alliance had been secretive, but as tensions escalated, the need for a more open alliance became apparent.\n\n6. **Ideological Underpinnings**: The ideological motivations behind alliances, such as the desire to counterbalance not just military threats but also ideological ones (e.g., liberalism vs. conservatism), played a role in shaping the relationships among these powers.\n\nBy synthesizing this information, we can see that the Triple Entente was a strategic response to a complex web of geopolitical threats and historical alliances. Understanding these dynamics enhances the model's ability to reason about the causes and implications of international alliances.\n\n### Answer:\nThe alliance between Great Britain, Russia, and France was known as the **Triple Entente**.
