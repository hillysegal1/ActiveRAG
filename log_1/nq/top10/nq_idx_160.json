Historical records indicate that the epidemic began in 1665 and continued until 1666. The outbreak was particularly severe during the summer of 1665, with a notable peak in fatalities occurring in August of that year. The epidemic is often associated with the Great Fire of London in September 1666, which some believe contributed to the end of the plague by destroying many of the unsanitary living conditions that facilitated its spread.\n\nTo deepen the understanding of this event, it is essential to consider several contextual factors:\n\n1. **Timeline of the Epidemic**:\n   - The Great Plague first appeared in early 1665, with a sharp increase in cases and deaths by June. The peak of the epidemic occurred in August, with over 31,000 deaths reported that month. The mortality rates remained high into September, indicating a prolonged period of suffering before the situation began to improve.\n\n2. **Impact on Society**:\n   - The plague had a catastrophic impact on London, resulting in approximately 60,000 deaths, which was about one-fifth of the city's population at the time. The unsanitary conditions of London, exacerbated by overcrowding, played a significant role in the rapid spread of the disease. The societal response included mass evacuations, with many fleeing to the countryside, including King Charles II and his court.\n\n3. **Culmination and Aftermath**:\n   - The Great Fire of London, which began on September 2, 1666, is often thought to have helped end the plague by destroying the urban environment that allowed it to thrive. However, it is now understood that the plague was already subsiding before the fire, suggesting that the fire's role in eradicating the disease was more of a coincidental consequence rather than a direct cause.\n\n4. **Historical Significance**:\n   - The Great Plague of London is a critical part of the historical narrative surrounding plague epidemics in Europe. It represents the culmination of centuries of plague outbreaks and is studied for its social, economic, and health-related implications. Understanding this context helps to frame the Great Plague not just as a local event but as part of a larger pattern of public health crises in history.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe Great Plague of London started in 1665 and ended in 1666, marking the last major outbreak of bubonic plague in England. The epidemic was characterized by high mortality rates and significant societal disruption, culminating in a peak of fatalities in August 1665. While the Great Fire of London in September 1666 is often associated with the end of the plague, it is important to note that the epidemic was already declining before the fire occurred.

It spread to other towns in East Anglia and the southeast of England but fewer than ten percent of parishes outside London had a higher than average death rate during those years.

Fatalities peaked in August with an estimated 31,159 deaths from plague, but continued to rage through September (6,978 died from plague in just the first week of September). Those with the means to do so fled London for the safety of the countryside, including Charles II and his court, which decamped to Salisbury in July and then to Oxford, where the King would remain until February 1666.\n", "The unsanitary and overcrowded City of London has suffered from the numerous outbreaks of the plague many times over the centuries, but in Britain it is the last major outbreak which is remembered as the \"Great Plague\" It occurred in 1665 and 1666 and killed around 60,000 people, which was one fifth of the population. Samuel Pepys chronicled the epidemic in his diary. On 4 September 1665 he wrote \"I have stayed in the city till above 7400 died in one week, and of them about 6000 of the plague, and little noise heard day or night but tolling of bells.\"\n", "From 1592-1593, London experienced its last major plague outbreak of the 16th Century. During this period, at least 15,000 people died of plague within the City of London and another 4,900 died of plague in the surrounding parishes.\n", "BULLET::::- 12 April: The first recorded victim of the Great Plague of London dies. On 7 July the King and court leave London to avoid the plague, moving first to Salisbury, then (from 25 September to 1 February 1666) Oxford (where in October Parliament convenes). The City begins use of Bunhill Fields as a burial ground for the victims.\n", "The Great Plague of 1665/1666 was the last major outbreak of bubonic plague in Great Britain. The last recorded death from plague came in 1679, and it was removed as a specific category in the Bills of Mortality after 1703. It spread to other towns in East Anglia and the southeast of England but fewer than ten percent of parishes outside London had a higher than average death rate during those years. Urban areas were more affected than rural ones; Norwich, Ipswich, Colchester, Southampton and Winchester were badly affected, while the West of England and areas of the Midlands escaped altogether.\n", "The plague returned at intervals with varying virulence and mortality until the early 19th century. In England, for example, the plague returned in 1360\u201363 killing 20% of Londoners and in 1369 killing 10\u201315%. In the 17th-century outbreaks were a series of \"great plagues\": the Great Plague of Seville (1647\u201352); the Great Plague of London (1665\u201366); and the Great Plague of Vienna (1679). In its virulent form, after the Great Plague of Marseille in 1720\u201322, the Great Plague of 1738 (which hit Eastern Europe), and the Russian plague of 1770\u20131772, it seems to have gradually disappeared from Europe though lingering in Egypt and the Middle East. By the early 19th\u00a0century, the threat of plague had diminished, but it was quickly replaced by a new disease. The Asiatic cholera was the first of several cholera pandemics to sweep through Asia and Europe during the 19th and 20th centuries.\n", "Plague cases continued to occur sporadically at a modest rate until the summer of 1666. On the second and third of September that year, the Great Fire of London destroyed much of the City of London, and some people believed that the fire put an end to the epidemic. However, it is now thought that the plague had largely subsided before the fire took place. In fact, most of the later cases of plague were found in the suburbs, and it was the City of London itself that was destroyed by the Fire.\n", "During the Great Plague of London in 1665, people boarded coaches at Whitehall, then at the edge of urban London, in an attempt to escape. The King and court temporarily moved to Oxford to avoid the plague, while Samuel Pepys remarked in his diary on 29 June, \"By water to Whitehall, where the Court is full of waggons and people ready to go out of town. This end of town every day grows very bad with plague\".\n", "The Great Plague was immediately followed by another catastrophe, albeit one which helped to put an end to the plague. On the Sunday, 2 September 1666 the Great Fire of London broke out at one o'clock in the morning at a bakery in Pudding Lane in the southern part of the City. Fanned by an eastern wind the fire spread, and efforts to arrest it by pulling down houses to make firebreaks were disorganised to begin with. On Tuesday night the wind fell somewhat, and on Wednesday the fire slackened. On Thursday it was extinguished, but on the evening of that day the flames again burst forth at the Temple. Some houses were at once blown up by gunpowder, and thus the fire was finally mastered. The Monument was built to commemorate the fire: for over a century and a half it bore an inscription attributing the conflagration to a \"\"popish frenzy\"\".\n"], "__answers__": ["1665 to 1666", "1665", "1666", "from 1665 to 1666"]}}
