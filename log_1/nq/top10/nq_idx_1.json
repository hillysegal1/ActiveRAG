It can be used for electricity generation and direct heating applications.\n\n2. **Identifying Key Regions**: In the United States, geothermal energy is most commonly harnessed in areas with significant volcanic activity or tectonic plate boundaries. This is because these regions have higher geothermal gradients, making it easier to access the heat.\n\n3. **Geothermal Energy Production**: The U.S. has several states that are known for their geothermal energy production. The most notable among these are California, Nevada, and Oregon.

California is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, with the conjunctions of tectonic plates providing California the largest potential for producing geothermal energy generation in the country. Most of California's geothermal plants are located slightly north of San Francisco in Lake Folsom and Sonoma Counties.
