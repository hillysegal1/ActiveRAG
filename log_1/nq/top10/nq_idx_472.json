Key areas involved in colonization include:\n   - **North Africa**: Countries such as Egypt, Libya, Algeria, and Tunisia were colonized primarily by European powers like France, Italy, and Britain. The strategic importance of these regions, especially the Suez Canal, made them focal points for colonial interests.\n   - **West Africa**: Nations including Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Mali were colonized mainly by Britain and France. The region was significant for its agricultural resources, including the Rice Coast, which was crucial for rice cultivation.\n   - **East Africa**: Countries like Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania were colonized by Britain, while Ethiopia remained largely independent, except for a brief Italian occupation. The region's resources and strategic location made it a target for colonial expansion.\n   - **Central Africa**: The Congo region, particularly the Congo Basin, was heavily exploited by Belgium under King Leopold II, leading to severe demographic and social impacts. Other areas were colonized by France and Germany.\n   - **Southern Africa**: Countries such as South Africa, Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia), and Namibia were colonized by the British and Dutch (Afrikaners).

By the end of the 19th century, the Congo Basin had been carved up by European colonial powers, into the Congo free state, the French Congo and the Portuguese Congo.\n", "During the 1961\u20131974 Portuguese Colonial War (a counterinsurgency against guerrillas), Portuguese Congo, Portuguese Angola and Portuguese Mozambique (colonies at the time) experienced economic growth in the production of oil, coffee, cotton, cashews, coconuts, timber, minerals (including diamonds), metals (such as iron and aluminium), bananas, citrus, tea, sisal, beer, cement, fish and other seafood, beef and textiles. Labour unions were prohibited, and minimum wage laws were not enforced. The outbreak of colonial wars in Africa set off significant social changes, among them the rapid incorporation of women into the labour market. Marcelo Caetano fostered economic growth and social improvement, such as a monthly pension to rural workers who had never contributed to Portugal's social security. The objectives of Caetano's pension reform were to increase equity and economic efficiency and reduce fiscal imbalance.\n", "BULLET::::- Landers, Jane. 1990. \"African Presence in Early Spanish Colonization.\" In \"Columbian Consequence.
