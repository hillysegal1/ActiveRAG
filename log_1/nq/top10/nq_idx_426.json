In humans, it is particularly noted when there is an open space between the upper incisors. This definition is crucial as it directly addresses the question.\n\n2. **Causes of Diastema**: Diastemas can arise due to various factors:\n   - An imbalance between the size of the teeth and the jaw, which can lead to spacing issues.\n   - The presence of a large labial frenum, which is the tissue that connects the upper lip to the gums, potentially pulling the teeth apart.\n   - Genetic factors and habits such as thumb sucking can also contribute to the development of a diastema.\n\n3. **Treatment Options**: Understanding the potential treatments for a diastema is important for those who may be concerned about its aesthetic or functional implications. Treatment can vary based on the cause and extent of the gap:\n   - Small gaps may be corrected with cosmetic procedures like fillings, veneers, or crowns.\n   - Larger gaps may require orthodontic intervention, such as braces, to realign the teeth.\n   - In some cases, periodontal surgery may be necessary to address issues related to the frenum.\n\n4. **Variability and Context**: Diastemas are not uncommon in children, as they often occur during the transition from primary to permanent teeth.
