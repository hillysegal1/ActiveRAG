The fuel must be a liquid that can easily evaporate and ignite when exposed to a spark. Zippo lighters are typically filled with a lighter fluid that is specifically formulated for use in these types of lighters. The most common type of fuel used in Zippo lighters is naphtha, which is a petroleum distillate. This fuel is ideal because it burns cleanly and produces a consistent flame. Other types of lighter fluids may also be used, but they should be compatible with the Zippo design to ensure proper functioning.\n\nAnswer: Zippo lighters use lighter fluid, typically naphtha.\nTo update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions. \nI retrieved some knowledge that may update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions\nNote that these passages are retrieved from the most authoritative knowledge repositories, so they are assumed to be correct.\nknowledge:\nBased on the retrieved passages, the following information can be extracted that may update the model's knowledge regarding the type of fuel used in Zippo lighters:\n\n1. **Fuel Type**: The passages indicate that most early Zippo lighters used naphtha as a fuel source.
