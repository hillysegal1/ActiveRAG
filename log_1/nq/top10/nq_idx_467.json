Sasaki thus played a key role in the creation of the first microprocessor.\n", "Curry and Hauser had become increasingly interested in the idea of selling their own computers and so, on 5 December 1978, they set up Cambridge Processor Unit Ltd (CPU). Their first customer was Ace Coin Equipment Ltd, who needed controllers for their fruit machines.\n", "Curry and Hauser decided to pursue their joint interest in microcomputers and, on 5 December 1978, they set up Cambridge Processor Unit Ltd. (CPU) as the vehicle with which to do this. CPU soon obtained a consultancy contract to develop a microprocessor-based controller for a fruit machine for Ace Coin Equipment (ACE) of Wales. The ACE project was started at office space obtained at 4a Market Hill in Cambridge. Initially, the ACE controller was based on a National Semiconductor SC/MP microprocessor, but soon the switch to a MOS Technology 6502 was made.\n", "Soon designs integrated the control unit and ALU into what became known as the central processing unit (CPU).\n", "A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor or main processor, is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term \"central processing unit\" at least since the early 1960s. Traditionally, the term \"CPU\" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.\n", "BULLET::::- Central processing unit \u2013 (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.

Traditionally, the term \"CPU\" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.\n", "By the late 1960s, designers were striving to integrate the central processing unit (CPU) functions of a computer onto a handful of very-large-scale integration metal-oxide semiconductor chips, called microprocessor unit (MPU) chipsets. Building on an earlier Busicom design from 1969, Intel introduced the first commercial microprocessor, the 4-bit Intel 4004, in 1971, followed by its 8-bit microprocessor 8008 in 1972. In 1969, Lee Boysel, based on the 8-bit arithmetic logic units (3800/3804) he designed earlier at Fairchild, created the Four-Phase Systems Inc. AL-1, an 8-bit CPU slice that was expandable to 32-bits. In 1970, Steve Geller and Ray Holt of Garrett AiResearch designed the MP944 chipset to implement the F-14A Central Air Data Computer on six metal-gate chips fabricated by AMI.\n", "The Intel 4004 is a 4-bit central processing unit (CPU) released by Intel Corporation in 1971. It was the first commercially available microprocessor, and the first in a long line of Intel CPUs. The silicon design only started in April 1970, when Federico Faggin joined Intel. Until then, the architectural proposal by Marcian Hoff had been idling without further development. Faggin took over the project and led it to its successful completion in January 1971. Masatoshi Shima participated in the architectural phase with Hoff and, later, in the logic design, helping Faggin to speed up the development.\n", "In the 1980s, Moore turned his attention and Forth development techniques to CPU design, developing several stack machine microprocessors and gaining several microprocessor-related patents along the way. His designs have all emphasized high performance at low power usage. He also explored alternate Forth architectures such as cmForth and machine Forth, which more closely matched his chips' machine languages.\n", "In his early career days, he worked at Pye, Royal Radar Establishment and W.R Grace Laboratories. Then, in April 1966 he joined Sinclair Radionics where he worked for 13 years. He was involved with their hifi products and their electric vehicle. In 1972, he helped Sinclair Radionics to launch its first electronic calculator, the Executive. He set up Cambridge Processor Unit Ltd. (CPU) in December 1978. Their first product was the Acorn Microcomputer (later called the System 1).\n"], "__answers__": ["John von Neumann"]}}
