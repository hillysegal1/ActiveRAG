This lifespan allows us to understand the historical and cultural influences that may have shaped his writing.\n\n4. **Understanding Historical Context**: Knowing the time period in which Sophocles lived helps to connect the themes of \"Antigone\" with the socio-political environment of ancient Greece, particularly the tensions between individual morality and state law, which are central to the play.\n\n5. **Authorial Intent and Influence**: Recognizing Sophocles as the author allows for an exploration of his thematic focus on moral dilemmas, the conflict between individual and state, and the exploration of fate versus free will. This understanding can enhance the model's ability to analyze character motivations and plot developments in similar literary contexts.\n\n6. **Intertextual Connections**: The existence of various adaptations and interpretations of \"Antigone\" by other authors (e.g., Jean Anouilh, Carl Orff) provides a rich ground for comparative analysis. Understanding these connections can help the model draw parallels and contrasts between different interpretations of the same source material.\n\n7. **Temporal Reasoning**: The model can learn to reason about the chronological order of events and the evolution of themes across different adaptations of \"Antigone,\" which can improve its temporal reasoning capabilities.\n\n8. **Cultural Significance**: Recognizing the enduring relevance of \"Antigone\" across different time periods and cultures enhances the model's understanding of how literature reflects and shapes societal values and conflicts, thereby improving its inferential reasoning about cultural narratives.\n\n### Answer:\nSophocles wrote \"Antigone.\" He was born around **497/6 BC** and died around **406/5 BC**. The play was written in or before **441 BC**, reflecting the socio-political dynamics of ancient Greece, particularly the tension between individual morality and state law.
