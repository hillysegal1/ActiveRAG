Hollywood made so much use of Technicolor in 1929 and 1930 that many believed the feature film industry would soon be turning out color films exclusively. By 1931, however, the Great Depression took its toll on the movie industry, which began to cut back on expenses. The production of color films had decreased dramatically by 1932, when Burton Wescott and Joseph A. Ball completed work on a new three-color movie camera. Technicolor could now promise studios a full range of colors, as opposed to the limited red-green spectrum of previous films. The new camera simultaneously exposed three strips of black-and-white film, each of which recorded a different color of the spectrum. The new process would last until the last Technicolor feature film was produced in 1955.\\n', 'Early movies were not actually color movies since they were shot monochrome and hand-colored or machine-colored afterwards. (Such movies are referred to as \"colored\" and not \"color\".) The earliest such example is the hand-tinted Annabelle Serpentine Dance in 1895 by Edison Manufacturing Company. Machine-based tinting later became popular. Tinting continued until the advent of natural color cinematography in the 1910s. Many black and white movies have been colorized recently using digital tinting. This includes footage shot from both world wars, sporting events and political propaganda.\\n', \"The real push for color films and the nearly immediate changeover from black-and-white production to nearly all color film were pushed forward by the prevalence of television in the early 1950s. In 1947, only 12 percent of American films were made in color. By 1954, that number rose to over 50 percent. The rise in color films was also aided by the breakup of Technicolor's near monopoly on the medium.\\n\", 'Cinecolor was also prominently employed in processing Paramount\\'s \"Popular Science\" series of short films \u2013 although later prints were made by Consolidated Film Industries under their Magnacolor process. Hal Roach Studios made all four of its features in Cinecolor in 1947\u20131948, becoming the first Hollywood studio to do an all-color schedule. The last American feature released in Cinecolor was Allied Artists\\' \"Pride of the Blue Grass\" (1954). \\n', 'In late 1934, Pioneer contracted with Technicolor to make nine features in the full color process, and hired RKO\\'s Merian C. Cooper to be its vice-president in charge of production. \"Becky Sharp\" (1935), an adaptation of Thackeray\\'s novel \"Vanity Fair\", became the first feature-length motion picture in full color, followed by \"Dancing Pirate\" (1936).\\n', 'By 1932, musicals were declining in popularity, and the studio was forced to cut musical numbers from many productions and advertise them as straight comedies. The public had begun to associate musicals with color, and thus studios began to abandon its use. Warner Bros. had a contract with Technicolor to produce two more pictures in that process. As a result, the first horror films in color were produced and released by the studio: \"Doctor X\" (1932) and \"Mystery of the Wax Museum\" (1933). In the latter part of 1931, Harry Warner rented the Teddington Studios in London, England. The studio focused on making \"quota quickies\" for the domestic British market and Irving Asher was appointed as the studio\\'s head producer. In 1934, Harry officially purchased the Teddington Studios.\\n', \"The proliferation of television in the early 1950s contributed to a heavy mid-century push for color within the film industry. In 1947, only 12 percent of American films were made in color. By 1954, that number had risen to over 50 percent. The color boom was aided by the breakup of Technicolor's near-monopoly on the medium. The last stand of black-and-white films made by or released through the major Hollywood studios came in the mid-1960s, after which the use of color film for all productions was effectively mandatory and exceptions were only rarely and grudgingly made.\\n\", \"From its birth in the 1880s, movies were predominantly monochrome. Contrary to popular belief, monochrome doesn't always mean black and white; it means a movie shot in a single tone or color. Since the cost of tinted film bases was substantially higher, most movies were produced in black and white monochrome. Even with the advent of early color experiments, the greater expense of color meant films were mostly made in black and white until the 1950s, when cheaper color processes were introduced, and in some years the percentage of films shot on color film surpassed 51%. By the 1960s, color became by far the dominant film stock. In the coming decades, the usage of color film greatly increased while monochrome films became scarce.\\n\", 'One of the first movies to use subtractive color was a silent film titled \"Cupid Angling\" (1918). In 1932, Walt Disney made the first film to use a red, green and blue color process (Technicolor), \"Flowers and Trees\". Three years later, the first feature length movie to be filmed entirely in 3-color Technicolor was \"Becky Sharp\".\\n', 'In the early 1950s, the proliferation of black-and-white television started seriously depressing North American theater attendance. In an attempt to lure audiences back into theaters, bigger screens were installed, widescreen processes, polarized 3D projection, and stereophonic sound were introduced, and more films were made in color, which soon became the rule rather than the exception. Some important mainstream Hollywood films were still being made in black-and-white as late as the mid-1960s, but they marked the end of an era. Color television receivers had been available in the US since the mid-1950s, but at first, they were very expensive and few broadcasts were in color. During the 1960s, prices gradually came down, color broadcasts became common, and sales boomed. The overwhelming public verdict in favor of color was clear. After the final flurry of black-and-white films had been released in mid-decade, all Hollywood studio productions were filmed in color, with the usual exceptions made only at the insistence of \"star\" filmmakers such as Peter Bogdanovich and Martin Scorsese.\\n']\n\nTask Description:\nPlease extract content that may be unfamiliar to the model from these passages, \nwhich can provide the model with relevant background and unknown knowledge and concepts, \nhelping it better understand the question. and analyze the role of these contents.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To answer the question of when movies started coming out in color, several key points and concepts can be extracted from the provided passages.

This indicates that color film technology was being explored as early as the late 1910s.\n\n### Technicolor Development\n- **Technicolor Innovations**: Technicolor began developing a full-color process in the 1920s, with significant advancements by 1929. By 1932, Technicolor had introduced a new three-color camera that allowed for a full spectrum of colors, moving beyond the limited color palettes of earlier films.\n- **First Feature-Length Color Film**: The first feature-length motion picture in full color was \"Becky Sharp\" (1935), which marked a significant milestone in the transition from black-and-white to color films.\n\n### Industry Trends and Adoption\n- **Color Film Popularity**: Despite early innovations, the adoption of color films was slow. By 1947, only 12% of American films were made in color. However, this number increased dramatically to over 50% by 1954, largely driven by the rise of television and the need for theaters to attract audiences back with more visually appealing content.\n- **Technicolor's Monopoly and Breakup**: The rise in color films was also facilitated by the breakup of Technicolor's near-monopoly on color film production, allowing for more studios to produce color films.\n\n### Mid-Century Shift\n- **Dominance of Color Films**: By the mid-1960s, color films became the standard in Hollywood, with black-and-white films becoming rare exceptions. This shift was influenced by the proliferation of color television and the public's preference for color content.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the transition to color films began with early experiments in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but significant advancements occurred with Technicolor in the 1920s and 1930s. The first feature-length color film was released in 1935, but it wasn't until the 1950s that color films became predominant in the industry, driven by technological advancements, the rise of television, and changing audience preferences. By the mid-1960s, color films were effectively the norm in Hollywood, marking the end of the black-and-white era in mainstream cinema. \n\nThus, while color films began to emerge in the early 20th century, their widespread adoption and dominance occurred primarily in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nTask Description:\n\nReview the reasoning process by evaluating how well the contextual relationships have been identified and utilized.

Notably, \"Annabelle Serpentine Dance\" (1895) is recognized as one of the first films to incorporate color, albeit not in a true sense.\n\n2. **Technological Innovations**: The development of color film technology saw significant advancements in the 1920s, particularly with Technicolor. By 1929, Technicolor was actively promoting its full-color process, which culminated in the introduction of a three-color camera by 1932. This innovation allowed for a broader spectrum of colors, moving beyond the limited palettes of earlier color processes.\n\n3. **First Feature-Length Color Film**: The landmark film \"Becky Sharp\" (1935) is credited as the first feature-length motion picture to utilize the three-color Technicolor process. This marked a pivotal moment in the transition from black-and-white to color films, setting a precedent for future productions.\n\n4. **Adoption Trends**: Despite early innovations, the adoption of color films was gradual. By 1947, only 12% of American films were in color, but this figure surged to over 50% by 1954. This shift was largely influenced by the rise of television, which prompted theaters to enhance their offerings with color films to attract audiences.\n\n5. **Mid-Century Dominance**: By the mid-1960s, color films became the standard in Hollywood, with black-and-white films becoming increasingly rare. This transition was further accelerated by the proliferation of color television, which solidified public preference for color content.\n\n6. **Cultural Impact**: The transition to color films not only transformed the aesthetic of cinema but also reflected broader cultural shifts in audience preferences and technological advancements in the film industry.\n\n### Final Answer:\nMovies began to incorporate color in the late 19th century with early experiments, but the first significant use of color in feature films occurred with the introduction of Technicolor in the 1930s.

The history of color in film dates back to the early 20th century. The first experiments with color film began in the late 1800s, but these were not widely adopted for commercial use.\n2. The first successful color process was Kinemacolor, introduced in 1908, which was used in a few films during the 1910s.\n3. However, the most significant advancement came with the introduction of Technicolor in the 1920s. The first feature-length film to use the three-color Technicolor process was \"Becky Sharp,\" released in 1935.\n4. The use of color in films became more common in the late 1930s and 1940s, with notable films like \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938) and \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939) showcasing the technology.\n5. By the 1950s, color films became the standard, and black-and-white films were increasingly rare.\n\nAnswer:\nMovies started coming out in color with the introduction of Kinemacolor in 1908, but the first significant use of color in feature films occurred with Technicolor in 1935, notably with \"Becky Sharp.\" Color films became more common in the late 1930s and 1940s.\nTo update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions. \nI retrieved some knowledge that may update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions\nNote that these passages are retrieved from the most authoritative knowledge repositories, so they are assumed to be correct.\nknowledge:\nBased on the retrieved passages, here are some key points that could update the model's knowledge regarding the history of color films and address potential inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Early Color Experiments**:\n   - The earliest examples of color in films were not true color films but rather monochrome films that were hand-tinted or machine-colored afterward. The first hand-tinted film was \"Annabelle Serpentine Dance\" (1895). This indicates that the concept of color in films predates the development of true color cinematography.\n\n2. **Technicolor Development**:\n   - Technicolor began developing a full-color process as early as 1924, with significant advancements by 1929. However, the production of color films decreased dramatically by 1932 due to the Great Depression, which could correct any misconceptions about the continuous production of color films during this period.\n\n3. **First Feature-Length Color Film**:\n   - \"Becky Sharp\" (1935) is noted as the first feature-length motion picture in full color, which is a specific detail that could be added to clarify the timeline of color films.\n\n4. **Rise of Color Films in the 1950s**:\n   - The proliferation of television in the early 1950s significantly contributed to the increase in color films.

By the mid-1960s, color films were effectively mandatory for all productions."}], "question_info": {"question": "when did movies start coming out in color", "passages": ["Technicolor envisioned a full-color process as early as 1924 and was actively developing such a process by 1929. Hollywood made so much use of Technicolor in 1929 and 1930 that many believed the feature film industry would soon be turning out color films exclusively. By 1931, however, the Great Depression took its toll on the movie industry, which began to cut back on expenses. The production of color films had decreased dramatically by 1932, when Burton Wescott and Joseph A. Ball completed work on a new three-color movie camera. Technicolor could now promise studios a full range of colors, as opposed to the limited red-green spectrum of previous films. The new camera simultaneously exposed three strips of black-and-white film, each of which recorded a different color of the spectrum. The new process would last until the last Technicolor feature film was produced in 1955.\n", "Early movies were not actually color movies since they were shot monochrome and hand-colored or machine-colored afterwards. (Such movies are referred to as \"colored\" and not \"color\".) The earliest such example is the hand-tinted Annabelle Serpentine Dance in 1895 by Edison Manufacturing Company. Machine-based tinting later became popular. Tinting continued until the advent of natural color cinematography in the 1910s. Many black and white movies have been colorized recently using digital tinting. This includes footage shot from both world wars, sporting events and political propaganda.\n", "The real push for color films and the nearly immediate changeover from black-and-white production to nearly all color film were pushed forward by the prevalence of television in the early 1950s. In 1947, only 12 percent of American films were made in color. By 1954, that number rose to over 50 percent. The rise in color films was also aided by the breakup of Technicolor's near monopoly on the medium.\n", "Cinecolor was also prominently employed in processing Paramount's \"Popular Science\" series of short films \u2013 although later prints were made by Consolidated Film Industries under their Magnacolor process. Hal Roach Studios made all four of its features in Cinecolor in 1947\u20131948, becoming the first Hollywood studio to do an all-color schedule. The last American feature released in Cinecolor was Allied Artists' \"Pride of the Blue Grass\" (1954). \n", "In late 1934, Pioneer contracted with Technicolor to make nine features in the full color process, and hired RKO's Merian C. Cooper to be its vice-president in charge of production. \"Becky Sharp\" (1935), an adaptation of Thackeray's novel \"Vanity Fair\", became the first feature-length motion picture in full color, followed by \"Dancing Pirate\" (1936).\n", "By 1932, musicals were declining in popularity, and the studio was forced to cut musical numbers from many productions and advertise them as straight comedies. The public had begun to associate musicals with color, and thus studios began to abandon its use. Warner Bros. had a contract with Technicolor to produce two more pictures in that process. As a result, the first horror films in color were produced and released by the studio: \"Doctor X\" (1932) and \"Mystery of the Wax Museum\" (1933). In the latter part of 1931, Harry Warner rented the Teddington Studios in London, England. The studio focused on making \"quota quickies\" for the domestic British market and Irving Asher was appointed as the studio's head producer. In 1934, Harry officially purchased the Teddington Studios.\n", "The proliferation of television in the early 1950s contributed to a heavy mid-century push for color within the film industry. In 1947, only 12 percent of American films were made in color. By 1954, that number had risen to over 50 percent. The color boom was aided by the breakup of Technicolor's near-monopoly on the medium. The last stand of black-and-white films made by or released through the major Hollywood studios came in the mid-1960s, after which the use of color film for all productions was effectively mandatory and exceptions were only rarely and grudgingly made.\n", "From its birth in the 1880s, movies were predominantly monochrome. Contrary to popular belief, monochrome doesn't always mean black and white; it means a movie shot in a single tone or color. Since the cost of tinted film bases was substantially higher, most movies were produced in black and white monochrome. Even with the advent of early color experiments, the greater expense of color meant films were mostly made in black and white until the 1950s, when cheaper color processes were introduced, and in some years the percentage of films shot on color film surpassed 51%. By the 1960s, color became by far the dominant film stock. In the coming decades, the usage of color film greatly increased while monochrome films became scarce.\n", "One of the first movies to use subtractive color was a silent film titled \"Cupid Angling\" (1918). In 1932, Walt Disney made the first film to use a red, green and blue color process (Technicolor), \"Flowers and Trees\". Three years later, the first feature length movie to be filmed entirely in 3-color Technicolor was \"Becky Sharp\".\n", "In the early 1950s, the proliferation of black-and-white television started seriously depressing North American theater attendance. In an attempt to lure audiences back into theaters, bigger screens were installed, widescreen processes, polarized 3D projection, and stereophonic sound were introduced, and more films were made in color, which soon became the rule rather than the exception. Some important mainstream Hollywood films were still being made in black-and-white as late as the mid-1960s, but they marked the end of an era. Color television receivers had been available in the US since the mid-1950s, but at first, they were very expensive and few broadcasts were in color. During the 1960s, prices gradually came down, color broadcasts became common, and sales boomed. The overwhelming public verdict in favor of color was clear. After the final flurry of black-and-white films had been released in mid-decade, all Hollywood studio productions were filmed in color, with the usual exceptions made only at the insistence of \"star\" filmmakers such as Peter Bogdanovich and Martin Scorsese.\n"], "__answers__": ["introduced around 1940", "1895"]}}
