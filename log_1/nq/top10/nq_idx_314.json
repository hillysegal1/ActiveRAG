This means that children typically did not have SSNs until they reached working age or needed one for other purposes, such as tax deductions or health insurance.\n\n3. **Legislative Changes and Policy Shifts**: The Tax Reform Act of 1986 marked a significant shift in the use of SSNs. It required parents to provide SSNs for dependents over the age of 5 to claim tax deductions. This legislative change created a direct incentive for parents to obtain SSNs for their children, leading to a gradual shift in practice.\n\n4. **Further Policy Adjustments**: Subsequent amendments in 1988 and 1990 lowered the age threshold for requiring SSNs for tax purposes to 2 years and then to 1 year, respectively. These changes further encouraged parents to apply for SSNs at an earlier age, establishing a new norm of obtaining SSNs at or shortly after birth.\n\n5. **Official Policy Implementation**: By 1987, the Social Security Administration (SSA) officially allowed parents to apply for SSNs for their newborns. This was part of a broader effort to streamline the process and ensure that children could be identified and tracked from birth, reflecting the evolving role of SSNs in American society.\n\n6. **Current Practice**: Today, it is common for parents to apply for SSNs for their children soon after birth, often during the application for a birth certificate. This practice has become standard, indicating a significant cultural shift in how SSNs are perceived and utilized.\n\n7. **Causal Relationships**: The transition from issuing SSNs primarily for employment to requiring them at birth illustrates a clear causal relationship between legislative changes and social practices.

Fay of the Social Security Administration selected a record from the top of the first stack of 1,000 records and announced that the first Social Security number in history was assigned to John David Sweeney, Jr., of New Rochelle, New York.\n", "List showing the geographical location of the first three digits of the social security numbers assigned in the United States and its territories from 1973 until June 25 2011. Repeated numbers indicate that they have been transferred to another location or they're shared by more than one location.\n", "In the United States, it was formerly the case that citizens were not issued a Social Security number until their first paid employment. Thus, in the year 1975, a man ghoster aged 25 would acquire the birth certificate of a boy who was born circa 1950 (the same age as the ghoster) but who had died at age 15 or younger. An individual who died before adulthood would not be likely to possess a Social Security number; therefore, a ghoster claiming to be this person and applying for a first-time Social Security number at age 25 would not arouse suspicion if he could explain why he waited until age 25 to begin working for wages. But a ghoster who attempted this scheme in the year 2000 (or later) would arouse great suspicion because parents are now required to acquire a Social Security number for their offspring before the next annual income tax return is filed, and government computers can instantly retrieve any individual's entire history of employment and income-tax records. A ghoster who applies to a Social Security office for a replacement of a Social Security card issued to someone who died ten years earlier (who claims to be that individual, still living) will immediately be asked why he has not reported any wages for the past ten years and will be challenged to explain how he has supported himself for ten years without wages. There will also be a gap in the tax records, requiring the ghoster to explain why he hasn't filed tax returns for the intervening years.\n", "After 1969, the Army completely converted to Social Security numbers for the identification of military personnel.\n", "Social Security numbers have its origins in the social security legislation in 1962. At that time its dual enrollment to citizens and residents was available so it was not performed properly. Then in 1968, after the \u2018Kim Shin -jo incident\u2019, when North Korean special forces stormed The Blue House, it amended the Social Security Act because Spy identifies were given a number to each citizen.\n", "When it was introduced in 1947 it was probably the first of its kind covering the total resident population of a country (The Social Security number in the United States is older, but it did not cover the whole population). Numbers are issued by the Swedish Tax Agency (Swedish: \"Skatteverket\") as part of the population register (Swedish: \"Folkbokf\u00f6ring\"). Until 1967, it had nine digits, and after that 10 digits.\n", "Before 1986, people often did not obtain a Social Security number until the age of about 14, since the numbers were used for income tracking purposes, and those under that age seldom had substantial income. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 required parents to list Social Security numbers for each dependent over the age of 5 for whom the parent wanted to claim a tax deduction. Before this act, parents claiming tax deductions were simply trusted not to lie about the number of children they supported. During the first year of the Tax Reform Act, this anti-fraud change resulted in seven million fewer minor dependents being claimed. The disappearance of these dependents is believed to have involved either children who never existed or tax deductions improperly claimed by non-custodial parents. In 1988, the threshold was lowered to two years old, and in 1990, the threshold was lowered yet again to one year old. Today, an SSN is required regardless of the child's age to receive an exemption. Since then, parents have often applied for Social Security numbers for their children soon after birth; today, it can be done on the application for a birth certificate.\n", "The SSN was created to ensure accurate reporting of a worker's wages to the Social Security Administration. Prior to 1986, it was common to apply for a SSN shortly before it might be needed, most often when a teenager. Tax reform acts of 1986, 1988, and 1990 required parents to supply the SSN of children over age 5, 2, or 1 respectively, to receive an income tax deduction for the child. This led to parents applying for their children's SSN at birth.\n"], "__answers__": ["1990"]}}
