These structures can include tombs, monuments, and ceremonial sites. The term encompasses various forms, including portal tombs, dolmens, menhirs, and stone circles.\n\n2. **Identifying Common Forms**: In Europe, several forms of megalithic architecture exist. Among these, **portal tombs** are identified as the most common type, characterized by upright stones (orthostats) topped with large flat capstones. These structures often serve as burial sites, although their primary function may vary.\n\n3. **Researching Commonality**: While stone circles, such as **Stonehenge**, are iconic and widely recognized for their cultural and historical significance, they are not as prevalent in number compared to portal tombs. The prevalence of portal tombs across various regions in Europe, including notable examples in northwest France and Malta, indicates their commonality.\n\n4. **Comparing Other Forms**: Dolmens and menhirs are also significant, but the sheer number of portal tombs and their widespread distribution across Europe suggest that they are the most common form of megalithic architecture.
