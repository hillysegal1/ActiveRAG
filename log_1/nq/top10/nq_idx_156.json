In 1923, Arnold Schoenberg (1874\u20131951) developed his own, better-known version of 12-tone technique, which became associated with the \"Second Viennese School\" composers, who were the primary users of the technique in the first decades of its existence. The technique is a means of ensuring that all 12 notes of the chromatic scale are sounded as often as one another in a piece of music while preventing the emphasis of any one note through the use of tone rows, orderings of the 12 pitch classes. All 12 notes are thus given more or less equal importance, and the music avoids being in a key. Over time, the technique increased greatly in popularity and eventually became widely influential on 20th-century composers. Many important composers who had originally not subscribed to or even actively opposed the technique, such as Aaron Copland and Igor Stravinsky, eventually adopted it in their music.\\n', 'BULLET::::- The twelve-tone technique (also dodecaphony) is a method of musical composition devised by Arnold Schoenberg.

Later, his name would come to personify innovations in atonality (although Schoenberg himself detested that term) that would become the most polemical feature of 20th-century art music. In the 1920s, Schoenberg developed the twelve-tone technique, an influential compositional method of manipulating an ordered series of all twelve notes in the chromatic scale. He also coined the term developing variation and was the first modern composer to embrace ways of developing motifs without resorting to the dominance of a centralized melodic idea.\\n', 'In the early 1920s, he worked at evolving a means of order that would make his musical texture simpler and clearer. This resulted in the \"method of composing with twelve tones which are related only with one another\" , in which the twelve pitches of the octave (unrealized compositionally) are regarded as equal, and no one note or tonality is given the emphasis it occupied in classical harmony. He regarded it as the equivalent in music of Albert Einstein\\'s discoveries in physics. Schoenberg announced it characteristically, during a walk with his friend Josef Rufer, when he said, \"I have made a discovery which will ensure the supremacy of German music for the next hundred years\" .

This concept was a significant precursor to Schoenberg's more developed and widely adopted version of the technique.\n\nThe contextual relationships surrounding the twelve-tone system are crucial for understanding its significance. The emergence of this technique coincided with a broader cultural shift in the early 20th century, marked by a move away from traditional forms of expression in art and music. Schoenberg's development of the twelve-tone system was also influenced by the political upheaval of the time, particularly the rise of the Nazis, which led to his emigration to Los Angeles. This context of artistic survival and innovation further underscores the importance of Schoenberg's contributions to modern music.\n\nIn summary, while Josef Matthias Hauer played a foundational role in the early development of the twelve-tone system, it was Arnold Schoenberg who fully realized and popularized this revolutionary compositional method. His abandonment of traditional harmony in favor of the twelve-tone technique marked a pivotal moment in music history, influencing countless composers and reshaping the landscape of 20th-century music.\n\n**Answer:** Arnold Schoenberg."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nwho abandoned traditional harmony and created the twelve-tone system for composition\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The twelve-tone technique\u2014also known as dodecaphony, twelve-tone serialism, and (in British usage) twelve-note composition\u2014is a method of musical composition first devised by Austrian composer Josef Matthias Hauer, who published his \"law of the twelve tones\" in 1919.

Many important composers who had originally not subscribed to or even actively opposed the technique, such as Aaron Copland and Igor Stravinsky, eventually adopted it in their music.\n", "BULLET::::- The twelve-tone technique (also dodecaphony) is a method of musical composition devised by Arnold Schoenberg. Music using the technique is called twelve-tone music.\n", "BULLET::::- In the 1920s, Arnold Schoenberg developed the twelve-tone technique, which became widely influential on 20th-century composers.\n", "A second direction in the search for a new tonality was twelve-tone serialism. Arnold Schoenberg developed the twelve-tone method of composition as an alternative to the structure provided by the diatonic system. His method entails building a piece using a series of the twelve notes of the chromatic scale, permuting it and superimposing it on itself to create the composition.\n", "Schoenberg was known early in his career for simultaneously extending the traditionally opposed German Romantic styles of Brahms and Wagner. Later, his name would come to personify innovations in atonality (although Schoenberg himself detested that term) that would become the most polemical feature of 20th-century art music. In the 1920s, Schoenberg developed the twelve-tone technique, an influential compositional method of manipulating an ordered series of all twelve notes in the chromatic scale. He also coined the term developing variation and was the first modern composer to embrace ways of developing motifs without resorting to the dominance of a centralized melodic idea.\n", "In the early 1920s, he worked at evolving a means of order that would make his musical texture simpler and clearer. This resulted in the \"method of composing with twelve tones which are related only with one another\" , in which the twelve pitches of the octave (unrealized compositionally) are regarded as equal, and no one note or tonality is given the emphasis it occupied in classical harmony. He regarded it as the equivalent in music of Albert Einstein's discoveries in physics. Schoenberg announced it characteristically, during a walk with his friend Josef Rufer, when he said, \"I have made a discovery which will ensure the supremacy of German music for the next hundred years\" . This period included the \"Variations for Orchestra\", Op.\u00a031 (1928); \"Piano Pieces\", Opp.\u00a033a & b (1931), and the Piano Concerto, Op.\u00a042 (1942). Contrary to his reputation for strictness, Schoenberg's use of the technique varied widely according to the demands of each individual composition. Thus the structure of his unfinished opera \"Moses und Aron\" is unlike that of his \"Phantasy for Violin and Piano\", Op.\u00a047 (1949).\n", "In 1934 Tremblay\u2019s \"long-standing ambition\" to study under Arnold Schoenberg was realized when the composer emigrated from Europe to Los Angeles due to the rise of the Nazis under Adolf Hitler in 1933. Tremblay claims to have independently discovered the twelve-tone system of musical composition in the summer of 1933; upon telling Schoenberg, the master remarked that it was a natural thing to discover because it was the next logical development in tonality. Schoenberg, always willing to learn from his own students, supposedly was inspired to compose his \"Ode to Napoleon\" (1942) with a row of two symmetrical hexachords after hearing Tremblay\u2019s \"Modes of Transportation\" (1940) make use of a similar idea. Schoenberg is also reported to have been a great admirer of Tremblay\u2019s skill in improvising at the piano, claiming that \"[Tremblay] never plays a wrong note\" and advising him to simply write what he improvises. Tremblay and Schoenberg\u2019s friendship remained close and lasted until Schoenberg\u2019s death in 1951.\n", "In 1958, Miles Davis was one of many jazz musicians growing dissatisfied with bebop, seeing its increasingly complex chord changes as hindering musical creativity. Five years earlier, jazz pianist, composer and theorist George Russell published his \"Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization\" (1953), which offered an alternative to the practice of musical improvisation based on chords. Abandoning the traditional major and minor key relationships of classical music, Russell developed a new formulation using musical scales, or a series of scales, for improvisations. Russell's approach to improvisation came to be known as modal in jazz. Davis viewed Russell's methods of composition as a means of getting away from the dense chord-laden compositions of his time, which Davis had labeled as \"thick.\"\n", "Though the term was coined by Arnold Schoenberg, twentieth-century composer and inventor of the twelve-tone technique, he felt it was one of the most important compositional principles since around 1750:\n", "Though most sources will say it was invented by Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg in 1921 and first described privately to his associates in 1923, in fact Josef Matthias Hauer published his \"law of the twelve tones\" in 1919, and should be credited with inventing the technique, requiring that all twelve chromatic notes sound before any note is repeated. The method was used during the next twenty years almost exclusively by the composers of the Second Viennese School\u2014Alban Berg, Anton Webern, and Schoenberg himself.\n"], "__answers__": ["Arnold Schoenberg"]}}
