This extensive use highlights the chair's role as a primary method of capital punishment in New York.\n\n3. **Last Execution**:\n   - Eddie Lee Mays was the last person executed by the electric chair on August 15, 1963. This event is pivotal as it marks the end of an era for this method of execution in the state.\n\n4. **Abolition of Capital Punishment**:\n   - Following Mays' execution, New York state abolished capital punishment in 1965, indicating a significant societal shift in attitudes towards the death penalty. The electric chair, therefore, ceased to be a method of execution at this point.\n\n5. **Reinstatement and Legal Developments**:\n   - Capital punishment was reinstated in 1995, but the method used was lethal injection, not the electric chair. This change reflects evolving views on execution methods, with lethal injection being perceived as more humane.\n\n6. **Judicial Rulings**:\n   - In 2004, the New York Court of Appeals ruled in \"People v. LaValle\" that the death penalty was unconstitutional, leading to the abolition of capital punishment once again. This ruling underscores the legal complexities surrounding the death penalty and its methods.\n\n7. **Current Status**:\n   - The electric chair has not been used since 1963. The transition to lethal injection and the subsequent abolition of the death penalty in 2004 indicate a complete shift away from the electric chair as a method of execution.\n\n### Causal Relationships:\n- The timeline of events illustrates a clear causal relationship: the last execution by electric chair led to the abolition of capital punishment in 1965, and subsequent legal rulings further solidified the end of capital punishment in New York.\n\n### Legal and Social Context:\n- The societal shift in attitudes towards capital punishment and the legal rulings reflect a broader trend in the United States regarding the death penalty, enhancing the model's understanding of the factors influencing these changes.\n\n### Statistical Data and Comparative Analysis:\n- The historical data on executions provides insight into the prevalence and eventual decline of the electric chair, allowing for a better understanding of its historical significance compared to other methods of execution.\n\n### Answer:\nNew York officially stopped using the electric chair after the last execution on August 15, 1963, when Eddie Lee Mays was executed. The state abolished capital punishment in 1965, and although the death penalty was reinstated in 1995, it was done using lethal injection, not the electric chair. The electric chair has not been used since 1963, and capital punishment was abolished again in 2004 following a court ruling."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhen did new york stop using the electric chair\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['In its 75 years of operation, a total of 695 men and women were executed by the electric chair in New York state (614 at Sing Sing).
