This is supported by the information that children transition to preschool age around this time.\n\n3. **Consider Developmental Milestones**: The toddler years are marked by rapid cognitive, emotional, and social development. Key milestones during this period include improved language skills, emotional regulation, and social interactions. The transition out of toddlerhood may be associated with achieving these milestones.\n\n4. **Acknowledge Overlapping Behaviors**: While three-year-olds are typically no longer classified as toddlers, they may still exhibit some toddler-like behaviors. This suggests that developmental stages are not strictly linear, and some characteristics may persist beyond the defined age range.\n\n5. **Physical Growth and Environmental Changes**: The transition from a toddler bed to a regular bed usually occurs between ages five and seven. This indicates that physical growth and changes in sleeping arrangements can also signify the end of toddlerhood, further emphasizing that development is influenced by various factors beyond just age.\n\n6. **Contextual Factors**: Understanding that developmental stages can be influenced by environmental and contextual factors broadens the model's perspective on causality. For example, a child's readiness for preschool may depend on their individual developmental pace rather than strictly adhering to age-based categories.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Based on the information gathered, it is reasonable to conclude that while the toddler stage officially ends at age 3, the transition to the next developmental stage involves a combination of age, developmental milestones, and individual characteristics.\n\n### Answer:\nYou are no longer a toddler at the age of 3, although some behaviors associated with toddlerhood may persist beyond this age. The transition to preschool age typically occurs around this time, marking a significant shift in developmental expectations."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nat what age are you no longer a toddler\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['A toddler is a child 12 to 36 months old.
