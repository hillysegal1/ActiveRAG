However, the language model's previous reasoning incorrectly stated that Lucius does not have a clearly defined father. According to the retrieved knowledge, **Gaius Fulcinius is identified as the father of Lucius**. This is a crucial detail that clarifies Lucius's parentage and corrects the earlier assertion that his biological father is not mentioned.\n\nAdditionally, while Lucius is seen in the company of Maximus, who acts as a father figure, it is important to recognize that Gaius Fulcinius is his actual father.
