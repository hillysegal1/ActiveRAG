This historical context is crucial for understanding their long-standing affiliation with the league.\n\n2. **Ownership Change**: The sale of the Astros to new owner Jim Crane was a pivotal event that influenced the decision to move leagues. This ownership change can be seen as a catalyst for organizational restructuring and strategic realignment.\n\n3. **Decision to Move**: In 2013, Major League Baseball implemented a significant realignment that included the Astros transitioning from the National League to the American League. This decision was not arbitrary; it was part of a broader strategy to balance the number of teams in each league, addressing the disparity where the American League had 14 teams and the National League had 16 teams.\n\n4. **Effective Move**: The Astros officially became a member of the American League West division starting with the 2013 season. This move was not just a change in league but also involved a shift in competitive dynamics, as they joined the Texas Rangers and other teams in the American League West.\n\n5. **Impact of League Structure Changes**: The transition was part of a larger restructuring of Major League Baseball, which aimed to create an odd number of teams in each league (15 in each). This restructuring facilitated expanded interleague play, allowing for more frequent matchups between teams from different leagues.\n\n6. **Temporal Sequencing**: The sequence of events is important: the Astros' last season in the National League was 2012, followed by the ownership change, and then the effective move in 2013. Understanding this timeline helps the model infer that the ownership change was a significant precursor to the league transition.\n\n7. **Contextual Awareness**: Recognizing the motivations behind the Astros' move, such as the desire for expanded interleague play and the need for competitive balance, enhances the model's ability to make logical inferences about organizational decisions in sports and other domains.\n\n8. **Generalization to Other Domains**: The reasoning process can be generalized to other contexts, such as business mergers or organizational restructuring, where leadership changes and strategic decisions lead to significant shifts in operations.\n\n### Answer:\nThe Houston Astros changed from the National League to the American League in 2013, following their last season in the National League in 2012. This transition was influenced by the sale of the team to new owner Jim Crane and was part of a broader realignment in Major League Baseball aimed at balancing the number of teams in each league and facilitating expanded interleague play.
