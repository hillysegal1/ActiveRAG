This diversity indicates their adaptability and ecological significance beyond just the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n2. **Soil Presence**: Bacteroidetes are abundant in the rhizosphere, which is the region of soil influenced by plant roots. They have been detected in various soil types, including cultivated fields and unexploited areas. This suggests that they play a role in soil health and nutrient cycling, which is crucial for plant growth.\n\n3. **Aquatic Environments**: In addition to terrestrial habitats, Bacteroidetes inhabit freshwater lakes, rivers, and oceans.
