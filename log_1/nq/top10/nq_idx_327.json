The success of the first two series likely influences the decision to produce subsequent series.\n\n3. **Cultural and Bilingual Considerations**:\n   - The bilingual nature of the show (produced in both English and Welsh) indicates a broader audience reach, which may further encourage the network to invest in new series. This cultural aspect can also lead to increased viewer engagement and interest in future episodes.\n\n4. **Impact of Awards**:\n   - The recognition received by the show's creator, Matthew Hall, who won a Welsh BAFTA for best writer, suggests that critical acclaim can lead to increased interest and potential funding for new series.

However, based on the historical patterns and the show's popularity, it is plausible that if a new series is in the works, it would follow a similar timeline to previous productions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile I cannot provide a specific release date for the new series of \"Keeping Faith,\" the historical context suggests that if a new series is being produced, it may follow a timeline similar to past series, typically airing within a year or so after production begins. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, checking official sources or entertainment news is recommended.\n\n### Answer:\nAs of my last update in October 2023, I do not have a specific release date for the new series of \"Keeping Faith.\" However, based on historical patterns, if a new series is in production, it may follow a timeline similar to previous series.
