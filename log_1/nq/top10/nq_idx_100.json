There Ulbricht told Pervukhin that if the Soviets did not react soon, East Germany would \"collapse\". Pervukhin discussed other problems as well, claiming that Ulbricht but also the East German leadership in general, were opposed to the Soviet Union\\'s plan to improve relations with West Germany. When Khrushchev gave his approval to construct what would become the Berlin Wall, Pervukhin was the first to know. Ulbricht told Pervukhin of the need to create the East\u2013West barrier at night, and he and Khrushchev would later agree to this.\\n', 'In 1975 he was sent back to Berlin where he served a second stint as Soviet ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, remaining in post this time till 1983. His years as ambassador were not without Soviet-East German tensions. During the early 1960s the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev was interested in exploring a less confrontational relationship with the west while the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht, remained uncompromisingly hard-line in his attitude to the west in general and in his country\\'s relationship with West Germany specifically. The decision suddenly to erect the Berlin Wall in August 1961 was naturally taken by the East Germans in full consultation with the Soviet ambassador. From the East German perspective The Wall represented a necessary desperate attempt to save the state which appeared to be in the process of losing its entire working age population. With Abrassimov as Soviet ambassador in Berlin, Walter Ulbricht, who had earlier enjoyed close relations with Soviet leader Josef Stalin, found he enjoyed far less direct contact with the Soviet leadership in Moscow. In 1963/64, when Ulbricht moved to control air traffic flying into West Berlin, it was Abrassimov who prevented the move. He actively opposed East German reluctance to conclude a belated post war peace treaty with West Germany, and in 1966 set up direct links with Willy Brandt, then the mayor of West Berlin, without telling the leadership of the East German ruling SED (party). Abrassimov also participated regularly in meetings of the East German cabinet, something which had never happened when Mikhail Pervukhin was the Soviet ambassador. The relationship between the Soviet ambassador and the East German leadership did not improve with the appointment of a new East German leader, Erich Honecker, in 1971. During the 1980s Abrassimov\\'s growing propensity to meet regularly with western ambassadors to Berlin without reference to his East German host government did not help matters. In 1983 he was seen to be becoming ever more paternalistic and autocratic in his ambassadorial office, and following the death of Leonid Brezhnev at the end of 1982, Honecker managed to persuade Moscow to replace Abrassimov because of the extent of his \"interference in East German domestic politics\".\\n', 'Walter Ulbricht (1893\u20131973) was the party boss from 1950 to 1971. In 1933, Ulbricht had fled to Moscow, where he served as a Comintern agent loyal to Stalin. As World War II was ending, Stalin assigned him the job of designing the postwar German system that would centralize all power in the Communist Party. Ulbricht became deputy prime minister in 1949 and secretary (chief executive) of the Socialist Unity (Communist) party in 1950. Some 2.6 million people had fled East Germany by 1961 when he built the Berlin Wall to stop them \u2014 shooting those who attempted it. What the GDR called the \"Anti-Fascist Protective Wall\" was a major embarrassment for the program during the Cold War, but it did stabilize East Germany and postpone its collapse. Ulbricht lost power in 1971, but was kept on as a nominal head of state. He was replaced because he failed to solve growing national crises, such as the worsening economy in 1969\u201370, the fear of another popular uprising as had occurred in 1953, and the disgruntlement between Moscow and Berlin caused by Ulbricht\\'s d\u00e9tente policies toward the West.\\n', \"After World War II, Germans tended to prefer living in West Germany over East Germany, and Berlin became a major escape route for people wanting to leave the Soviet sphere of influence for the West. This led to major-power conflict over Berlin that stretched at least from 1946 to the construction of the Berlin wall in 1961. After U.S. President Truman was replaced by Eisenhower in 1953 and Khrushchev became Soviet head of state in 1958, Khrushchev tried to push Eisenhower on Berlin in 1958-59.

Stalin agreed, calling the situation \"intolerable\". He advised the East Germans to build up their border defenses, telling them that \"The demarcation line between East and West Germany should be considered a border\u2014and not just any border, but a dangerous one ...

In 1987, US President Ronald Reagan gave a speech at the Brandenburg Gate, challenging Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to \"tear down the wall\" which divided Berlin. The wall had stood as an icon for the political and economic division between East and West, a division that Churchill had referred to as the \"Iron Curtain\".

In early 1989, under a new era of Soviet policies of \"glasnost\" (openness), \"perestroika\" (economic restructuring) and taken further by Gorbachev, the Solidarity movement took hold in Poland. Further inspired by other images of brave defiance, a wave of revolutions swept throughout the Eastern Bloc that year.

At that time, Nikita Khrushchev was the leader of the Soviet Union, having held power from 1953 until 1964. This timeline is crucial as it directly links Khrushchev to the events surrounding the Wall's construction.\n\n2. **Khrushchev's Role**:\n   - Khrushchev's agreement with East German leader Walter Ulbricht to allow the construction of the Berlin Wall indicates his direct involvement in this significant Cold War event. His leadership style was characterized by attempts to navigate a less confrontational relationship with the West, which contrasted with Ulbricht's hardline stance.\n\n3. **Context of the Berlin Wall**:\n   - The construction of the Berlin Wall was a response to the mass emigration of East Germans to West Germany, which had reached approximately 2.6 million people by 1961. This mass exodus created a crisis for the East German government, prompting the need for a physical barrier to prevent further emigration. The Wall was not just a physical structure but a symbol of the ideological divide between the Eastern Bloc and the West.\n\n4. **Consequences of the Berlin Wall**:\n   - Khrushchev acknowledged that the Wall had successfully stemmed the exodus of citizens from East Germany and stabilized the East German economy. This reflects the immediate impact of the Wall on East Germany's political landscape and its role in maintaining the regime's control.\n\n5. **Historical Context of the Cold War**:\n   - Understanding the broader historical context is essential. After World War II, many Germans preferred living in West Germany, leading to significant tensions over Berlin, which became a focal point of Cold War conflict. The Wall represented not only a physical barrier but also a profound ideological division that characterized the era.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis of the timeline, Khrushchev's role, the context of the Berlin Wall's construction, and the broader historical implications, it is clear that Nikita Khrushchev was the leader of the Soviet Union at the time the Berlin Wall was built. His leadership was instrumental in the decision-making process that led to the Wall's construction, which served as a critical symbol of the Cold War.\n\n### Answer:\nNikita Khrushchev"}], "associate": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a cognitive scientist focused on understanding the contextual relationships between information.

This emigration posed a significant threat to the stability of the East German state, prompting the East German government, led by Walter Ulbricht, to seek Soviet approval for the construction of the Wall. Khrushchev's agreement during a visit to East Germany highlights the collaborative decision-making process between the Soviet Union and East Germany.\n\n3. **Political Dynamics**: The relationship between Khrushchev and Ulbricht is crucial for understanding the motivations behind the Wall's construction. While Khrushchev was interested in reducing tensions with the West, Ulbricht maintained a hardline approach. This tension illustrates the complexities of Cold War politics, where the Soviet Union had to balance its influence over Eastern Bloc countries while addressing internal pressures.\n\n4. **Symbolism of the Berlin Wall**: The Wall became a powerful symbol of the Cold War, representing the ideological divide between the Eastern Bloc and the West. Khrushchev's leadership during this period was marked by attempts to navigate these tensions, and the construction of the Wall was a significant event that solidified the division of Berlin and, by extension, Europe.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The analysis of the passages confirms that Nikita Khrushchev was indeed the leader of the Soviet Union when the Berlin Wall was built. His role in approving the Wall's construction was pivotal, reflecting the broader geopolitical dynamics of the time and the urgent need for the East German government to maintain control over its population.\n\n**Answer:**\nNikita Khrushchev"}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nwho was the leader of the soviet union when the berlin wall was built\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['BULLET::::- On a visit to East Germany, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev agreed to let DDR leader Walter Ulbricht order construction of the Berlin Wall.\\n', 'Heinz Sokolowski (17 December 1917 \u2013 25 November 1965) was a German man who became the sixty-fourth known person to die at the Berlin Wall. Sokolowski, a former political prisoner, was shot and killed by East German border troops while attempting to cross the Berlin Wall near to the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag building.\\n', 'Walter Ulbricht, the East German leader, invited Pervukhin to his summer house to discuss the East German immigration flow to West Germany. There Ulbricht told Pervukhin that if the Soviets did not react soon, East Germany would \"collapse\". Pervukhin discussed other problems as well, claiming that Ulbricht but also the East German leadership in general, were opposed to the Soviet Union\\'s plan to improve relations with West Germany. When Khrushchev gave his approval to construct what would become the Berlin Wall, Pervukhin was the first to know. Ulbricht told Pervukhin of the need to create the East\u2013West barrier at night, and he and Khrushchev would later agree to this.\\n', 'In 1975 he was sent back to Berlin where he served a second stint as Soviet ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, remaining in post this time till 1983. His years as ambassador were not without Soviet-East German tensions. During the early 1960s the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev was interested in exploring a less confrontational relationship with the west while the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht, remained uncompromisingly hard-line in his attitude to the west in general and in his country\\'s relationship with West Germany specifically. The decision suddenly to erect the Berlin Wall in August 1961 was naturally taken by the East Germans in full consultation with the Soviet ambassador. From the East German perspective The Wall represented a necessary desperate attempt to save the state which appeared to be in the process of losing its entire working age population. With Abrassimov as Soviet ambassador in Berlin, Walter Ulbricht, who had earlier enjoyed close relations with Soviet leader Josef Stalin, found he enjoyed far less direct contact with the Soviet leadership in Moscow. In 1963/64, when Ulbricht moved to control air traffic flying into West Berlin, it was Abrassimov who prevented the move. He actively opposed East German reluctance to conclude a belated post war peace treaty with West Germany, and in 1966 set up direct links with Willy Brandt, then the mayor of West Berlin, without telling the leadership of the East German ruling SED (party). Abrassimov also participated regularly in meetings of the East German cabinet, something which had never happened when Mikhail Pervukhin was the Soviet ambassador. The relationship between the Soviet ambassador and the East German leadership did not improve with the appointment of a new East German leader, Erich Honecker, in 1971. During the 1980s Abrassimov\\'s growing propensity to meet regularly with western ambassadors to Berlin without reference to his East German host government did not help matters. In 1983 he was seen to be becoming ever more paternalistic and autocratic in his ambassadorial office, and following the death of Leonid Brezhnev at the end of 1982, Honecker managed to persuade Moscow to replace Abrassimov because of the extent of his \"interference in East German domestic politics\".\\n', 'Walter Ulbricht (1893\u20131973) was the party boss from 1950 to 1971. In 1933, Ulbricht had fled to Moscow, where he served as a Comintern agent loyal to Stalin. As World War II was ending, Stalin assigned him the job of designing the postwar German system that would centralize all power in the Communist Party. Ulbricht became deputy prime minister in 1949 and secretary (chief executive) of the Socialist Unity (Communist) party in 1950. Some 2.6 million people had fled East Germany by 1961 when he built the Berlin Wall to stop them \u2014 shooting those who attempted it. What the GDR called the \"Anti-Fascist Protective Wall\" was a major embarrassment for the program during the Cold War, but it did stabilize East Germany and postpone its collapse. Ulbricht lost power in 1971, but was kept on as a nominal head of state. He was replaced because he failed to solve growing national crises, such as the worsening economy in 1969\u201370, the fear of another popular uprising as had occurred in 1953, and the disgruntlement between Moscow and Berlin caused by Ulbricht\\'s d\u00e9tente policies toward the West.\\n', \"After World War II, Germans tended to prefer living in West Germany over East Germany, and Berlin became a major escape route for people wanting to leave the Soviet sphere of influence for the West. This led to major-power conflict over Berlin that stretched at least from 1946 to the construction of the Berlin wall in 1961. After U.S. President Truman was replaced by Eisenhower in 1953 and Khrushchev became Soviet head of state in 1958, Khrushchev tried to push Eisenhower on Berlin in 1958-59.

His tenure lasted from 1953 until 1964, making him the relevant figure during this pivotal moment in Cold War history.\n\n3. **Khrushchev's Involvement**: Khrushchev's direct involvement is highlighted in the passages, where it is noted that he agreed to allow East German leader Walter Ulbricht to construct the Wall. This indicates that Khrushchev not only held the title of leader but also played an active role in the decision-making process that led to the Wall's construction.\n\n4. **Socio-Political Context**: The urgency behind the Wall's construction stemmed from a significant emigration crisis, with approximately 2.6 million East Germans fleeing to West Germany by 1961. This mass exodus posed a threat to the stability of the East German state, prompting leaders like Ulbricht to seek Khrushchev's approval for drastic measures.\n\n5. **Consequences of the Wall**: Khrushchev later acknowledged that the Wall had successfully stemmed the flow of emigration and stabilized the East German economy. This reflects the Wall's intended purpose as a physical barrier to prevent citizens from leaving, thereby reinforcing Soviet influence in Eastern Europe.\n\n6. **Causal Relationships**: The reasoning process demonstrates a clear cause-and-effect relationship: the emigration crisis led to the decision to build the Wall, which was sanctioned by Khrushchev.

Specifically, one passage states, \"On a visit to East Germany, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev agreed to let DDR leader Walter Ulbricht order construction of the Berlin Wall.\" This indicates Khrushchev's direct involvement in the decision-making process regarding the Wall.\n\n2. **Decision-Making Context**: The construction of the Berlin Wall was a response to the mass emigration of East Germans to West Germany, which was causing significant demographic and political challenges for the East German government. The passage notes that the decision to erect the Wall was taken \"in full consultation with the Soviet ambassador,\" highlighting the collaborative nature of the decision between East German leaders and the Soviet Union.\n\n3. **Historical Timeline**: The context of Khrushchev's leadership is further supported by the passage that mentions, \"After U.S. President Truman was replaced by Eisenhower in 1953 and Khrushchev became Soviet head of state in 1958,\" establishing the timeline of his leadership during this pivotal moment in history.\n\n4. **Impact of the Wall**: Khrushchev's acknowledgment of the Wall's purpose is also significant. He stated that the Wall had \"accomplished its purpose of stemming the exodus of citizens from the nation and stabilized the East German economy.\" This illustrates the Wall's intended function as a barrier to prevent emigration and maintain the stability of the East German state.\n\nBy synthesizing this information, we can confidently assert that Nikita Khrushchev was the leader of the Soviet Union when the Berlin Wall was built. This understanding aligns with the historical context and helps to clarify any potential misconceptions regarding the timeline and leadership during this era.\n\n**Answer:**\nNikita Khrushchev"}], "question_info": {"question": "who was the leader of the soviet union when the berlin wall was built", "passages": ["BULLET::::- On a visit to East Germany, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev agreed to let DDR leader Walter Ulbricht order construction of the Berlin Wall.\n", "Heinz Sokolowski (17 December 1917 \u2013 25 November 1965) was a German man who became the sixty-fourth known person to die at the Berlin Wall. Sokolowski, a former political prisoner, was shot and killed by East German border troops while attempting to cross the Berlin Wall near to the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag building.\n", "Walter Ulbricht, the East German leader, invited Pervukhin to his summer house to discuss the East German immigration flow to West Germany. There Ulbricht told Pervukhin that if the Soviets did not react soon, East Germany would \"collapse\". Pervukhin discussed other problems as well, claiming that Ulbricht but also the East German leadership in general, were opposed to the Soviet Union's plan to improve relations with West Germany. When Khrushchev gave his approval to construct what would become the Berlin Wall, Pervukhin was the first to know. Ulbricht told Pervukhin of the need to create the East\u2013West barrier at night, and he and Khrushchev would later agree to this.\n", "In 1975 he was sent back to Berlin where he served a second stint as Soviet ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, remaining in post this time till 1983. His years as ambassador were not without Soviet-East German tensions. During the early 1960s the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev was interested in exploring a less confrontational relationship with the west while the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht, remained uncompromisingly hard-line in his attitude to the west in general and in his country's relationship with West Germany specifically. The decision suddenly to erect the Berlin Wall in August 1961 was naturally taken by the East Germans in full consultation with the Soviet ambassador. From the East German perspective The Wall represented a necessary desperate attempt to save the state which appeared to be in the process of losing its entire working age population. With Abrassimov as Soviet ambassador in Berlin, Walter Ulbricht, who had earlier enjoyed close relations with Soviet leader Josef Stalin, found he enjoyed far less direct contact with the Soviet leadership in Moscow. In 1963/64, when Ulbricht moved to control air traffic flying into West Berlin, it was Abrassimov who prevented the move. He actively opposed East German reluctance to conclude a belated post war peace treaty with West Germany, and in 1966 set up direct links with Willy Brandt, then the mayor of West Berlin, without telling the leadership of the East German ruling SED (party). Abrassimov also participated regularly in meetings of the East German cabinet, something which had never happened when Mikhail Pervukhin was the Soviet ambassador. The relationship between the Soviet ambassador and the East German leadership did not improve with the appointment of a new East German leader, Erich Honecker, in 1971. During the 1980s Abrassimov's growing propensity to meet regularly with western ambassadors to Berlin without reference to his East German host government did not help matters. In 1983 he was seen to be becoming ever more paternalistic and autocratic in his ambassadorial office, and following the death of Leonid Brezhnev at the end of 1982, Honecker managed to persuade Moscow to replace Abrassimov because of the extent of his \"interference in East German domestic politics\".\n", "Walter Ulbricht (1893\u20131973) was the party boss from 1950 to 1971. In 1933, Ulbricht had fled to Moscow, where he served as a Comintern agent loyal to Stalin. As World War II was ending, Stalin assigned him the job of designing the postwar German system that would centralize all power in the Communist Party. Ulbricht became deputy prime minister in 1949 and secretary (chief executive) of the Socialist Unity (Communist) party in 1950. Some 2.6 million people had fled East Germany by 1961 when he built the Berlin Wall to stop them \u2014 shooting those who attempted it. What the GDR called the \"Anti-Fascist Protective Wall\" was a major embarrassment for the program during the Cold War, but it did stabilize East Germany and postpone its collapse. Ulbricht lost power in 1971, but was kept on as a nominal head of state. He was replaced because he failed to solve growing national crises, such as the worsening economy in 1969\u201370, the fear of another popular uprising as had occurred in 1953, and the disgruntlement between Moscow and Berlin caused by Ulbricht's d\u00e9tente policies toward the West.\n", "After World War II, Germans tended to prefer living in West Germany over East Germany, and Berlin became a major escape route for people wanting to leave the Soviet sphere of influence for the West. This led to major-power conflict over Berlin that stretched at least from 1946 to the construction of the Berlin wall in 1961. After U.S. President Truman was replaced by Eisenhower in 1953 and Khrushchev became Soviet head of state in 1958, Khrushchev tried to push Eisenhower on Berlin in 1958-59. The Soviets backed down when Ike's resolve seemed to match that of Truman. When Ike was replaced by Kennedy in 1961, Khrushchev tried again, with essentially the same result.\n", "Up until 1952, the demarcation lines between East Germany and the western occupied zones could be easily crossed in most places. On 1 April 1952, East German leaders met the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in Moscow; during the discussions Stalin's foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov proposed that the East Germans should \"introduce a system of passes for visits of West Berlin residents to the territory of East Berlin [so as to stop] free movement of Western agents\" in the GDR. Stalin agreed, calling the situation \"intolerable\". He advised the East Germans to build up their border defenses, telling them that \"The demarcation line between East and West Germany should be considered a border\u2014and not just any border, but a dangerous one ... The Germans will guard the line of defence with their lives.\"\n", "In a speech at the Brandenburg Gate commemorating the 750th anniversary of Berlin on 12 June 1987, U.S. President Ronald Reagan challenged Mikhail Gorbachev, then the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to tear down the Wall as a symbol of increasing freedom in the Eastern Bloc:\n", "BULLET::::- Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev made a visit to the Berlin Wall from the East Berlin side, then delivered an address to the Communist leadership of East Germany at the SED Party Congress. Khrushchev stated bluntly that the Wall had accomplished its purpose of stemming the exodus of citizens from the nation and stabilized the East German economy, and added that further Soviet economic assistance would not be forthcoming. \"Neither God nor the devil will give you bread or butter if you do not manage it with your own hands,\" Khrushchev said, adding that East Germany \"must not expect alms from some rich uncle\".\n", "Into the 1980s, the Soviet Union experienced a period of economic and political stagnation, and correspondingly decreased intervention in Eastern Bloc politics. In 1987, US President Ronald Reagan gave a speech at the Brandenburg Gate, challenging Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to \"tear down the wall\" which divided Berlin. The wall had stood as an icon for the political and economic division between East and West, a division that Churchill had referred to as the \"Iron Curtain\". Gorbachev announced in 1988 that the Soviet Union would abandon the Brezhnev Doctrine and allow the Eastern bloc nations to freely determine their own internal affairs. In early 1989, under a new era of Soviet policies of \"glasnost\" (openness), \"perestroika\" (economic restructuring) and taken further by Gorbachev, the Solidarity movement took hold in Poland. Further inspired by other images of brave defiance, a wave of revolutions swept throughout the Eastern Bloc that year. In May 1989, Hungary removed their border fence and thousands of East Germans escaped to the West \u2014 although even then, very many people inside and outside Germany still believed that a real reunification would never happen in the foreseeable future.\n"], "__answers__": ["Khrushchev", "Joseph Stalin", "Nikita Khrushchev"]}}
