The model can be trained to discern which pieces of information are pertinent to a specific query, enhancing its ability to filter out irrelevant data.\n\n3. **Inference from Related Data**: While the passages do not provide the answer, they do contain information about the film's context (e.g., it being a sequel and the absence of the original dog star). This can help the model learn to make inferences about the film's production history and its implications for casting decisions.\n\n4. **Encouraging Comprehensive Searches**: The model can be trained to suggest alternative methods for finding information when direct answers are not available, such as looking up cast lists or using databases dedicated to film and television.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, while the passages do not contain the specific answer to the question about who plays Emma in \"Air Bud: World Pup,\" they provide insights into how to approach gaps in information, the relevance of context, and the importance of comprehensive searches.
