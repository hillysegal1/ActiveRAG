Que\" Smith wrote \"Best Thing I Never Had\" in collaboration with its producers Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds, Symbolyc One, Antonio Dixon, Shea Taylor, and Caleb McCampbell. According to Smith, \"Best Thing I Never Had\" is a ballad but was not originally written so; early demos sounded like late 1980s hip hop material. The main inspiration for the song was the drumming of Doug E. Fresh\\'s song \"The Show\" (1985). Smith told Gyant of Black Entertainment Television (BET) that he was initially intimidated at the prospect of working with Beyonc\u00e9. He was in Los Angeles when Tony Dixon telephoned him to say he and Edmonds were going to write some songs with Beyonc\u00e9.

Rich Juzwiak of \"The Village Voice\" wrote that the song is not as iconic as its reference point \"Irreplaceable\", but \"nor is it as shady\". He commended the optimism in the song\\'s lyrics. \"Consequence of Sound\" writer Chris Coplan commented that the ballad is a powerful moment of self-realization, which is enhanced by Beyonc\u00e9\\'s vocal performance \"as [a] wounded bird turned resilient lioness\".

The instrumentation includes a piano, stadium-sized bass drums, and strings. \"Best Thing I Never Had\" is thematically a kiss-off song; it is in this respect similar to Beyonc\u00e9\\'s own songs \"Irreplaceable\" (2006) and \"If I Were a Boy\" (2008).\\n', '\"Best Thing I Never Had\" is a song recorded by American singer Beyonc\u00e9 for her fourth studio album, \"4\" (2011).

Que\" Smith, Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds, Symbolyc One, Caleb McCambpell, Antonio Dixon, Beyonc\u00e9, and Shea Taylor.

The main inspiration for the song was the drumming of Doug E. Fresh\\'s song \"The Show\" (1985). Smith told Gyant of Black Entertainment Television (BET) that he was initially intimidated at the prospect of working with Beyonc\u00e9. He was in Los Angeles when Tony Dixon telephoned him to say he and Edmonds were going to write some songs with Beyonc\u00e9.

Rich Juzwiak of \"The Village Voice\" wrote that the song is not as iconic as its reference point \"Irreplaceable\", but \"nor is it as shady\". He commended the optimism in the song\\'s lyrics. \"Consequence of Sound\" writer Chris Coplan commented that the ballad is a powerful moment of self-realization, which is enhanced by Beyonc\u00e9\\'s vocal performance \"as [a] wounded bird turned resilient lioness\". Choosing \"Best Thing I Never Had\" as the highlight of \"4\", Andy Kellman of Allmusic described it as \"a bombastic kiss-off saved by Beyonc\u00e9\\'s ability to plow through it\".
