The playoffs typically occur in January, and the Steelers' participation is based on their regular-season record.\n\n1. **Regular Season Performance**: The Steelers finished the 2022 season with a record of 9-8, which allowed them to compete for a playoff spot. However, they did not qualify for the playoffs that year, as indicated by the passages provided.\n\n2. **Playoff Structure**: The NFL playoffs consist of multiple rounds: Wild Card, Divisional, Conference Championships, and the Super Bowl. Teams qualify for the playoffs based on their performance in the regular season, and the matchups are determined by seeding.\n\n3. **Outcome of Interest**: Since the Steelers did not make the playoffs in the 2022 season, they did not lose to any team in the playoffs that year. This is a crucial point that clarifies the misunderstanding in the previous answer.\n\n4. **Causal Relationships**: The Steelers' failure to qualify for the playoffs is a direct result of their regular-season performance. The passages indicate that they ended the season with a non-winning record, which eliminated them from playoff contention.\n\n5. **Logical Inference**: Given that the Steelers did not participate in the playoffs, it logically follows that they could not have lost to any team in that context.
