The Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, and each of the thirteen colonies had representatives who signed it.\n\nMaryland's representatives at the Continental Congress included several key figures who played significant roles in the American Revolution. The individuals who signed the Declaration of Independence on behalf of Maryland are:\n\n1. **Samuel Chase** - A prominent lawyer and politician who later served on the Supreme Court of Maryland.\n2. **William Paca** - A lawyer and politician who also served as the governor of Maryland.\n3. **Thomas Stone** - A planter and politician who was influential in Maryland's early government.\n4. **Charles Carroll of Carrollton** - Notably, he was one of the wealthiest men in the Americas at the time and the only Roman Catholic to vote on independence and sign the document. Carroll's wealth and influence were significant in garnering support for the revolution.\n\n### Historical Context:\n- Maryland declared its independence from Britain in 1776, aligning with the broader movement among the colonies to seek autonomy.\n- The signers were part of the Second Continental Congress, which was crucial in coordinating the colonies' efforts against British rule.\n\n### Causal Relationships:\n- The selection of these individuals as signers reflects their political influence, wealth, and commitment to the cause of independence. Their backgrounds suggest that their support was vital for rallying others in Maryland and beyond.\n- Understanding the implications of their actions helps to analyze how their decisions influenced the political landscape of Maryland and contributed to the success of the American Revolution.\n\n### Consequences and Logical Structuring:\n- The actions of these signers had long-term consequences for Maryland and the United States, shaping the governance and political structure of the new nation.\n- By recognizing the relationships between their backgrounds and their roles in the revolution, we can infer that their collective decision to sign the Declaration was a pivotal moment that helped solidify Maryland's commitment to independence.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy synthesizing this information, we can enhance the model's ability to understand the causal relationships and logical implications of historical events. This understanding allows for a more nuanced interpretation of how individual actions contribute to broader historical movements.\n\n### Answer:\nSamuel Chase, William Paca, Thomas Stone, and Charles Carroll of Carrollton signed the Declaration of Independence for Maryland.
