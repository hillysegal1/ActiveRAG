These terms refer to the religious and cultural practices surrounding the worship of the pantheon of gods from ancient Greek mythology, including deities like Zeus, Hera, and Poseidon. \n\n1. **Terminology**: The belief in Greek gods is specifically termed \"Hellenic Polytheism\" or \"Hellenismos.\" This encompasses both the historical worship of these gods in ancient Greece and the modern revival or reconstruction movements that seek to honor these deities today.\n\n2. **Cultural and Religious Framework**: Hellenic polytheism involves rituals, myths, and practices that are deeply rooted in the traditions of ancient Greece. It recognizes the gods as powerful beings who share human-like traits and interact with humanity, often influencing human affairs and experiences.\n\n3. **Philosophical Context**: The gods in Greek mythology are not considered evil; rather, their actions are often seen as part of a larger cosmic order, with fate playing a significant role in human experiences. This philosophical perspective allows for a nuanced understanding of divine intervention and human agency.\n\n4. **Modern Implications**: The term \"pagan\" has evolved, and modern practitioners of Hellenic polytheism may identify as pagans while also distinguishing their beliefs from other religious systems. This distinction is important for understanding how contemporary beliefs are shaped by historical contexts.\n\n5. **Interconnectedness of Beliefs**: By understanding the relationships between gods, human traits, and fate, we can better infer how these elements interact within the belief system. This interconnectedness enhances our ability to reason about the implications of belief in Greek gods and how such beliefs influence cultural and philosophical discussions.\n\n### Answer:\nThe belief in Greek gods is called \"Hellenic Polytheism\" or \"Hellenismos.\" This term encompasses both the ancient worship of the Olympian gods and modern revival movements that honor these deities through rituals and practices rooted in Greek tradition."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhat is it called when you believe in greek gods\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n[\"Like the gnostics, the Knights of Seth believe that there is a true God and a false one.
