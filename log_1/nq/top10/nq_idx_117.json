The Super Bowl 50 took place on February 7, 2016, at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. The halftime show is a highly anticipated segment of the Super Bowl, often featuring prominent artists who attract significant viewership.\n\nFrom the retrieved knowledge, I know that Coldplay was confirmed as the headlining act for the Super Bowl 50 halftime show. This information establishes Coldplay's primary role in the performance. Additionally, I recall that Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars were special guest performers, which indicates their involvement as secondary but significant contributors to the show.\n\nUnderstanding the relationships between the headliner and the special guests is crucial for causal reasoning. Coldplay's performance, along with the appearances of Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars, not only enhances the entertainment value of the halftime show but also contributes to its cultural significance. The event is often one of the most-watched performances in television history, which further emphasizes the importance of the artists involved.\n\nThe temporal context of the event (February 7, 2016) allows for connections to be made with other events in the music industry and the Super Bowl's history. Knowing the date helps in understanding the sequence of events leading up to the show, including promotional activities and audience anticipation.\n\nFurthermore, recognizing the roles of the performers helps in differentiating their contributions. Coldplay, as the headliner, likely had a more extensive set and a central focus, while Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars, as special guests, would have contributed specific performances that complemented Coldplay's act.\n\nIn summary, the combination of the headliner and special guests, along with the event's significance and context, enhances the model's ability to reason about relationships and infer the impact of such performances on cultural phenomena.\n\n### Answer:\nColdplay, with special guests Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars, performed at the halftime show of Super Bowl 2016."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwho is playing the halftime show at super bowl 2016\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['Super Bowl LII halftime show\\n', 'The Super Bowl LII Halftime Show (officially known as the Pepsi Super Bowl LII Halftime Show) took place on February 4, 2018 at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota, as part of Super Bowl LII.
