This is confirmed in multiple passages, particularly in the context of its operations in 1937.\n\n2. **Number of Passengers**:\n   - On the flight that ended in disaster on May 6, 1937, the Hindenburg was carrying **36 passengers** out of a possible **70**. Additionally, there were **61 crew members** on board, including trainees. This detail is significant as it provides context about the capacity and operational status of the airship during its final flight.\n\n3. **Historical Context**:\n   - The Hindenburg had previously completed numerous successful flights, including a record round trip between Frankfurt and Lakehurst.
