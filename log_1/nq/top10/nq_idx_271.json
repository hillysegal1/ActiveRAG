Washington, D.C. is bordered by Maryland to the north, east, and south, making it essential to identify the counties and neighborhoods that are in closest proximity to the capital.\n\n1. **Geographical Context**: \n   - The concept of the **Capital Beltway** is crucial here. Areas that lie \"Inside the Beltway\" are typically more urbanized and have a higher density of commuters to Washington, D.C. This beltway encircles the capital and includes parts of both Maryland and Virginia, indicating that the areas within this boundary are considered close to D.C.\n\n2. **Key Counties**:\n   - **Prince George's County**: This county is directly adjacent to the southeastern part of D.C. Neighborhoods such as **Hyattsville**, **College Park**, and **Greenbelt** are very close to the D.C. border, making them some of the closest areas in Maryland to the capital.\n   - **Montgomery County**: Located to the northwest of D.C., this county includes areas like **Silver Spring** and **Bethesda**, which are also very close to the city. Bethesda, in particular, is noted for its proximity to D.C., being just outside the capital.\n\n3. **Commuter Patterns**: \n   - The passage about the **Nanjemoy area** becoming popular among commuters highlights the broader commuting dynamics between Maryland and Washington, D.C. While Nanjemoy is not as close as the aforementioned areas, it reflects the trend of people moving to Maryland suburbs for better housing options while commuting to D.C. for work.\n\n4. **Cultural and Historical Context**: \n   - Understanding that Washington, D.C. was formed from land ceded by Maryland and Virginia provides historical context for the close relationship between these regions. This historical backdrop can clarify why certain areas in Maryland are closely associated with the capital.\n\n5. **Transportation Infrastructure**: \n   - The mention of major roads such as **Maryland Route 6**, **Maryland Route 210**, and **U.S. Route 301** is important for understanding accessibility. Areas with better transportation links are more attractive for commuters, further emphasizing the significance of Prince George's and Montgomery Counties.\n\n### Answer:\nPrince George's County and Montgomery County are the parts of Maryland that are close to Washington, D.C. Specifically, neighborhoods like Hyattsville, College Park, Greenbelt, Silver Spring, and Bethesda are very near the D.C. border, making them significant for commuters and residents alike.

Washington, D.C. is bordered by Maryland on three sides: southeast, northeast, and northwest. The closest areas in Maryland to D.C. are typically found in Prince George's County and Montgomery County.\n\n1. **Prince George's County**: This county is directly adjacent to the southeastern part of D.C. Neighborhoods such as Hyattsville, College Park, and Greenbelt are very close to the D.C. border. The proximity of these neighborhoods facilitates easy commuting to the capital, which is further supported by major roads like Maryland Route 210 and U.S. Route 301.\n\n2. **Montgomery County**: Located to the northwest of D.C., this county includes areas like Silver Spring and Bethesda, which are also very close to the city. Bethesda is specifically noted for being just outside the capital, making it a prime example of a Maryland area that is closely linked to Washington, D.C.\n\n3. **Commuting Patterns**: The Nanjemoy area, while farther away, is becoming increasingly popular with Washington-area commuters, indicating a broader trend of movement between Maryland and D.C. This trend is influenced by transportation infrastructure, which plays a crucial role in facilitating access to the capital.\n\n4. **Historical Context**: The land that comprises Washington, D.C. was originally part of Maryland, which adds a historical layer to the understanding of the relationship between the two. This historical connection can inform current socio-political dynamics and regional policies.\n\n5. **Integration of Concepts**: By integrating knowledge about urban planning, transportation, and historical geography, we can infer that areas in Prince George's and Montgomery Counties are not only geographically close but also economically and socially interconnected with Washington, D.C. This interconnectedness can lead to increased population density and urban sprawl in these counties as they continue to serve as commuter hubs for the capital.\n\n### Answer:\nPrince George's County and Montgomery County are the parts of Maryland that are close to Washington, D.C. Specifically, neighborhoods like Hyattsville, College Park, Greenbelt in Prince George's County, and Silver Spring and Bethesda in Montgomery County are very near to the capital, facilitating easy commuting and economic interaction."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nwhat part of maryland is close to washington dc\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The area is served by Maryland Route 6 and other two-lane state highways; the nearest major roads are Maryland Route 210 to the north and U.S. Route 301 to the east.
