These earlier systems laid the groundwork for more sophisticated public warning systems.\n\n3. **Commercial Applications**: \n   - The introduction of systems like ShakeAlarm in North America in 2009 marked a significant step in commercializing earthquake early warning systems. ShakeAlarm was the first application of such a system to protect critical infrastructure, indicating the growing recognition of the need for early warning systems beyond Japan.\n\n4. **Contemporary Systems**: \n   - Modern systems like ShakeAlert, developed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), represent ongoing advancements in earthquake early warning technology.

Japan's Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) system is often highlighted as one of the first operational systems that provided real-time alerts to the public, with practical use starting in 2006 and public deployment in 2007.\n\n2. **Comparative Systems**: While Japan's EEW system is significant, other systems have also contributed to the evolution of earthquake warning technology.
