Additionally, a study which analyzed data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) found that nearly 40% of 20-year-olds received food stamps at some point before they turned 65. This indicates that many Americans will dip below the poverty line sometime during adulthood, but will not necessarily remain there for the rest of their life. Furthermore, 44% of individuals who are given transfer benefits (other than Social Security) in one year do not receive them the next. Over 90% of Americans who receive transfers from the government stop receiving them within 10 years, indicating that the population living below the poverty threshold is in flux and does not remain constant.\\n', 'Lacking educational attainment as well as disabilities are among the main causes for the infrequent employment.

While only about 12% of households fall below the poverty threshold at one point in time, the percentage of those who fall below the poverty line at any one point throughout a year is much higher. Working class as well as working poor households may fall below the poverty line if an income earner becomes unemployed.

Individuals or families whose income falls below this threshold are classified as living in poverty. This definition is crucial as it sets the baseline for understanding economic hardship.\n\n2. **Absolute Poverty Line**: The absolute poverty line specifically refers to the level of income below which individuals or families cannot meet basic needs for healthy living, such as food, shelter, and clothing. This emphasizes the fundamental requirements for survival and well-being, distinguishing it from relative poverty, which considers income in relation to the broader society.\n\n3. **Variability by Location**: The poverty line can vary significantly based on geographic location, as different regions have different costs of living. For instance, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) sets a federal poverty line that is updated annually to reflect inflation and local economic conditions. This variability means that what constitutes poverty in one area may not be the same in another.\n\n4. **Factors Influencing the Poverty Line**: The calculation of the poverty line takes into account various factors, including family size, age, and the cost of basic necessities. For example, the poverty threshold for a single person is different from that for a family of four, reflecting the varying needs based on household composition.\n\n5. **Income Measurement**: To determine if someone is below the poverty line, their total income is assessed, which includes wages, benefits, and other income sources. If this total income is below the established threshold for their specific situation, they are considered to be living under the poverty line.\n\n6. **Dynamic Nature of Poverty**: Poverty is not a static condition; individuals and families can move above or below the poverty line due to changes in employment status or other life circumstances. Approximately 20% of households may fall below the poverty line at some point in a given year, and nearly 40% of individuals may experience poverty at least once during their adult life. This fluidity highlights the transient nature of poverty.\n\n7. **Material Hardship and Poverty Line Discrepancy**: Research indicates a discrepancy between the official poverty line and the actual cost of living. Many individuals earning between 100-200% of the poverty line still face material hardships, suggesting that the poverty line may not accurately reflect the economic realities faced by many households.\n\n8. **Demographic Variations in Poverty**: Certain demographics, such as children and the elderly, experience higher rates of poverty.

Additionally, the threshold is adjusted based on household size, meaning that a single person's poverty threshold will differ from that of a family of four.\n\n3. **Income Measurement**: To determine if an individual or family is below the poverty line, their total income is assessed. This includes all sources of income, such as wages, government benefits, and other financial resources. If the total income is below the established threshold for their specific household situation, they are considered to be living under the poverty line.\n\n4. **Dynamics of Poverty**: Poverty is a dynamic condition rather than a static state. Many individuals and families may experience fluctuations in their economic status over time. For example, while only about 12% of households may be below the poverty line at any given moment, approximately 20% may fall below it at some point during the year. Furthermore, nearly 40% of individuals between the ages of 25 and 60 will experience at least one year below the official poverty line during their lifetime.\n\n5. **Causes and Context**: Various factors contribute to individuals falling below the poverty line, including unemployment, lack of education, and disabilities. Employment status is particularly influential, as job loss or reduced hours can lead to a sudden drop in income. The passages indicate that many who receive government assistance do not remain in poverty for long, suggesting that poverty can often be a temporary condition.\n\n6. **Broader Implications**: The official poverty line may not accurately reflect the true cost of living for many individuals and families. Studies have shown that a significant number of people earning just above the poverty line still face material hardships, indicating that the poverty line may underestimate the economic challenges faced by many Americans.\n\n### Final Answer:\nYou are considered under the poverty line when your total income falls below the established threshold set by the government or relevant authority for your specific family size and location. This threshold is designed to reflect the minimum income necessary to meet basic living standards, and it varies based on household composition and regional cost of living. Poverty is a dynamic condition, with many individuals experiencing fluctuations in their economic status over time, influenced by factors such as employment and education. Understanding the poverty line requires recognizing its definition, the specific income thresholds, and the broader socio-economic context in which poverty exists."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nwhen are you considered under the poverty line\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['Living above or below the poverty threshold is not necessarily a position in which an individual remains static.

Additionally, a study which analyzed data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) found that nearly 40% of 20-year-olds received food stamps at some point before they turned 65. This indicates that many Americans will dip below the poverty line sometime during adulthood, but will not necessarily remain there for the rest of their life. Furthermore, 44% of individuals who are given transfer benefits (other than Social Security) in one year do not receive them the next.

Working class as well as working poor households may fall below the poverty line if an income earner becomes unemployed.

For example, in 2015, the threshold for a single person under 65 was $11,770, while for a family of four, it was $24,250. This variability reflects the need to adjust for different family sizes and living costs in various regions.\n\n3. **Dynamic Nature of Poverty**: Poverty status is fluid, with many individuals experiencing fluctuations in their economic status throughout their lives. For instance, about 40% of 20-year-olds receive food stamps at some point before age 65, and approximately 20% of households fall below the poverty line at some point in a given year. This indicates that poverty is not merely a static condition but rather a dynamic state influenced by various life circumstances.\n\n4. **Impact of Employment**: Employment status is a critical factor in determining whether households fall below the poverty line. Unemployment can lead to a household's descent into poverty, and many households may rise above or fall below the threshold depending on the employment situation of their members. This highlights the causal relationship between job stability and poverty status.\n\n5. **Demographic Variations**: Poverty rates vary significantly by age group, with higher percentages of individuals under 18 and those aged 65 and older living below the poverty line. This demographic insight allows for a more nuanced understanding of poverty and its impact on different segments of the population.\n\n6. **Material Hardship**: Many individuals earning between 100-200% of the poverty line report experiencing material hardships, suggesting that the poverty line may not accurately reflect the actual cost of living and basic needs.

The 'absolute poverty line' specifically refers to the level below which individuals or families lack the resources to meet basic needs for healthy living, such as food, shelter, and clothing.\n\n2. **Dynamic Nature of Poverty**: It is important to recognize that living above or below the poverty threshold is not static. Many individuals can move in and out of poverty throughout their lives. For instance, studies indicate that nearly 40% of Americans between the ages of 25 and 60 will experience at least one year below the official poverty line during that period.\n\n3. **Variability by Location**: The poverty line can vary significantly depending on the country, region, and even local jurisdictions. For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) sets a federal poverty line that is updated annually based on the cost of living and inflation.\n\n4. **Factors Influencing the Poverty Line**: The poverty line is calculated based on various factors, including family size, age, and the cost of basic necessities such as food, housing, and healthcare. Poverty thresholds depend on the number of people living in the household, which is crucial for understanding individual circumstances.\n\n5. **Income Measurement**: To determine if someone is below the poverty line, their total income is assessed. This includes wages, benefits, and any other sources of income. If this total is below the established poverty threshold for their specific situation (e.g., family size), they are considered under the poverty line.\n\n6. **Material Hardships and Poverty Line**: Many experts agree that the official poverty line in the United States is substantially lower than the actual cost of basic needs. This discrepancy suggests that the poverty line may not accurately reflect the financial realities faced by many individuals and families, as a significant portion of those earning just above the poverty line may still experience material hardships.\n\n7. **Use of Poverty Line**: The poverty line is used for various purposes, including eligibility for government assistance programs, social services, and research on economic conditions. It is also important to note that while the poverty threshold is used by federal organizations, government aid programs may not necessarily use this threshold as a standard for determining eligibility.\n\n**Answer**: \nYou are considered under the poverty line when your total income falls below the established threshold set by the government or relevant authority for your specific family size and location. This indicates that you do not have enough resources to meet basic living standards, which include essential needs such as food, shelter, and clothing. Additionally, it is important to recognize that many individuals experience fluctuations in their poverty status throughout their lives, and the poverty line can vary based on factors such as household size and local cost of living."}], "question_info": {"question": "when are you considered under the poverty line", "passages": ["Living above or below the poverty threshold is not necessarily a position in which an individual remains static. As many as one in three impoverished people were not poor at birth; rather, they descended into poverty over the course of their life. Additionally, a study which analyzed data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) found that nearly 40% of 20-year-olds received food stamps at some point before they turned 65. This indicates that many Americans will dip below the poverty line sometime during adulthood, but will not necessarily remain there for the rest of their life. Furthermore, 44% of individuals who are given transfer benefits (other than Social Security) in one year do not receive them the next. Over 90% of Americans who receive transfers from the government stop receiving them within 10 years, indicating that the population living below the poverty threshold is in flux and does not remain constant.\n", "Lacking educational attainment as well as disabilities are among the main causes for the infrequent employment. Many households rise above or fall below the poverty threshold, depending on the employment status of household members. While only about 12% of households fall below the poverty threshold at one point in time, the percentage of those who fall below the poverty line at any one point throughout a year is much higher. Working class as well as working poor households may fall below the poverty line if an income earner becomes unemployed. In any given year roughly one out of every five (20%) households falls below the poverty line at some point while up to 40% may fall into poverty within the course of a decade.\n", "The 'absolute poverty line' is the threshold below which families or individuals are considered to be lacking the resources to meet the basic needs for healthy living; having insufficient income to provide the food, shelter and clothing needed to preserve health. Poverty among Americans between ages 18\u201364 has fallen only marginally since 1966, from 10.5% then to 10.1% today. Poverty has significantly fallen among Americans under 18 years old from 23% in 1964 down to less than 17%, although it has risen again to 20% in 2009. The most dramatic decrease in poverty was among Americans over 65, which fell from 28.5% in 1966 to 10.1% today.\n", "those 65 and older are living below the poverty line.\n", "If a family's total income before taxes is below the poverty threshold, that family is in poverty, and all members of that family have the same poverty status. The same applies for a single individual. The poverty threshold is used by federal organizations, including the United States Census Bureau, but government aid programs do not have to use the threshold as a standard to determine eligibility.\n", "Most experts and the public agree that the official poverty line in the United States is substantially lower than the actual cost of basic needs. In particular, a 2017 Urban Institute study found that 61% of non-elderly adults earning between 100-200% of the poverty line reported at least one material hardship, not significantly different from those below the poverty line. The cause of the discrepancy is believed to be an outdated model of spending patterns based on actual spending in the year 1955; the number and proportion of material needs has risen substantially since then. However, the Donald Trump administration is publicly floating a policy that would lower the line even further (in some areas) by switching to a consumer price index that is more accurate for low incomes, which would strengthen assistance programs by reducing the number of eligible individuals and make the line itself an even more accurate indicator of poverty.\n", "15.7% of families and 23.5% of the population had income below the poverty line during the 12 months prior to being surveyed. People with incomes below the poverty line include 32.1% of those under age 18 and 8.9% of those age 65 or over.\n", "In United States, the poverty thresholds are updated every year by Census Bureau. The threshold in United States are updated and used for statistical purposes. In 2015, in the United States, the poverty threshold for a single person under 65 was an annual income of US$11,770; the threshold for a family group of four, including two children, was US$24,250. According to the U.S. Census Bureau data released on 13 September 2011, the nation's poverty rate rose to 15.1 percent in 2010.\n", "The poverty threshold in the U.S. is updated each year by the U.S. Census Bureau. The number is adjusted according to inflation to reflect the updated cost of living in particular areas. In 2016 12.7% of Americans were living below the poverty threshold. Poverty thresholds depend on the number of people living in the household.\n", "By 2013, \"nearly 40 percent of Americans between the ages of 25 and 60 will experience at least one year below the official poverty line during that period ($23,492 for a family of four), and 54 percent will spend a year in poverty or near poverty (below 150 percent of the poverty line).\" By 2015, Rank and Hirschl reported that \"24.9 percent of the [U.S.] population will encounter five or more years of poverty, and 11.4 percent will experience five or more years of extreme poverty\".\n"], "__answers__": ["US $11,770"]}}
