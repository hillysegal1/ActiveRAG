This understanding can be applied to other contexts where a change in quantity or structure occurs, allowing for better predictions and reasoning about potential causes (e.g., production constraints).\n\n2. **Contextual Reasoning**: The mention of production schedules and logistical challenges provides a causal framework for understanding why the number of episodes was reduced.
