This can repeat such that every water molecule is H-bonded with up to four other molecules, as shown in the figure (two through its two lone pairs, and two through its two hydrogen atoms).

This interaction is crucial in determining the physical and chemical properties of many substances, influencing behaviors such as boiling points, solubility, and structural integrity.\n\n2. **Identifying Common Substances**: Beyond water (H\u2082O), which is the most recognized molecule exhibiting hydrogen bonding, we can identify other molecules that contain hydrogen atoms bonded to electronegative atoms. These substances can also engage in hydrogen bonding, albeit often to a lesser extent than water.\n\n3. **Examples of Molecules with Hydrogen Bonds**:\n   - **Ammonia (NH\u2083)**: Ammonia contains hydrogen atoms bonded to nitrogen, which is sufficiently electronegative to form hydrogen bonds with other ammonia molecules or with water. This property contributes to ammonia's relatively high boiling point compared to similar-sized molecules.\n   - **Hydrofluoric Acid (HF)**: HF is notable for its strong hydrogen bonding due to the high electronegativity of fluorine. This bonding significantly affects its properties, making it a weak acid compared to other hydrogen halides.\n   - **Alcohols (e.g., Ethanol, C\u2082H\u2085OH)**: Alcohols possess a hydroxyl (-OH) group that allows them to form hydrogen bonds with other alcohol molecules or with water, enhancing their solubility and boiling points.\n   - **Carboxylic Acids (e.g., Acetic Acid, CH\u2083COOH)**: These compounds can form hydrogen bonds due to the presence of both hydroxyl (-OH) and carbonyl (C=O) groups, which allows for extensive intermolecular interactions.\n   - **Nucleic Acids (e.g., DNA)**: The structure of DNA is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between nitrogenous bases, which are crucial for the integrity of genetic information.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the properties and examples of hydrogen bonding, we can identify several substances other than water that exhibit this type of bonding.\n\n### Answer:\nAmmonia (NH\u2083), Hydrofluoric Acid (HF), Alcohols (e.g., Ethanol), Carboxylic Acids (e.g., Acetic Acid), and Nucleic Acids (e.g., DNA). \n\n### Final Thoughts:\nThis comprehensive understanding of hydrogen bonding not only highlights specific substances but also emphasizes the broader implications of these interactions in both chemical and biological contexts. The ability of various molecules to form hydrogen bonds plays a critical role in their behavior and interactions, influencing everything from solubility to structural stability in biological macromolecules."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nother than water what else has hydrogen bonds\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['A single water molecule can participate in a maximum of four hydrogen bonds because it can accept two bonds using the lone pairs on oxygen and donate two hydrogen atoms. Other molecules like hydrogen fluoride, ammonia and methanol can also form hydrogen bonds. However, they do not show anomalous thermodynamic, kinetic or structural properties like those observed in water because none of them can form four hydrogen bonds: either they cannot donate or accept hydrogen atoms, or there are steric effects in bulky residues. In water, intermolecular tetrahedral structures form due to the four hydrogen bonds, thereby forming an open structure and a three-dimensional bonding network, resulting in the anomalous decrease in density when cooled below 4\\xa0\u00b0C. This repeated, constantly reorganizing unit defines a three-dimensional network extending throughout the liquid. This view is based upon neutron scattering studies and computer simulations, and it makes sense in the light of the unambiguously tetrahedral arrangement of water molecules in ice structures.\\n', 'Hydrogen bond\\n', 'A ubiquitous example of a hydrogen bond is found between water molecules. In a discrete water molecule, there are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Two molecules of water can form a hydrogen bond between them that is to say oxygen-hydrogen bonding; the simplest case, when only two molecules are present, is called the water dimer and is often used as a model system. When more molecules are present, as is the case with liquid water, more bonds are possible because the oxygen of one water molecule has two lone pairs of electrons, each of which can form a hydrogen bond with a hydrogen on another water molecule. This can repeat such that every water molecule is H-bonded with up to four other molecules, as shown in the figure (two through its two lone pairs, and two through its two hydrogen atoms). Hydrogen bonding strongly affects the crystal structure of ice, helping to create an open hexagonal lattice. The density of ice is less than the density of water at the same temperature; thus, the solid phase of water floats on the liquid, unlike most other substances.\\n', 'Hydrogen is noted for the different ways it forms bonds. It most commonly forms covalent bonds. It can lose its single valence electron in aqueous solution, leaving behind a bare proton with tremendous polarising power. This subsequently attaches itself to the lone electron pair of an oxygen atom in a water molecule, thereby forming the basis of acid-base chemistry. Under certain conditions a hydrogen atom in a molecule can form a second, weaker, bond with an atom or group of atoms in another molecule. Such bonding, \"helps give snowflakes their hexagonal symmetry, binds DNA into a double helix; shapes the three-dimensional forms of proteins; and even raises water\u2019s boiling point high enough to make a decent cup of tea.\"\\n', 'A molecular hydride may be able to bind to hydrogen molecules acting as a ligand. The complexes are termed non-classical covalent hydrides. These complexes contain more hydrogen than the classical covalent hydrides, but are only stable at very low temperatures. They may be isolated in inert gas matrix, or as a cryogenic gas. Others have only been predicted using computational chemistry.\\n', 'All halogens form binary compounds with hydrogen known as the hydrogen halides: hydrogen fluoride (HF), hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen bromide (HBr), hydrogen iodide (HI), and hydrogen astatide (HAt). All of these compounds form acids when mixed with water. Hydrogen fluoride is the only hydrogen halide that forms hydrogen bonds. Hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, and hydroastatic acid are all strong acids, but hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid.\\n', 'Hydrogen has only one valence electron, but it can form bonds with more than one atom. In the bifluoride ion (), for example, it forms a three-center four-electron bond with two fluoride atoms: \\n', 'Water () is an oxide of hydrogen and the most familiar oxygen compound. Hydrogen atoms are covalently bonded to oxygen in a water molecule but also have an additional attraction (about 23.3\\xa0kJ/mol per hydrogen atom) to an adjacent oxygen atom in a separate molecule. These hydrogen bonds between water molecules hold them approximately 15% closer than what would be expected in a simple liquid with just van der Waals forces.\\n', \"A hydrogen bond (H-bond), is a specific type of interaction that involves dipole-dipole attraction between a partially positive hydrogen atom and a highly electronegative, partially negative oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, or fluorine atom (not covalently bound to said hydrogen atom). It is not a covalent bond, but instead is classified as a strong non-covalent interaction. It is responsible for why water is a liquid at room temperature and not a gas (given water's low molecular weight). Most commonly, the strength of hydrogen bonds lies between 0 - 4 kcal/mol, but can sometimes be as strong as 40 kcal/mol In solvents such as chloroform or carbontetrachloride one observes e.g. for the interaction between amides additive values of about 5 kJ/mol. According to L. Pauling the strength of a hydrogen bond is essentially determined by the electrostatic charges. Measurements of thousands complexes in chloroform or carbontetrachloride have led to additive free energy increments for all kind of donor-acceptor combinations.\\n\", 'Hydrogen and chlorine were originally used as examples of univalent atoms, because of their nature to form only one single bond.

This type of bonding is crucial in determining the properties of many substances, including their boiling points, solubility, and structural integrity.\n\n2. **Identifying Common Substances**: Besides water (H\u2082O), which is the most well-known molecule exhibiting hydrogen bonding, there are several other molecules that contain hydrogen atoms bonded to electronegative atoms.\n\n3. **Examples of Molecules with Hydrogen Bonds**:\n   - **Ammonia (NH\u2083)**: In ammonia, the hydrogen atoms are bonded to nitrogen, which is electronegative enough to form hydrogen bonds with other ammonia molecules or with water.\n   - **Hydrofluoric Acid (HF)**: HF has strong hydrogen bonding due to the high electronegativity of fluorine. It is important to note that while HF can form hydrogen bonds, it does not exhibit the same anomalous properties as water.\n   - **Methanol (CH\u2083OH)**: Methanol can form hydrogen bonds due to its hydroxyl (-OH) group, allowing it to interact with other methanol molecules or with water.\n   - **Alcohols (e.g., Ethanol, C\u2082H\u2085OH)**: Alcohols contain hydroxyl groups that enable them to form hydrogen bonds with other alcohol molecules or with water.\n   - **Carboxylic Acids (e.g., Acetic Acid, CH\u2083COOH)**: These compounds can form hydrogen bonds due to the presence of both hydroxyl (-OH) and carbonyl (C=O) groups.\n   - **Nucleic Acids (e.g., DNA)**: The base pairs in DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds between nitrogenous bases, which is critical for the stability of the genetic material.\n\n4. **Hydrogen Bonding Characteristics**: While HF, NH\u2083, and methanol can form hydrogen bonds, they do not exhibit the same anomalous thermodynamic, kinetic, or structural properties as water. This distinction is crucial for understanding the unique role of water in biological and chemical systems.\n\n5. **Role of Hydrogen Bonds in Biological Structures**: Hydrogen bonds play a significant role in biological structures, such as stabilizing the double helix of DNA and influencing the three-dimensional forms of proteins. This highlights the importance of hydrogen bonding in biological processes.\n\n6. **Hydrogen Halides**: All halogens form binary compounds with hydrogen known as hydrogen halides (e.g., HF, HCl, HBr, HI). However, only hydrogen fluoride is noted to form hydrogen bonds, which clarifies the conditions under which hydrogen bonding occurs in these compounds.\n\n7. **Strength of Hydrogen Bonds**: The strength of hydrogen bonds can vary, typically ranging from 0 - 4 kcal/mol, and sometimes reaching as strong as 40 kcal/mol. Understanding this variability can refine the model's knowledge of hydrogen bonding across different molecules.\n\n8. **Hydrogen Bonding in Ice**: Hydrogen bonding significantly affects the crystal structure of ice, creating an open hexagonal lattice. This detail is crucial for understanding the physical properties of ice compared to liquid water, such as why ice floats on water.\n\nBy incorporating these points, the model can enhance its understanding of hydrogen bonding, recognize the diversity of molecules that participate in such interactions, and appreciate the biological significance of these bonds. This would help mitigate any overconfidence in the model's existing knowledge and reduce the likelihood of model illusions.\n\n### Answer:\nOther than water, substances that exhibit hydrogen bonding include ammonia (NH\u2083), hydrofluoric acid (HF), methanol (CH\u2083OH), alcohols (e.g., ethanol, C\u2082H\u2085OH), carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic acid, CH\u2083COOH), and nucleic acids (e.g., DNA)."}], "question_info": {"question": "other than water what else has hydrogen bonds", "passages": ["A single water molecule can participate in a maximum of four hydrogen bonds because it can accept two bonds using the lone pairs on oxygen and donate two hydrogen atoms. Other molecules like hydrogen fluoride, ammonia and methanol can also form hydrogen bonds. However, they do not show anomalous thermodynamic, kinetic or structural properties like those observed in water because none of them can form four hydrogen bonds: either they cannot donate or accept hydrogen atoms, or there are steric effects in bulky residues. In water, intermolecular tetrahedral structures form due to the four hydrogen bonds, thereby forming an open structure and a three-dimensional bonding network, resulting in the anomalous decrease in density when cooled below 4\u00a0\u00b0C. This repeated, constantly reorganizing unit defines a three-dimensional network extending throughout the liquid. This view is based upon neutron scattering studies and computer simulations, and it makes sense in the light of the unambiguously tetrahedral arrangement of water molecules in ice structures.\n", "Hydrogen bond\n", "A ubiquitous example of a hydrogen bond is found between water molecules. In a discrete water molecule, there are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Two molecules of water can form a hydrogen bond between them that is to say oxygen-hydrogen bonding; the simplest case, when only two molecules are present, is called the water dimer and is often used as a model system. When more molecules are present, as is the case with liquid water, more bonds are possible because the oxygen of one water molecule has two lone pairs of electrons, each of which can form a hydrogen bond with a hydrogen on another water molecule. This can repeat such that every water molecule is H-bonded with up to four other molecules, as shown in the figure (two through its two lone pairs, and two through its two hydrogen atoms). Hydrogen bonding strongly affects the crystal structure of ice, helping to create an open hexagonal lattice. The density of ice is less than the density of water at the same temperature; thus, the solid phase of water floats on the liquid, unlike most other substances.\n", "Hydrogen is noted for the different ways it forms bonds. It most commonly forms covalent bonds. It can lose its single valence electron in aqueous solution, leaving behind a bare proton with tremendous polarising power. This subsequently attaches itself to the lone electron pair of an oxygen atom in a water molecule, thereby forming the basis of acid-base chemistry. Under certain conditions a hydrogen atom in a molecule can form a second, weaker, bond with an atom or group of atoms in another molecule. Such bonding, \"helps give snowflakes their hexagonal symmetry, binds DNA into a double helix; shapes the three-dimensional forms of proteins; and even raises water\u2019s boiling point high enough to make a decent cup of tea.\"\n", "A molecular hydride may be able to bind to hydrogen molecules acting as a ligand. The complexes are termed non-classical covalent hydrides. These complexes contain more hydrogen than the classical covalent hydrides, but are only stable at very low temperatures. They may be isolated in inert gas matrix, or as a cryogenic gas. Others have only been predicted using computational chemistry.\n", "All halogens form binary compounds with hydrogen known as the hydrogen halides: hydrogen fluoride (HF), hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen bromide (HBr), hydrogen iodide (HI), and hydrogen astatide (HAt). All of these compounds form acids when mixed with water. Hydrogen fluoride is the only hydrogen halide that forms hydrogen bonds. Hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, and hydroastatic acid are all strong acids, but hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid.\n", "Hydrogen has only one valence electron, but it can form bonds with more than one atom. In the bifluoride ion (), for example, it forms a three-center four-electron bond with two fluoride atoms: \n", "Water () is an oxide of hydrogen and the most familiar oxygen compound. Hydrogen atoms are covalently bonded to oxygen in a water molecule but also have an additional attraction (about 23.3\u00a0kJ/mol per hydrogen atom) to an adjacent oxygen atom in a separate molecule. These hydrogen bonds between water molecules hold them approximately 15% closer than what would be expected in a simple liquid with just van der Waals forces.\n", "A hydrogen bond (H-bond), is a specific type of interaction that involves dipole-dipole attraction between a partially positive hydrogen atom and a highly electronegative, partially negative oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, or fluorine atom (not covalently bound to said hydrogen atom). It is not a covalent bond, but instead is classified as a strong non-covalent interaction. It is responsible for why water is a liquid at room temperature and not a gas (given water's low molecular weight). Most commonly, the strength of hydrogen bonds lies between 0 - 4 kcal/mol, but can sometimes be as strong as 40 kcal/mol In solvents such as chloroform or carbontetrachloride one observes e.g. for the interaction between amides additive values of about 5 kJ/mol. According to L. Pauling the strength of a hydrogen bond is essentially determined by the electrostatic charges. Measurements of thousands complexes in chloroform or carbontetrachloride have led to additive free energy increments for all kind of donor-acceptor combinations.\n", "Hydrogen and chlorine were originally used as examples of univalent atoms, because of their nature to form only one single bond. Hydrogen has only one \"valence electron\" and can form only one bond with an atom that has an incomplete outer shell. Chlorine has seven \"valence electrons\" and can form only one bond with an atom that donates a \"valence electron\" to complete chlorine's outer shell. However, chlorine can also have oxidation states from +1 to +7 and can form more than one bond by donating \"valence electrons\".\n"], "__answers__": ["inorganic molecules such as water", "organic molecules like DNA and proteins"]}}
