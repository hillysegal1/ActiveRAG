In response, the U.S. government, under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, began to suspend the gold standard in 1933. This included measures to prevent gold hoarding and mandated citizens to exchange their gold for U.S. dollars, effectively removing the gold backing for domestic currency.\n\n4. **April 19, 1933**: This date is significant as it marks the official abandonment of the gold standard for domestic transactions.

In response, the government sought to increase the money supply and stimulate the economy, necessitating a departure from the rigidities of the gold standard.\n\n4. **Domestic Abandonment**: On April 19, 1933, the U.S. government, under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, effectively suspended the gold standard for domestic transactions. This involved a series of executive orders and laws that required citizens to exchange their gold holdings for U.S. dollars, thus preventing gold hoarding and allowing for a more flexible monetary policy.\n\n5. **Gold Reserve Act of 1934**: This act further solidified the abandonment of the gold standard by making gold clauses unenforceable and revaluing gold from $20.67 to $35 per ounce, which devalued the dollar. This price remained until the next significant change in 1971.\n\n6. **International Context and Nixon Shock**: While the U.S. dollar was no longer convertible to gold for domestic transactions after 1933, it remained pegged to gold for international transactions until August 15, 1971. On this date, President Nixon announced the suspension of the dollar's convertibility into gold, a move known as the \"Nixon Shock,\" which marked the complete transition to a fiat currency system.\n\n7. **Causal Relationships**: The reasoning process highlights the causal relationship between economic conditions (e.g., the Great Depression) and the policy decisions made by the government (e.g., abandoning the gold standard). It also emphasizes how these decisions were influenced by the need for monetary flexibility to address economic crises.\n\n8. **Temporal Sequencing and Policy Implications**: The timeline of events\u2014from the domestic abandonment in 1933, the Gold Reserve Act in 1934, to the Nixon Shock in 1971\u2014illustrates how earlier decisions set the stage for later developments.

This understanding enhances the model's ability to reason through multifaceted scenarios and make informed predictions.\n\n### Answer:\nThe U.S. dollar left the gold standard domestically on April 19, 1933, when the government suspended the gold standard for domestic transactions.
