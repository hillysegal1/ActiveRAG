In 1939, the inaugural year of the NCAA tournament, the NIT was generally considered to be superior. During the 1940s, the relative status of the two tournaments was unclear, and thus some years produced disputed national championship claims. Some contemporary sources claim superiority for the NIT during this time. In 1943, in a shrewd competitive move the NCAA tournament began sharing Madison Square Garden with the NIT. In 1945, following victories by the NCAA champions over the NIT champions in the Red Cross games, \"The New York Times\" indicated that many teams who could potentially get bids to enter either tournament would probably choose the NCAA tournament \"because it involves stronger competition.\" In 1950, City College of New York won both the NIT and the NCAA tournaments in the same season, coincidentally defeating Bradley University in the championship game of both tournaments, and thus united the titles.\\n', \"In 1939, another national tournament was implemented by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The location of the NCAA Tournament varied from year to year, and it soon used multiple locations each year, so more fans could see games without traveling to New York. Although the NIT was created earlier and was more prestigious than the NCAA for many years, it ultimately lost popularity and status to the NCAA Tournament. In 1950, following a double win by the 1949\u201350 CCNY Beavers men's basketball team (when the NIT comprised 12 and the NCAA 8 teams), the NCAA ruled that no team could compete in both tournaments, and effectively indicated that a team eligible for the NCAA tournament should play in it. Not long afterward, assisted by the 1951 scandals based in New York City, the NCAA tournament had become more prestigious than before, with conference champions and the majority of top-ranked teams competing there. The NCAA tournament eventually overtook the NIT by 1960. Through the 1960s and 1970s, with UCLA leading the way as winner of ten NCAA Tournament championships, a shift in power to teams from the west amplified the shift of attention away from the New York City-based NIT. When the NCAA tournament expanded its field of teams from 25 to 32 in 1975, to 48 in 1980, to 64 in 1985, and to 68 teams in 2011, interest in the NCAA tournament increased again and again, as it comprised more and more teams, soon including all of the strongest ones. (Expansion also improved the distribution of playing locations, which number roughly one-third the number of teams in the field.)\\n\", 'BULLET::::- During 1939, Long Island University finished the regular season unbeaten but decided to accept instead an invitation to the second NIT (which they won) instead of the first and only NABC tournament (later called the NCAA tournament), as the NIT was more prestigious at the time. It wasn\\'t until the mid-1950s that the NCAA required that its tournament would have \"first choice\" in determining teams for their field. Before then, many of the more successful teams during the regular season chose to play in the NIT instead of the NCAA tournament.\\n', 'After the fall-out from the 1951 gambling and point-shaving scandals, the NCAA tournament pulled out of Madison Square Garden. With conference champions and the majority of the top-ranked teams participating in it, the NCAA tournament since then came to be regarded as the more important post-season tourney and the sole determiner of the national championship, although following the taint of the gambling scandals, the NIT was still considered a quality tournament for some time afterward. The NCAA built on the momentum of three consecutive Red Cross \"mythical national championship\" game victories over the NIT, eventually outmaneuvering the NIT by adeptly avoiding permanent damage from the 1951 gambling and point-shaving scandals and by adding more teams. As the NCAA Tournament steadily gained preeminence and became the sole source of naming the national champion, winners of the NCAA Tournament during those early years were given the same level of honor.\\n', 'The National Commissioners Invitational Tournament was an eight-team postseason college men\\'s basketball tournament run by the NCAA. It was introduced in 1974 as the Collegiate Commissioners Association Tournament. It was created because the NCAA wanted to \"kill\" the NIT, which, at that time, it did not control. It only lasted two years before being discontinued after changes to the NCAA Tournament which allowed more than one team per conference to participate.\\n', \"The inaugural National Invitation Tournament (NIT) was held in 1938. The following season, a second postseason college basketball tournament was founded: the NCAA Tournament, which was originally organized by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), although the NCAA did consider the event its basketball championship. The concept of the tournament was pitched to the association by Ohio State coach Harold Olsen. In October 1938, the NCAA announced that it approved the tournament's creation, as long as it was run by the NABC. The tournament featured an eight-team field, consisting of conference champions. The teams were divided into East and West regions.\\n\", 'As the NCAA tournament expanded its field to include more teams, the reputation of the NIT suffered. In 1973, NBC moved televised coverage of the NCAA championship from Saturday afternoon to Monday evening, providing the NCAA Tournament with prime-time television exposure the NIT could not match. Even more crucially, when the NCAA eliminated the one-team-per-conference rule in 1975, its requirement that teams accept its bids relegated the NIT to a collection of teams that did not make the NCAA grade.\\n', \"In 2005, the NCAA purchased 10-year rights to the NIT from the MIBA for $56.5 million to settle an antitrust lawsuit, which had gone to trial and was being argued until very shortly before the settlement was announced. The MIBA alleged that compelling teams to accept invitations to the NCAA tournament even if they preferred to play in the NIT was an illegal use of the NCAA's powers. In addition, it argued that the NCAA's expansion of its tournament to 65 teams (68 since 2011) was designed specifically to bankrupt the NIT. Faced with the very real possibility of being found in violation of federal antitrust law for the third time in its history, the NCAA chose to settle. (The first two violations were related to restrictions on televising college football and capping assistant coach salaries.) As part of the purchase of the NIT by the NCAA, the MIBA disbanded.\\n\", \"The first men's national championship tournament, the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball tournament, which still exists as the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) tournament, was organized in 1937. The first national championship for NCAA teams, the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in New York, was organized in 1938; the NCAA national tournament would begin one year later.

By 1950, the NCAA ruled that no team could compete in both tournaments, effectively steering top teams towards the NCAA tournament.\n\n3. **Key Events and Changes**: The NCAA tournament's prestige grew significantly after the 1951 scandals, as it began to attract the majority of top-ranked teams and conference champions. The NCAA's strategic decisions, such as expanding the tournament field and moving its championship game to prime-time television in 1973, further enhanced its visibility and importance compared to the NIT.\n\n4. **Final Confirmation of Dominance**: By 1960, the NCAA tournament had overtaken the NIT in terms of prestige.

The expansion of the NCAA tournament in subsequent decades only solidified this status, as it included more teams and became the focal point of college basketball.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The NCAA tournament became more important than the NIT primarily in the mid-1950s, with a definitive shift occurring by 1960. Factors contributing to this shift included the NCAA's strategic decisions, the fallout from gambling scandals affecting the NIT, and the NCAA's ability to attract top teams and increase its visibility through television and tournament expansion.\n\nIn summary, the NCAA tournament's rise to prominence over the NIT was a gradual process influenced by competitive dynamics, strategic decisions, and external events like scandals.

Initially, the NIT, established in 1938, was regarded as the premier postseason event in college basketball, attracting top teams and players. The NCAA tournament followed in 1939 but struggled to gain the same level of recognition in its early years.\n\n1. **Initial Prestige**: In the early years, particularly during the 1940s, the NIT was often viewed as the superior tournament. For example, in 1943, the NCAA tournament shared Madison Square Garden with the NIT, highlighting the latter's prominence at that time. The competition between the two tournaments led to some ambiguity regarding national championships, as teams sometimes claimed titles from both tournaments.\n\n2. **Turning Point in the 1950s**: The mid-1950s marked a significant turning point. The NCAA tournament began to gain traction, particularly after the 1951 gambling scandals that damaged the NIT's reputation. The NCAA's decision to prohibit teams from participating in both tournaments further solidified its dominance, effectively steering top teams toward the NCAA tournament. By 1950, the NCAA's ruling indicated a shift in preference among teams.\n\n3. **Growing Prestige of the NCAA Tournament**: Following the scandals, the NCAA tournament attracted more top-ranked teams and conference champions. Strategic decisions, such as expanding the tournament field and moving its championship game to prime-time television in 1973, significantly enhanced the NCAA tournament's visibility and importance compared to the NIT.\n\n4. **Establishment of Dominance**: By 1960, the NCAA tournament had overtaken the NIT in terms of prestige. Although the NIT remained a respected tournament, it was increasingly viewed as a secondary event for teams that did not qualify for the NCAA tournament. The NCAA tournament's expansion in subsequent decades further solidified its status as the focal point of college basketball.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The NCAA tournament became more important than the NIT primarily in the mid-1950s, with a definitive shift occurring by 1960. Factors contributing to this shift included the NCAA's strategic decisions, the fallout from gambling scandals affecting the NIT, and the NCAA's ability to attract top teams and increase its visibility through television and tournament expansion.\n\nIn summary, the NCAA tournament's rise to prominence over the NIT was a gradual process influenced by competitive dynamics, strategic decisions, and external events like scandals.

In 1939, the inaugural year of the NCAA tournament, the NIT was generally considered to be superior. During the 1940s, the relative status of the two tournaments was unclear, and thus some years produced disputed national championship claims. Some contemporary sources claim superiority for the NIT during this time. In 1943, in a shrewd competitive move the NCAA tournament began sharing Madison Square Garden with the NIT. In 1945, following victories by the NCAA champions over the NIT champions in the Red Cross games, \"The New York Times\" indicated that many teams who could potentially get bids to enter either tournament would probably choose the NCAA tournament \"because it involves stronger competition.\" In 1950, City College of New York won both the NIT and the NCAA tournaments in the same season, coincidentally defeating Bradley University in the championship game of both tournaments, and thus united the titles.\\n', \"In 1939, another national tournament was implemented by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The location of the NCAA Tournament varied from year to year, and it soon used multiple locations each year, so more fans could see games without traveling to New York. Although the NIT was created earlier and was more prestigious than the NCAA for many years, it ultimately lost popularity and status to the NCAA Tournament. In 1950, following a double win by the 1949\u201350 CCNY Beavers men's basketball team (when the NIT comprised 12 and the NCAA 8 teams), the NCAA ruled that no team could compete in both tournaments, and effectively indicated that a team eligible for the NCAA tournament should play in it. Not long afterward, assisted by the 1951 scandals based in New York City, the NCAA tournament had become more prestigious than before, with conference champions and the majority of top-ranked teams competing there. The NCAA tournament eventually overtook the NIT by 1960. Through the 1960s and 1970s, with UCLA leading the way as winner of ten NCAA Tournament championships, a shift in power to teams from the west amplified the shift of attention away from the New York City-based NIT. When the NCAA tournament expanded its field of teams from 25 to 32 in 1975, to 48 in 1980, to 64 in 1985, and to 68 teams in 2011, interest in the NCAA tournament increased again and again, as it comprised more and more teams, soon including all of the strongest ones.

The NCAA built on the momentum of three consecutive Red Cross \"mythical national championship\" game victories over the NIT, eventually outmaneuvering the NIT by adeptly avoiding permanent damage from the 1951 gambling and point-shaving scandals and by adding more teams.

In 1939, the inaugural year of the NCAA tournament, the NIT was generally considered to be superior. During the 1940s, the relative status of the two tournaments was unclear, and thus some years produced disputed national championship claims. Some contemporary sources claim superiority for the NIT during this time. In 1943, in a shrewd competitive move the NCAA tournament began sharing Madison Square Garden with the NIT. In 1945, following victories by the NCAA champions over the NIT champions in the Red Cross games, \"The New York Times\" indicated that many teams who could potentially get bids to enter either tournament would probably choose the NCAA tournament \"because it involves stronger competition.\" In 1950, City College of New York won both the NIT and the NCAA tournaments in the same season, coincidentally defeating Bradley University in the championship game of both tournaments, and thus united the titles.\n", "In 1939, another national tournament was implemented by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The location of the NCAA Tournament varied from year to year, and it soon used multiple locations each year, so more fans could see games without traveling to New York. Although the NIT was created earlier and was more prestigious than the NCAA for many years, it ultimately lost popularity and status to the NCAA Tournament. In 1950, following a double win by the 1949\u201350 CCNY Beavers men's basketball team (when the NIT comprised 12 and the NCAA 8 teams), the NCAA ruled that no team could compete in both tournaments, and effectively indicated that a team eligible for the NCAA tournament should play in it. Not long afterward, assisted by the 1951 scandals based in New York City, the NCAA tournament had become more prestigious than before, with conference champions and the majority of top-ranked teams competing there. The NCAA tournament eventually overtook the NIT by 1960. Through the 1960s and 1970s, with UCLA leading the way as winner of ten NCAA Tournament championships, a shift in power to teams from the west amplified the shift of attention away from the New York City-based NIT. When the NCAA tournament expanded its field of teams from 25 to 32 in 1975, to 48 in 1980, to 64 in 1985, and to 68 teams in 2011, interest in the NCAA tournament increased again and again, as it comprised more and more teams, soon including all of the strongest ones. (Expansion also improved the distribution of playing locations, which number roughly one-third the number of teams in the field.)\n", "BULLET::::- During 1939, Long Island University finished the regular season unbeaten but decided to accept instead an invitation to the second NIT (which they won) instead of the first and only NABC tournament (later called the NCAA tournament), as the NIT was more prestigious at the time. It wasn't until the mid-1950s that the NCAA required that its tournament would have \"first choice\" in determining teams for their field. Before then, many of the more successful teams during the regular season chose to play in the NIT instead of the NCAA tournament.\n", "After the fall-out from the 1951 gambling and point-shaving scandals, the NCAA tournament pulled out of Madison Square Garden. With conference champions and the majority of the top-ranked teams participating in it, the NCAA tournament since then came to be regarded as the more important post-season tourney and the sole determiner of the national championship, although following the taint of the gambling scandals, the NIT was still considered a quality tournament for some time afterward. The NCAA built on the momentum of three consecutive Red Cross \"mythical national championship\" game victories over the NIT, eventually outmaneuvering the NIT by adeptly avoiding permanent damage from the 1951 gambling and point-shaving scandals and by adding more teams. As the NCAA Tournament steadily gained preeminence and became the sole source of naming the national champion, winners of the NCAA Tournament during those early years were given the same level of honor.\n", "The National Commissioners Invitational Tournament was an eight-team postseason college men's basketball tournament run by the NCAA. It was introduced in 1974 as the Collegiate Commissioners Association Tournament. It was created because the NCAA wanted to \"kill\" the NIT, which, at that time, it did not control. It only lasted two years before being discontinued after changes to the NCAA Tournament which allowed more than one team per conference to participate.\n", "The inaugural National Invitation Tournament (NIT) was held in 1938. The following season, a second postseason college basketball tournament was founded: the NCAA Tournament, which was originally organized by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), although the NCAA did consider the event its basketball championship. The concept of the tournament was pitched to the association by Ohio State coach Harold Olsen. In October 1938, the NCAA announced that it approved the tournament's creation, as long as it was run by the NABC. The tournament featured an eight-team field, consisting of conference champions. The teams were divided into East and West regions.\n", "As the NCAA tournament expanded its field to include more teams, the reputation of the NIT suffered. In 1973, NBC moved televised coverage of the NCAA championship from Saturday afternoon to Monday evening, providing the NCAA Tournament with prime-time television exposure the NIT could not match. Even more crucially, when the NCAA eliminated the one-team-per-conference rule in 1975, its requirement that teams accept its bids relegated the NIT to a collection of teams that did not make the NCAA grade.\n", "In 2005, the NCAA purchased 10-year rights to the NIT from the MIBA for $56.5 million to settle an antitrust lawsuit, which had gone to trial and was being argued until very shortly before the settlement was announced. The MIBA alleged that compelling teams to accept invitations to the NCAA tournament even if they preferred to play in the NIT was an illegal use of the NCAA's powers. In addition, it argued that the NCAA's expansion of its tournament to 65 teams (68 since 2011) was designed specifically to bankrupt the NIT. Faced with the very real possibility of being found in violation of federal antitrust law for the third time in its history, the NCAA chose to settle. (The first two violations were related to restrictions on televising college football and capping assistant coach salaries.) As part of the purchase of the NIT by the NCAA, the MIBA disbanded.\n", "The first men's national championship tournament, the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball tournament, which still exists as the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) tournament, was organized in 1937. The first national championship for NCAA teams, the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in New York, was organized in 1938; the NCAA national tournament would begin one year later. College basketball was rocked by gambling scandals from 1948 to 1951, when dozens of players from top teams were implicated in match fixing and point shaving. Partially spurred by an association with cheating, the NIT lost support to the NCAA tournament.\n", "BULLET::::- NIT : The National Invitation Tournament, a postseason tournament for NCAA Division I men's basketball teams that do not qualify for the NCAA Tournament. Founded in 1938, a year before the NCAA Tournament, it is closely identified with New York City; all games were originally held at the third Madison Square Garden, and to this day the semifinals and final are held at today's Madison Square Garden. In its early years, it was considered more prestigious than the NCAA Tournament, but this changed starting in the 1950s.
