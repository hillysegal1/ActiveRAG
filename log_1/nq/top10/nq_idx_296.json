The United Kingdom held a referendum on **June 23, 2016**, where the electorate voted on whether to remain in or leave the European Union. The result was that **51.9%** voted to leave, which indicated a clear decision by the electorate. This referendum marked the initial decision point, as it was the first time the public was directly asked to express their preference regarding EU membership.\n\nFollowing the referendum, the UK government began the formal process of negotiating its exit from the EU. This was initiated by invoking **Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union** on **March 29, 2017**, which formally notified the EU of the UK's intention to leave. The invocation of Article 50 set a two-year timeline for the exit process, initially targeting **March 29, 2019**, as the departure date.\n\nHowever, the exit date was subject to extensions due to ongoing negotiations and political developments, including the need for parliamentary approval and public sentiment regarding the terms of the exit. The exit was extended to **April 12, 2019**, and then again to **October 31, 2019**. Ultimately, the UK formally left the EU on **January 31, 2020**.\n\nIn addition to these events, it is important to consider the legal context surrounding the decision. The European Court of Justice ruled in December 2018 that the UK could legally revoke Article 50, which opened discussions about the possibility of remaining in the EU. This highlights the complexity of the decision-making process, where legal interpretations and political debates played significant roles.\n\nMoreover, the regional responses within the UK, particularly from Scotland and Northern Ireland, demonstrated that the decision to leave was not uniformly supported across the country. This regional variability adds another layer of complexity to the reasoning process, as it indicates that the decision to leave was influenced by diverse perspectives and sentiments.\n\n### Answer:\nThe decision to leave the EU was made on **June 23, 2016**, during the referendum, where **51.9%** of voters chose to leave.
