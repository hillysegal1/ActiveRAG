The killer is revealed to be the Reverse-Flash, also known as Eobard Thawne. \n\n1. **Causal Relationship**: The Reverse-Flash travels back in time with the specific intention of killing Nora Allen. This action is not random; it is a calculated move aimed at creating a tragedy in Barry's life. The Reverse-Flash believes that by eliminating Nora, he can prevent Barry from becoming the Flash, thus altering the timeline to his advantage.\n\n2. **Motivation**: Eobard Thawne's motivation is rooted in his desire to eliminate Barry as a threat. He perceives Barry's future self as a significant obstacle to his own plans. By killing Nora, he aims to create a traumatic event that will lead to Barry's emotional turmoil and ultimately prevent him from achieving his potential as a superhero.\n\n3. **Outcome**: Nora's death has profound implications for Barry. It serves as a driving force behind his quest for justice and understanding of his powers. Throughout the series, Barry's journey is heavily influenced by the loss of his mother, leading him to confront the Reverse-Flash multiple times. This cyclical nature of revenge and confrontation highlights the interconnectedness of their fates.\n\n4. **Character Development**: Barry's character is defined by his response to his mother's murder. His motivations for becoming the Flash are deeply intertwined with his desire to protect others from experiencing similar loss. This character arc illustrates how past traumas can shape an individual's future actions and decisions.\n\n5. **Narrative Structure**: The narrative structure of \"The Flash\" is built around the consequences of time travel and the ripple effects of actions taken by characters. The killing of Nora Allen is a catalyst that sets off a chain reaction of events, leading to Barry's development as a hero and his ongoing battle against the Reverse-Flash.\n\n6. **Emotional and Psychological Insights**: The emotional weight of Nora's death provides a rich backdrop for exploring themes of loss, revenge, and redemption. Understanding the psychological motivations behind Thawne's actions and Barry's responses allows for a deeper analysis of character interactions and conflicts throughout the series.\n\n### Answer:\nEobard Thawne (the Reverse-Flash) kills Barry's mom, Nora Allen, as part of a calculated plan to alter the timeline and prevent Barry from becoming the Flash.
