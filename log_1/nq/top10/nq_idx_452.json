For instance, properties may be owned by different investment groups or companies, which can lead to changes in branding and operational strategies.\n\n3. **Recent Ownership Changes**:\n   - The passages indicate that ownership of Crowne Plaza properties has changed hands multiple times. For example, in **September 2017**, a property was sold to **EOS DCH Owner LLC** and disassociated from the Crowne Plaza brand. This highlights that while IHG owns the brand, individual properties may have different owners.\n\n4. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - Ownership transitions often correlate with financial transactions, strategic decisions, and market conditions.
