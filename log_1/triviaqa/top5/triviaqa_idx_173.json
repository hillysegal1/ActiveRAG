A standard Scrabble board is a square grid consisting of 15 rows and 15 columns, making a total of 225 squares.\n2. On a Scrabble board, there are specific squares that provide bonuses for the words formed on them. One of these bonuses is the double-word score.\n3. The double-word score squares are marked in a specific color (usually pink) on the board.\n4. To determine the number of double-word score squares, we can refer to the standard layout of a Scrabble board.\n5. Upon examining the board layout, we find that double-word score squares are located at specific coordinates:\n   - (1, 1), (1, 15), (15, 1), (15, 15) - the four corners of the board.\n   - Additionally, there are double-word score squares at (1, 8), (8, 1), (8, 15), and (15, 8).\n6. Counting these squares, we find:\n   - 4 corner squares\n   - 4 middle edge squares\n7. Therefore, the total number of double-word score squares is 4 (corners) + 4 (edges) = 8.\n\nAnswer:\nThere are 8 double-word score squares on a standard Scrabble board.\nTo update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions. \nI retrieved some knowledge that may update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions\nNote that these passages are retrieved from the most authoritative knowledge repositories, so they are assumed to be correct.\nknowledge:\nTo address the question regarding the number of double-word score squares on a standard Scrabble board, we can analyze the provided passages for relevant information.\n\n1. **Passage Analysis**:\n   - The first passage mentions that the Scrabble board is a 15-by-15 grid and includes 164 squares that have neither word nor letter multiplier.
