The prefix \"zoo-\" is derived from the Greek word \"zoon,\" meaning \"animal,\" while the suffix \"-phobia\" refers to an irrational fear or aversion. Thus, we can initially infer that zoophobia relates to animals in general.\n\nHowever, based on the retrieved passages, we can refine this understanding:\n\n1. **Specificity of the Fear**: Zoophobia is characterized as a non-sensible fear of dangerous or threatening animals, such as wild dogs (including wolves, dingoes, and coyotes), big cats, bears, and venomous snakes. This indicates that zoophobia is not merely a general fear of all animals but specifically pertains to those perceived as dangerous.\n\n2. **Impact on Daily Life**: The passages highlight that zoophobia can lead to significant distress or dysfunction in an individual's everyday life. This aspect emphasizes the serious implications of the phobia on mental health and daily functioning, which is an important consideration that should be included in the model's understanding.\n\n3. **Broader Classification**: Zoophobia is described as a class of specific phobias related to particular animals or an irrational fear or dislike of any non-human animals. This broadens the definition to encompass not only fears of dangerous animals but also a general aversion to all non-human animals.\n\n4. **Terminology**: The passages also refer to zoophobia as \"animal phobia,\" which can be a useful synonym for the model to recognize, enhancing its understanding of the term.\n\nIn summary, the enhanced inference process reveals that:\n- Zoophobia is specifically a fear of dangerous animals, rather than just any animals.\n- It can cause significant distress or dysfunction in daily life.\n- It includes a broader category of irrational fears or dislikes of non-human animals.\n- The term \"animal phobia\" can be used interchangeably with zoophobia.\n\nBy incorporating this refined understanding, we can prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions regarding zoophobia.\n\n**Answer**: Zoophobia is a fear of dangerous or threatening animals, such as wild dogs, big cats, bears, and venomous snakes, and can also refer to an irrational fear or dislike of any non-human animals."}], "question_info": {"question": "What is zoophobia a fear of?", "passages": ["Zoophobia\n", "Zoophobia is the non-sensible fear of dangerous or threatening animals, such as wild dogs (example: wolves, dingoes, and coyotes), big cats, bears or venomous snakes.
