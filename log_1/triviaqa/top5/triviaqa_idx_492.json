In this scene, Macbeth experiences a hallucination of a dagger that leads him toward King Duncan's chamber, symbolizing his ambition and the moral conflict he faces regarding the murder he is contemplating to fulfill his desire for power.\n\nUpon reviewing the retrieved passages, it is clear that none of them correctly attribute this specific quote to Macbeth. Instead, they mention other characters and their associations with daggers, which could lead to confusion. For instance:\n\n1. The first passage discusses Hamlet but is not relevant to the quote in question.\n2. The second passage mentions \"Dagger before Me\" without clarifying the speaker.\n3. The third passage refers to a spectral dagger in \"Macbeth\" but does not provide the specific quote or its speaker.\n4. The fourth passage discusses Juliet's line \"O happy dagger!\" from \"Romeo and Juliet,\" which is unrelated to the quote.\n5. The fifth passage contains various references to daggers but does not address the specific quote or its speaker.\n\nTo enhance the reasoning process, it is essential to clarify that the quote is indeed from \"Macbeth\" and to emphasize that it reflects Macbeth's internal struggle and foreshadows his subsequent actions. This correction is vital for ensuring accurate attribution and understanding of the context in which the quote is delivered.\n\nThus, the model's knowledge should be updated to include the correct attribution of the quote to Macbeth in \"Macbeth,\" specifically in Act 2, Scene 1.\n\n**Answer:**\nMacbeth"}], "question_info": {"question": "\"Who says \"\"Is this a dagger that I see before me\"\" in a Shakespearean play?\"", "passages": ["Example: Hamlet saying \"I will speak daggers\" \u2014 a catachresis since one cannot literally \"speak a dagger.\"\n", "\"Dagger before Me\", Hammond, 1957\n", "BULLET::::- The word \"dagger\" was not a common word for people to use at the time.
