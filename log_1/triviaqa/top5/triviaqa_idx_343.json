The 8th President served from 1837 to 1841. \n\nFrom the retrieved passages, we find the following relevant information:\n1. **Identification of the 8th President**: The passage states, \"Martin Van Buren (1782\u20131862) was the eighth President of the United States.\" This confirms that Van Buren is indeed the 8th President.\n2. **Confirmation of Term Dates**: Another passage specifies, \"BULLET::::- Martin Van Buren becomes the 8th President of the United States on March 4, 1837.\" This provides the exact date he took office, further solidifying the accuracy of the claim.\n3. **Contextual Information**: The passage about William Henry Harrison states, \"William Henry Harrison (1773\u20131841) was the 9th President of the United States.\" This information is not contradictory but rather confirms the sequence of presidencies, as Harrison succeeded Van Buren.\n\n### Summary of Updates to Model Knowledge:\n- The model should be updated to confirm that Martin Van Buren served as the 8th President of the United States from March 4, 1837, to March 4, 1841. This information is consistent across multiple passages and reinforces the accuracy of the claim.\n- The model should also recognize that the order of presidencies is critical to understanding U.S. history, ensuring that it does not confuse Van Buren's presidency with that of Harrison.\n\nBy integrating this information, the model can reduce the likelihood of factual errors and enhance its reliability in answering questions about historical figures and events.\n\n### Answer:\nMartin Van Buren was the 8th President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1837, to March 4, 1841."}], "question_info": {"question": "Who was the 8th President of the United States from 1837- 1841?", "passages": ["William Henry Harrison (1773\u20131841) was the 9th President of the United States.\n", "Martin Van Buren (1782\u20131862) was the eighth President of the United States.\n", "BULLET::::- Martin Van Buren becomes the 8th President of the United States on March 4, 1837\n", "Edward Clark (April 1, 1815May 4, 1880) was the eighth Governor of Texas.
