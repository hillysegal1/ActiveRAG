The first set of treaties was established in 1899, and a second set followed in 1907. These conventions were pivotal in shaping international humanitarian law.\n\n2. **Hague Convention of 1899**: This convention included several important regulations regarding the conduct of war. It addressed the laws and customs of war on land and included provisions on the use of certain types of weapons. Notably, it prohibited the use of bullets that easily expand or flatten in the body (Declaration III) and prohibited the use of chemical weapons, including poison and poisoned arms.\n\n3. **Hague Convention of 1907**: This convention expanded upon the 1899 agreements and included additional regulations regarding the use of weapons, the treatment of civilians, and the conduct of hostilities. It reaffirmed and updated many of the principles established in the earlier convention. Specifically, it included:\n   - **Hague IV**: Laws and Customs of War on Land, which provided comprehensive rules for land warfare.\n   - **Hague IX**: Laws of War: Bombardment by Naval Forces in Time of War, which specifically addresses the conduct of naval bombardment.\n\n4. **Specific Articles**: Both conventions contain articles that specifically address the use of certain types of weapons, such as the prohibition of projectiles intended to spread asphyxiating gas or similar materials.
