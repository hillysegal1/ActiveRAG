This initial construction serves as the foundational cause for the existence of the Palace. In 1634, Louis XIII further enlarged this hunting lodge into a chateau, marking a significant transformation of the original structure and establishing a more substantial cause for its development.\n\nLater, Louis XIV, beginning in 1661, recognized the potential of Versailles and commissioned architects Louis Le Vau and Charles Le Brun, along with landscape architect Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre, to expand and renovate the palace. This decision was driven by Louis XIV's desire to create a new center for the royal court, illustrating a direct causal relationship between his ambitions and the architectural developments that followed.\n\nThe project saw a transition in leadership when Louis Le Vau passed away in 1670, and Jules Hardouin-Mansart took over. This shift not only indicates a change in responsibility but also reflects the evolving architectural style and vision for the palace. Hardouin-Mansart continued to enhance the estate, constructing notable structures such as the Grand Trianon, which further exemplifies the cumulative impact of various architects over time.\n\nBy analyzing these events, we can identify a clear sequence of causation: the original construction by Louis XIII led to subsequent enlargements and renovations by Louis XIV and his architects. This sequence highlights the importance of understanding how individual actions and decisions contribute to larger historical outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, the model can infer that the architectural decisions made by Louis XIV were influenced by previous designs, such as Vaux-le-Vicomte, demonstrating the interconnectedness of historical developments.
