The first passage clearly states that Cort\u00e9s seized Moctezuma on November 14, 1519, which was a critical moment that initiated a series of violent confrontations between the Spaniards and the Aztecs.

His death, occurring shortly after his deposition, raises questions about the nature of his leadership and the extent of his control during the Spanish conquest. The ambiguity surrounding the details of his death further emphasizes the chaotic environment in which these events unfolded.\n\n5. **Historical Significance**: The synthesis of these passages reveals that Moctezuma II's deposition was not merely a result of Cort\u00e9s's military actions but also a reflection of the internal strife within the Aztec Empire.

The key ruler during this time was Moctezuma II, the ninth emperor of the Aztec Empire. \n\n1. **Cort\u00e9s's Arrival and Actions**: Upon arriving in Mexico, Cort\u00e9s captured Moctezuma II on November 14, 1519. This act was significant as it disrupted the existing leadership structure of the Aztec Empire. Moctezuma was held captive and used as a figurehead, which created a power vacuum and led to instability within the Aztec governance.\n\n2. **Deposition of Moctezuma**: While Cort\u00e9s was away dealing with other Spanish forces, the Aztec ruling council decided to depose Moctezuma. They elected his brother, Cuitlahuac, as the new emperor. This decision was a direct response to the chaos and unrest caused by Cort\u00e9s's actions, highlighting how Cort\u00e9s's initial capture of Moctezuma led to a significant shift in power.\n\n3. **Cuitlahuac's Brief Reign**: Cuitlahuac's reign was short-lived, lasting only about 40 to 80 days before he died of smallpox. His election and subsequent leadership were influenced by the turmoil created by Cort\u00e9s, demonstrating the direct consequences of the Spanish invasion on Aztec leadership.\n\n4. **Consequences of Cort\u00e9s's Actions**: The overall impact of Cort\u00e9s's actions included significant unrest among the Aztecs, leading to resistance against the Spanish. The deposition of Moctezuma and the rise of Cuitlahuac were pivotal moments that illustrated the cascading effects of Cort\u00e9s's invasion.\n\n5. **Causal Relationships**: The reasoning process highlights a clear causal chain: Cort\u00e9s's capture of Moctezuma led to a power vacuum, which resulted in the council's decision to depose him and elect Cuitlahuac. This sequence of events underscores the importance of understanding how individual actions can lead to broader historical changes.\n\n6. **Temporal Dynamics**: The timing of events is crucial. Cort\u00e9s's absence during the council's decision to depose Moctezuma illustrates how the dynamics of power can shift rapidly in response to changing circumstances.\n\nBy synthesizing these points, we can see that the actions of Cort\u00e9s not only led to the deposition of Moctezuma II but also set in motion a series of events that would ultimately contribute to the fall of the Aztec Empire.\n\n### Answer:\nMoctezuma II was the Aztec ruler deposed by Cort\u00e9s."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nWhich Aztec ruler was deposed by Cortez?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['On 14 November 1519, Cortes seized the emperor Moctezuma II and ordered the destruction of all the religious relics of the Aztecs.
