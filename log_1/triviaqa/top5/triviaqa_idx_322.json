James contacted John Elliot, the assistant head of the BBC Script Department, who was interested in making a science fiction serial. Elliot, along with James and BBC script editor Donald Bull, met with Hoyle who outlined a potential story for an eight-part serial; this was what would eventually become \"A for Andromeda\". Hoyle drew his inspiration for the serial from the work of astronomer Frank Drake who at that time had begun \"Project Ozma\", one of the first experiments in the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI).
