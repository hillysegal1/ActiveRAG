The term \"centigrade\" was historically used until 1948, when it was renamed to honor the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius. The name \"centigrade\" comes from Latin, meaning \"hundred steps\" (from \"centum\" for 100 and \"gradus\" for steps), which reflects the scale's design based on these two critical temperature points.\n\nThe Celsius scale is widely adopted as an SI derived unit globally, although some countries, such as the United States, still prefer the Fahrenheit scale for everyday temperature measurement. The degree Celsius (\u00b0C) can indicate a specific temperature or a temperature difference, making it versatile in scientific contexts.\n\nThe adoption of the term \"Celsius\" was primarily to avoid confusion with other uses of \"centigrade,\" particularly in angular measurement, where it could lead to ambiguity. This change highlights the importance of clarity and precision in scientific communication, which is essential for effective understanding and collaboration across disciplines.\n\nCultural and linguistic variations also play a role in the terminology used. While \"centigrade\" was common in various languages, its dual meaning necessitated the shift to \"Celsius\" to ensure unambiguous communication in scientific and educational contexts.\n\nBy understanding the historical evolution of these terms, we can recognize how terminology influences scientific discourse and public perception.

This scale is widely used around the world, especially in scientific contexts. However, it is more commonly referred to by another name in many countries, particularly in English-speaking regions.
