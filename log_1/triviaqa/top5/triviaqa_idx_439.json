Lipski (1994) also considers the dialect of northern coastal Peru as a distinct variety of Spanish, based on phonetic features.\n", "Regional relations remain good despite occasional issues with neighbors, especially regarding spillover from Colombia's armed conflict, including cross-border guerrilla crossings, the flow of refugees, and the spread of drug crops. These issues are of particular concern to the bordering countries of Brazil, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. For example, Ecuador has closed its main border crossing with Colombia every night since August 2002, when evidence emerged that Colombian guerrillas and paramilitaries were asserting control over Ecuador's border communities. On May 1, 2004, Ecuador placed further stringent visa restrictions on Colombians seeking to enter Ecuador. Relations with Nicaragua and Venezuela have been strained over territorial disputes. Bilateral committees are negotiating the dispute with Venezuela over waters in the Gulf of Venezuela. Other issues with Venezuela include the presence of illegal undocumented Colombians in Venezuela, and activities of Colombian narcotics traffickers, and Venezuela's support for the Guerrillas in Colombia.\n"], "__answers__": ["Rep\u00fablica de Colombia", "Colombia", "Colombia", "Colombia", "Republic of Colombia", "rep\u00fablica de colombia", "colombia", "republic of colombia", "Etymology of Colombia", "Republica de Colombia", "colombi\u00e1", "etymology of colombia", "iso 3166 1 co", "Name of Colombia", "name of colombia", "Republic of Columbia", "republica de colombia", "Colombi\u00e1", "republic of columbia", "The Republic of Colombia", "ISO 3166-1:CO"]}}
