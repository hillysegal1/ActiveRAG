However, the first 24-hour race on a closed course occurred earlier, at Brooklands in England.\n\n2. **Event Timing and Location**:\n   - The race took place on **28\u201329 June 1907**, just eleven days after the opening of Brooklands on **17 June 1907**. This indicates that the event was significant in establishing endurance racing as a recognized format.\n\n3. **Participants and Format**:\n   - The race featured **three specially converted Napier cars**. Selwyn Edge drove one car for the entire duration, while the other drivers used a shift approach. This highlights the endurance aspect of the race, which is a key characteristic of 24-hour events.\n\n4. **Significance of the Event**:\n   - The use of over **300 red railway lamps** to illuminate the track and the marking of boundaries with flares demonstrate the logistical planning involved in conducting such an event. This was a pioneering effort in motorsport, setting a precedent for future endurance races.\n\n5. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - The opening of Brooklands as a dedicated motorsport venue directly facilitated the organization of the first 24-hour race. This illustrates how infrastructure can lead to the development of new racing formats.\n\n6. **Technological and Safety Considerations**:\n   - The modifications made to the cars for performance and the safety measures implemented during the race reflect the evolving nature of motorsport technology and event management practices.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy consolidating and analyzing the extracted information, we can conclude that the first 24-hour race for motor cars on a closed course in 1907 was held at Brooklands, which is located in England.
