First, we need to understand the fractions involved in the problem. We have two fractions: five ninths (5/9) and three fifths (3/5).\n2. To find \"five ninths of three fifths,\" we need to multiply these two fractions together.\n3. The multiplication of two fractions is done by multiplying the numerators together and the denominators together. So, we will multiply the numerators (5 and 3) and the denominators (9 and 5).\n4. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Numerator: 5 * 3 = 15\n   - Denominator: 9 * 5 = 45\n5. Therefore, the result of multiplying the two fractions is 15/45.\n6. We can simplify this fraction. Both the numerator and denominator can be divided by 15:\n   - 15 \u00f7 15 = 1\n   - 45 \u00f7 15 = 3\n7.
