Chuck Berry is a seminal figure in rock and roll music, and his career began in the 1950s.\n\n1. **Chess Records**: The primary label associated with Chuck Berry during the 1950s is Chess Records, which he signed with in 1955. This label is known for producing many of his classic hits, including \"Maybellene,\" \"Roll Over Beethoven,\" and \"Johnny B.
