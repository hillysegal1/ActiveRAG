This pattern recognition can aid in predicting the content or intent of other texts by the same author.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy synthesizing the authorship and contextual influences of both works, I can conclude that the author of both 'The Shortest Way with Dissenters' and 'A Journey of the Plague Year' is **Daniel Defoe**.
