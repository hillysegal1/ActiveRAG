During this critical period, the reigning monarch was King George III, who ascended to the throne in 1760 and ruled until 1820.\n\nKing George III's reign was marked by significant political turmoil and colonial unrest, primarily driven by issues such as taxation without representation and the desire for greater autonomy among the American colonies.

The war concluded with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which recognized the independence of the American colonies. \n\nDuring this entire period, the monarch was King George III, who reigned from 1760 until 1820.

They focus on unrelated historical topics, such as Irish maritime history, an Irish explorer, and events from the 14th century and the 18th-century Anglo-Dutch War. Therefore, they do not contribute to answering the question about the king during the loss of the American colonies.\n\nTo ensure the language model has accurate historical context, it is crucial to affirm that King George III was the king of Great Britain and Ireland at the time the American colonies were lost in 1783.

The Maritime Institute of Ireland acquired some of the paintings; they concentrated on ships lost during World War II.
