Initially, in 1712, Peter the Great moved the capital from Moscow to St. Petersburg. This move was part of his broader efforts to modernize Russia and create a new cultural and political center that aligned more closely with Western Europe. St. Petersburg was strategically located on the Neva River and was designed to serve as a \"window to the West.\"\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the capital was not permanently established in St. Petersburg. In 1728, the capital was moved back to Moscow under the influence of the Supreme Privy Council. This indicates that the political landscape was dynamic, and the decision to relocate the capital was influenced by various factors at the time. \n\nAdditionally, a specific date is noted: on May 19, 1713 (May 8 in the Julian calendar), the capital was officially moved from Moscow to St. Petersburg. This detail provides a clearer timeline of the transition.\n\nThe capital's return to Moscow in 1728 emphasizes the transitional nature of the capital during the 18th century, highlighting that St. Petersburg was not the sole capital throughout this period. This understanding corrects any oversimplification in the model's knowledge that might suggest a static capital.\n\nBy integrating this information, the model can better reflect the historical context and avoid inaccuracies related to the capital of Russia during the 18th century.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe capital of Russia was moved from Moscow to St. Petersburg in 1712, but it was moved back to Moscow in 1728."}], "question_info": {"question": "In the 18th century, the capital of Russia was moved from Moscow to where?", "passages": ["BULLET::::- 1712 \u2013 Russian capital relocated from Moscow to Saint Petersburg.\n", "BULLET::::- 1728 - Russian capital moved back to Moscow under influence of the Supreme Privy Council.\n", "BULLET::::- May 19 (May 8 in the Julian calendar), 1713\u00a0\u2014 the capital of Russia was moved from Moscow to St.\u00a0Petersburg.\n", "BULLET::::- 1728 \u2013 State capital moves to Moscow from St. Petersburg.\n", "Following the success of the Russian Revolution of 1917, Vladimir Lenin, fearing possible foreign invasion, moved the capital from Saint Petersburg back to Moscow on March 12, 1918. \n"], "__answers__": ["St. Petersburg", "St. Petersburg", "Saint Petersburg", "Saint Petersburg", "Petersburg, Russia", "Saint Petersburg, Russia", "Petrograd", "St Petersburg", "Leningrad", "Leningrad", "Pietarissa", "saint peterburg russia", "Saint Peterburg", "Monuments of Saint Petersburg", "St. Petursburg", "\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434", "leningrad russia", "st petersburg russia", "Saint Petersberg", "Saint Petersburgh", "Sankt Petersburg", "St Petersb.", "St. petersburg", "\u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433", "St. petersbourg", "Saint-Petersburg", "Piter, Russia", "st petersberg", "st petersbourg", "petrograd", "RU-SPE", "leningrad soviet union", "\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442 \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433", "lenningrad", "un locode ruled", "st petersb", "\u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434", "leningrad", "Peter, Russia", "Saint-Peterburg", "russia st petersburg", "peterpolis", "peter russia", "ru spe", "Sankt Pieterburg", "saint petersburg russia federation", "St-Petersburg", "landscrona", "saint petersburg city", "leningrad ussr", "monuments of saint petersburg", "St petersbourg", "St. Petersberg", "UN/LOCODE:RULED", "saint petersberg", "saint peterburg", "Sankt-Petersburg", "st petersburgh", "saint petersburgh", "St Petersburg, Russia", "sankt petrburg", "St Petersberg", "Lenningrad", "Leningrad, Russia", "st petersburg", "piter russia", "Peterpolis", "Sankt-Peterburg Federal City, Russia", "pietarissa", "sankt petersburg", "St. Peterburg", "Saint Petersburg, Russia (Federation)", "peterburi", "Saint petersburg", "art pictures st petersburg", "Peterburi", "Peterburg", "Saint Petersburg City", "Sankt-Peterburg", "st petersburg russa", "St. Petersburg, Russa", "St petersburg", "sankt pieterburg", "Saint Peterburg, Russia", "Landscrona", "sankt peterburg federal city russia", "saint petersburg", "Art Pictures St. Petersburg", "St. Petersburg, Russia", "saint petersburg russia", "peterpole", "Leningrad, USSR", "sankt peterburg", "Leningrad, Soviet Union", "Sankt Peterburg", "st peterburg", "st petursburg", "Russia St. Petersburg", "Peterpole", "Saint Petersburg (Russia)", "Sankt Petrburg", "petersburg russia", "St. Petersburgh", "St.Petersburg", "peterburg"]}}
