Myanmar was previously known as \"Burma,\" a name that originated during British colonial rule and continued to be used after the country gained independence in 1948. \n\nThe name \"Myanmar\" was officially adopted in 1989 by the military government, which marked a significant shift in the country's identity. However, many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, still refer to the country as \"Burma,\" reflecting a lack of recognition of the name change due to political reasons. This discrepancy highlights the complexities surrounding the name and its acceptance in different contexts.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to note that there are two different names for the country in Burmese, which are used in varying contexts. This linguistic nuance suggests that the choice of name can be influenced by cultural and political factors. Furthermore, in various languages, Myanmar is referred to differently, such as \"Birmania\" in Spanish, \"Birm\u00e2nia\" in Portuguese, and \"Birmanie\" in French, indicating the global recognition of the prior name.\n\nThe political implications of the name change are also significant. The party that won the 1990 election, which was denied power by the junta, opposes the new name \"Myanmar.\" This context adds depth to the understanding of why some regions and individuals continue to use \"Burma.\"\n\nBy integrating these details, we can provide a more nuanced and accurate response to the question.\n\n**Answer:**\nBurma"}], "question_info": {"question": "The country Myanmar is still known in many parts of the world by what prior name?", "passages": ["The country's official full name is the \"Republic of the Union of Myanmar\" (, \"\", ).
