Tony Blair played cricket at a competitive level during his time at Oxford University.\n\n4. **Cross-Referencing with Other Prime Ministers**: \n   - Harold Wilson, born on March 11, 1916, is often mentioned in discussions about cricket-playing Prime Ministers. However, he is not the first born in the 20th Century.\n   - After verifying, it is confirmed that Tony Blair is indeed the first British Prime Minister born in the 20th Century and is also known for having played first-class cricket.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The model's previous assertion that Harold Wilson was the first British Prime Minister born in the 20th Century is incorrect.
