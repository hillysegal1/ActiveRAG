This broad definition emphasizes that while fruits are the primary food source, frugivores may also consume a variety of other plant materials.\n\n2. **Types of Animals**:\n   - Frugivores can be herbivores or omnivores, indicating that both strictly plant-eating animals and those that also consume animal matter can exhibit frugivorous behavior. This diversity in dietary habits allows frugivores to adapt to different ecological niches.\n\n3. **Prevalence and Ecological Role**:\n   - Approximately 20% of all mammalian herbivores consume fruit, highlighting the significance of frugivory in mammalian diets. This prevalence suggests that frugivores play a vital role in their ecosystems, particularly in tropical and subtropical environments where fruit availability is high.\n\n4. **Dependency on Fruits**:\n   - Frugivores are highly dependent on the abundance and nutritional composition of fruits, which means that their populations can be affected by changes in fruit availability due to environmental factors, such as climate change or habitat destruction.\n\n5. **Ecological Interactions**:\n   - Frugivores can benefit fruit-producing plants by dispersing seeds, which is crucial for plant reproduction and the maintenance of biodiversity. However, they can also hinder plant reproduction by digesting seeds, which may prevent those seeds from germinating. This dual role underscores the complexity of their ecological interactions.\n\n6. **Mutualism**:\n   - The relationship between frugivores and fruit-producing plants is often mutualistic, meaning both parties benefit. Frugivores gain a food source, while plants benefit from seed dispersal, which can lead to greater genetic diversity and colonization of new areas.\n\n7. **Examples of Frugivores**:\n   - Common examples of frugivores include many species of birds (like parrots and toucans), bats, and primates (such as monkeys and apes). These animals have evolved specific adaptations, such as strong beaks or digestive systems, to efficiently consume and process fruits.\n\n8. **Implications for Ecosystems**:\n   - Understanding frugivory is essential for grasping broader ecological concepts, such as the dynamics of food webs, the importance of biodiversity, and the impact of frugivores on forest regeneration and health.\n\n### Answer:\nA frugivore feeds primarily on raw fruits, nuts, seeds, and other plant materials such as succulent fruit-like vegetables, roots, and shoots.

The term \"frugivore\" originates from the Latin word \"fructus,\" meaning fruit. These animals have specific adaptations that enable them to efficiently consume and digest various types of fruits and related plant materials. \n\nFrugivores can be categorized as either herbivores or omnivores, indicating a diversity in species that prefer fruit as a significant part of their diet. Common examples of frugivores include many species of birds, bats, and primates. \n\nEcologically, frugivores play a crucial role in ecosystems by aiding in seed dispersal, which is essential for plant reproduction.

It can be any type of herbivore or omnivore where fruit is a preferred food type. Because approximately 20% of all mammalian herbivores also eat fruit, frugivory is common among mammals. Since frugivores eat a lot of fruit, they are highly dependent on the abundance and nutritional composition of fruits. Frugivores can either benefit fruit-producing plants by dispersing seeds, or they can hinder plants by digesting seeds along with the fruits.
