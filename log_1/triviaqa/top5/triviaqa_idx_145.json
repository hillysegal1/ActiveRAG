The US Masters is one of the four major championships in professional golf, established in 1934.\n\nInitially, we may consider notable British golfers who have won the tournament. However, upon reviewing authoritative sources, we find that Sandy Lyle is recognized as the first British player to win the US Masters. This is confirmed by multiple passages retrieved, which state:\n\n1. \"Sandy Lyle becomes the first British player to win the U.S. Masters.\"\n2. \"10 April \u2013 Golfer Sandy Lyle becomes the first British winner of the US Masters.\"\n\nThese passages provide clear and verifiable information that directly addresses the question. In contrast, the model's previous assertion that Sir Nick Faldo was the first British winner is incorrect, as he won the tournament later, in 1989.\n\nThus, it is essential to update the model's knowledge to reflect that Sandy Lyle is indeed the first British golfer to win the US Masters, which corrects the factual error and alleviates any model illusions regarding this historical achievement.\n\n**Answer:**\nSandy Lyle"}], "question_info": {"question": "Who was the first British golfer to win the US Masters?", "passages": ["Sandy Lyle becomes the first British player to win the U.S. Masters.
