She was the great-granddaughter of Henry VII and was proclaimed queen after the death of Edward VI. However, her reign was extremely brief, lasting only nine days before she was deposed.\n\nTo accurately identify her husband, we must consider her historical context. Lady Jane Grey was married to Guildford Dudley, the son of John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland. This marriage was politically motivated, aimed at consolidating power for the Dudley family and bolstering Jane's claim to the throne.\n\nUpon reviewing the retrieved passages, the first passage erroneously states that Lady Jane Grey married George Drummond in 1738.
