The term \"Friars of St. Francis\" refers to members of the Franciscan order, which was founded by St. Francis of Assisi in 1209. The context of Wycombe, specifically High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, England, is crucial for understanding the local history and any events that may have contributed to their notoriety.\n\n1. **Historical Context**:\n   - The Franciscans established their presence in England with the founding of the Greyfriars church and friary in 1224. This indicates a long-standing history in the region, which may have led to various interactions with the local community.\n\n2. **Division of the Order**:\n   - The division of the Franciscans into \"Conventuals\" and \"Observants\" in 1517 reflects internal conflicts within the order, which may have influenced their reputation and actions in local contexts, including Wycombe.\n\n3. **Suppression During the Reformation**:\n   - The suppression of friaries during the Reformation in the 16th century significantly impacted the Franciscans' influence and presence in England. This historical backdrop is essential for understanding any controversies or conflicts that may have arisen, as the friars were often at odds with local authorities and changing religious sentiments.\n\n4. **Local Notoriety**:\n   - The term \"notorious\" suggests that the friars were involved in actions or events that were viewed negatively by the community or authorities. This could relate to their role in local disputes or their influence over community affairs, particularly during a time of significant religious upheaval.\n\n5. **Brotherhood of St. Francis of Wycombe**:\n   - The formation of the \"Brotherhood of St. Francis of Wycombe\" in 1752 indicates a revival of Franciscan ideals, which may have been perceived differently by the local populace. This group could have been seen as controversial, especially if it challenged existing social or religious norms.\n\n6. **Notable Figures**:\n   - Figures like Robert Grosseteste, who had a significant role in the history of the Franciscans, can provide insight into the order's influence and reputation. His association with the Greyfriars may have contributed to the perception of the friars in Wycombe.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy synthesizing this information, I can infer that the notorious Friars of St. Francis of Wycombe were likely involved in contentious local issues, influenced by the broader historical context of the Franciscan order's challenges during the Reformation and their eventual suppression. Their actions may have led to a reputation that was viewed negatively by some segments of the community.\n\n### Answer:\nThe notorious Friars of St. Francis of Wycombe refer to a group of Franciscan friars who were active in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, during the late medieval period. Their notoriety likely stems from their involvement in local disputes and their contentious relationship with the community, particularly during the Reformation when the Franciscans faced significant challenges. The friars were known for their influence over local affairs, which may have been perceived negatively by some. Additionally, the formation of the \"Brotherhood of St. Francis of Wycombe\" in 1752 suggests a revival of Franciscan ideals that could have further contributed to their controversial reputation in the area."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nWho were the notorious Friars of St Francis of Wycombe?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The original Greyfriars church and friary was founded by the Franciscans in 1224.
