Snowball is depicted as a pig, which is significant because the story uses animals to represent various political figures and ideologies, creating an allegorical narrative.\n\n1. **Character Representation**: Snowball's character is largely based on Trotsky, who was known for his intelligence and leadership during the early days of the Soviet Union. In the story, Snowball is portrayed as an intelligent and idealistic pig who advocates for the principles of Animalism, aiming to improve the lives of the other animals on the farm.\n\n2. **Allegorical Context**: The novella serves as an allegory for the Russian Revolution and its aftermath. Snowball's conflict with Napoleon, who represents Joseph Stalin, reflects the historical power struggle between Trotsky and Stalin. Snowball's eventual exile from the farm parallels Trotsky's exile from the Soviet Union, emphasizing themes of betrayal and the corrupting influence of power.\n\n3. **Character Traits**: Snowball is characterized by his eloquence and ability to inspire others, which contrasts sharply with Napoleon's more authoritarian and manipulative nature. This dynamic illustrates the tension between idealism and authoritarianism, as Snowball's vision for a better society is ultimately undermined by Napoleon's ruthless quest for power.\n\n4. **Film Adaptations**: Snowball's representation in various film adaptations, such as being depicted as a pink pig in the 1999 version and a white pig in the 1954 version, can influence audience perceptions and interpretations of his character.
