The retrieved passages do not provide the name of the individual who became Lord Tweedsmuir, indicating a gap in the information that could lead to confusion if the model lacks prior knowledge about John Buchan.\n6. The repeated references to \"The Rt Hon. The Lord Tweedsmuir\" across various years (1875\u20131940, 1945\u20131964, etc.) could mislead the model into thinking there were multiple individuals associated with this title without the context that these references pertain to John Buchan.\n7. To prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions, it is crucial to explicitly state that John Buchan is the writer and politician who became Lord Tweedsmuir, along with his notable role as Governor General of Canada and his literary achievements.\n\n**Answer:**\nJohn Buchan"}], "question_info": {"question": "Which writer and politician became Lord Tweedsmuir?", "passages": ["BULLET::::- The Lord Tweedsmuir (1875\u20131940)\n", "BULLET::::- 19451964: The Rt Hon.
