This understanding can enhance the model's ability to reason about linguistic evolution and the interconnectedness of languages.\n\n8. **Symbolic Meanings**: Unlike phonetic alphabets, the Futhark represents sounds and carries symbolic meanings. This distinction is important for understanding how different writing systems convey information and cultural significance.\n\n### Answer:\nThe Futhark is a runic alphabet used by various Germanic peoples, specifically for writing Northwest Germanic dialects. It is historically significant, with the Elder Futhark being the oldest form, used from the 2nd to the 8th centuries. The name \"Futhark\" comes from its first six letters, and it served both practical and cultural purposes, as evidenced by its inscriptions on artifacts.
