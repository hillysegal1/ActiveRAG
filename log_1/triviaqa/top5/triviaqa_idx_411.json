The essential oil extracted from this rose is highly valued in perfumery and aromatherapy for its rich, floral scent. The oil is often referred to by its common name, which is derived from the rose itself.

This oil, commonly referred to as rose oil or attar of roses, is extracted chiefly from the petals of the Damask Rose through a process called steam distillation. \n\nThe historical context of rose oil production is significant; it originated in Persia and later spread to regions such as Arabia, India, and eastern Europe. This cultural and geographical background enriches our understanding of the oil's significance in various traditions and practices.\n\nIn terms of production, it is noteworthy that the Damask Rose is specifically utilized in countries like Bulgaria, Iran, and Germany for rose oil extraction, while other varieties, such as *Rosa centifolia*, are also used in different parts of the world. This distinction highlights the diversity of rose species involved in the production of rose oil.\n\nAdditionally, the extraction yield is quite low, with approximately one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers being converted into oil. For instance, about two thousand flowers are needed to produce just one gram of rose oil. This quantitative detail emphasizes the labor-intensive nature of rose oil production.\n\nMoreover, rose water is an associated product derived from the same process, which has various applications in cooking, cosmetics, medicine, and religious practices. This information broadens the understanding of the uses of rose-derived products beyond just the essential oil.\n\nBy integrating these insights, the model can achieve a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of rose oil, particularly in relation to the Damask Rose, thereby reducing the potential for factual errors and addressing model illusions.\n\n**Answer:**\nRose oil (also known as attar of roses) is the fragrant essential oil obtained chiefly from the Damask Rose (*Rosa damascena*)."}], "question_info": {"question": "What is the name of the fragrant essential oil obtained chiefly from the Damask Rose?", "passages": ["Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses.
