The term \"Fitzroy\" can refer to various geographical locations, but in this case, it pertains to a sea area used in the UK Shipping Forecast.\n\nUpon reviewing authoritative sources, it is clear that the shipping area Fitzroy was previously known as \"Finisterre\" until the name change in 2002. This renaming was implemented to avoid confusion with another smaller sea area of the same name that is featured in marine forecasts produced by French and Spanish meteorological offices. This context is essential as it provides insight into the rationale behind the name change, which is not commonly known.\n\nThus, the model should update its knowledge to reflect that:\n- The Fitzroy sea area was formerly called Finisterre until 2002.\n- The renaming was intended to reduce confusion with similarly named areas in marine forecasts.\n\nThis enhanced understanding helps clarify the historical context and reasoning behind the name change, which can prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions regarding the name Fitzroy in maritime contexts.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe shipping area Fitzroy was known as Finisterre until 2002."}], "question_info": {"question": "By what name was the shipping area Fitzroy known until 2002?", "passages": ["Fitzroy is a former railway station which was on a branch of the Inner Circle line in Melbourne, Australia.
