This aligns with the model's existing knowledge and confirms that Gibraltar is indeed the specific British Overseas Territory in question.\n\n2. **Strategic Importance**: Gibraltar's location at the entrance of the Mediterranean Sea makes it a crucial naval base for the British. The Germans recognized its strategic value for controlling naval movements and supply routes, which further emphasizes why it was a target.\n\n3. **Broader Context**: The passages also mention that Operation Felix was part of a broader strategy that included potential invasions of other territories, such as Portugal, Madeira, and the Azores. This information provides a more comprehensive understanding of the strategic implications of Operation Felix beyond just Gibraltar.\n\n4. **Joint Plan**: The detail that Operation Felix was a \"Spanish/German joint plan\" highlights the collaborative aspect of the operation, which may not have been fully captured in the model's previous knowledge. This indicates that the plan involved coordination with Spain, which could have influenced its execution.\n\n5. **Invasion Route**: The mention of the invasion being planned via the Iberian Peninsula adds geographical context that enhances the understanding of the logistics involved in the operation.\n\n6. **Non-Initiation**: Importantly, the fact that the operation was never initiated clarifies the outcome of the plan and helps prevent any misconceptions about its execution. This detail is crucial for understanding the historical context of Operation Felix.\n\nBy integrating these points into the model's knowledge base, it can better grasp the nuances of Operation Felix, reducing the likelihood of model illusions and ensuring more accurate responses in the future.\n\n**Answer:**\nGibraltar"}], "question_info": {"question": "Operation Felix was the codename for a proposed German invasion of which British Overseas Territory during World War II?", "passages": ["BULLET::::- Operation Felix \u2013 The planned German invasion of Gibraltar\n", "BULLET::::- Operation Felix, a German World War II project to conquer Gibraltar\n", "BULLET::::- Operation Felix (Spanish/German joint plan for control of Gibraltar, Canary Islands, Cape Verde, and Azores)\n", "BULLET::::- Operation Felix 1940 - German planned invasion of Gibraltar via the Iberian Peninsula\n", "The Germans had planned an attack on Gibraltar, codenamed Operation Felix, which was never initiated.
