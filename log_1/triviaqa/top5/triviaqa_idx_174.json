The daffodil, particularly in the United Kingdom, is often referred to as the \"Lenten\" or \"Lent lily.\" This association arises because daffodils typically bloom in early spring, coinciding with the period of Lent.\n\nAdditionally, the scientific name for the wild daffodil is \"Narcissus pseudonarcissus,\" which is explicitly identified in the retrieved passages as also being known as the Lent lily. This reinforces the connection between the daffodil and the term \"Lent lily.\"\n\nIt is also important to distinguish between the Lent lily and the Easter lily. The Easter lily, known scientifically as \"Lilium longiflorum,\" is a separate species that holds its own significance in Christian symbolism, particularly related to Easter celebrations. Understanding this distinction helps clarify that while both flowers are linked to spring and religious observances, they refer to different plants.\n\nIn summary, the model should recognize that:\n1. The daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus) is commonly referred to as the Lent lily, especially in the UK.\n2. The term \"Lent lily\" can refer to the daffodil and potentially other species in different contexts.\n3. The Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum) is distinct from the Lent lily and should not be conflated with it.\n\nThis enhanced understanding will help ensure accurate identification and associations regarding the Lent lily.\n\n**Answer:**\nDaffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus)"}], "question_info": {"question": "Which flower is also known as the Lent Lily?", "passages": ["In western countries the daffodil is associated with spring festivals such as Lent and its successor Easter.

Tradition has it that the daffodil opens on Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent, and dies at Easter which marks the end of Lent.\n", "\"Lilium longiflorum\" is known as the Easter lily because in Christianity, it is a symbol of the resurrection of Christ, which is celebrated during Eastertide. The \"lily has always been highly regarded in the Church\", as Jesus Himself referenced the flower, saying \"Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these\" (). Moreover, according to pious legend, \"after Jesus' death and resurrection, some of these beautiful flowers were found growing in the Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus went to pray the night before His crucifixion. Legend has it that these flowers sprung up where drops of Jesus' sweat fell as he prayed\". In many Christian churches, the chancel is adorned with Easter lilies throughout the Paschal season.
