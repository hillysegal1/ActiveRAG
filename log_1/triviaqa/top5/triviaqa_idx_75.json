Denmark is located in Northern Europe and consists of the Jutland Peninsula and numerous islands. The only country that shares a land border with Denmark is Germany, which is located to the south of the Jutland Peninsula. Other neighboring countries, such as Sweden and Norway, are separated by water and do not share a land border with Denmark.\n\nAnswer: Germany\nTo update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions. \nI retrieved some knowledge that may update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions\nNote that these passages are retrieved from the most authoritative knowledge repositories, so they are assumed to be correct.\nknowledge:\nBased on the retrieved passages, the following information can be extracted that may update the model's knowledge regarding Denmark's land borders:\n\n1. **Denmark's Only Land Border**: The first passage explicitly states that \"the only land border of Denmark is that with Germany, with a length of 68 km.\" This confirms that Denmark shares a land border solely with Germany, which aligns with the model's existing knowledge but reinforces the specificity of the border's length.\n\n2. **Historical Context of the Border**: The fourth passage provides historical context, mentioning that the current border with Germany was determined by referendums in 1920.
