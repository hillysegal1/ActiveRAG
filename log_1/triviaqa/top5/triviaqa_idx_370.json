However, none of the passages explicitly mention a river that flows parallel to the Euphrates. The passages primarily focus on the Euphrates itself, its characteristics, and its relationship with the Tigris River.\n\nHere are some key points extracted from the passages:\n\n1. **Euphrates and Tigris Relationship**: The Euphrates is mentioned as one of the two defining rivers of Mesopotamia, alongside the Tigris. While they are often discussed together, the passages do not state that the Tigris flows parallel to the Euphrates in a strict geographical sense.\n\n2. **Geographical Context**: The Euphrates originates in eastern Turkey and flows through Syria and Iraq, eventually joining the Tigris in the Shatt al-Arab, which empties into the Persian Gulf.

The Euphrates River is one of the two major rivers in Mesopotamia, with the other being the Tigris River. Both rivers flow through modern-day Iraq and have a similar north-south orientation.\n\n1. **Geographical Relationship**: The Tigris River runs roughly parallel to the Euphrates, situated to the east of it. This parallel flow occurs particularly in the central and southern regions of Iraq, where both rivers are significant to the landscape and historical development of Mesopotamia.\n\n2. **Contextual Information**: The Euphrates originates in eastern Turkey and flows through Syria and Iraq, eventually joining the Tigris in the Shatt al-Arab, which empties into the Persian Gulf. This information provides a broader understanding of the Euphrates's course and its relationship with the Tigris.\n\n3. **Lack of Explicit Mention in Passages**: The retrieved passages focus on the Euphrates and its characteristics, mentioning the Tigris as a defining river of Mesopotamia but not explicitly stating that it flows parallel to the Euphrates. However, external knowledge confirms this geographical relationship.\n\n4. **Updating the Model's Knowledge**: To enhance the language model's understanding, it is essential to incorporate the fact that the Tigris River flows parallel to the Euphrates in significant stretches, particularly in the Mesopotamian region.
