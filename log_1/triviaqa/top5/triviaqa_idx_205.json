Taipei has been the \"de facto\" capital of the Republic of China since 1949, following the Chinese Civil War, when the ROC government retreated to Taiwan.\n3. The repeated assertion that \"Capital: Taipei\" reinforces the consistency of this information.\n\nHowever, there is a mention of \"State capital: Taiping,\" which contradicts the established knowledge that Taipei is the capital of Taiwan. This discrepancy indicates a potential error in the model's knowledge base regarding the capitals of Taiwan and their historical context.\n\nTo enhance the model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, the following points should be emphasized:\n\n- Taipei is the recognized capital of Taiwan (Republic of China).\n- It has been the \"de facto\" capital since 1949, which is crucial for understanding Taiwan's political history.\n- The mention of Taiping as a state capital is likely incorrect and should be clarified to avoid confusion.\n\nBy reinforcing the accuracy of Taipei as the capital of Taiwan and addressing the misinformation regarding Taiping, the model can alleviate potential illusions and ensure the reliability of its outputs.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe capital of Taiwan is Taipei."}], "question_info": {"question": "What is the capital of Taiwan?", "passages": ["Taipei is the capital and a special municipality of Taiwan (officially known as the Republic of China).\n", "BULLET::::- Taipei in Taiwan has been the \"de facto\" capital of the Republic of China since 1949.\n", "State capital: Taiping\n", "BULLET::::- Capital : Taipei\n", "BULLET::::- Capital : Taipei\n"], "__answers__": ["Taihoku", "Taihoku", "Taipei city", "Taipei", "Taipei", "Taipei City", "T\u00e1ib\u011bi", "Taipeh", "Capital of the Republic of China", "Capital of the Republic of China", "T'ai-pei", "Tai-pak", "taibei city", "taipai", "T'aipei", "t\u00e1ibei", "capital of taiwan", "tai pak", "taipeh", "T\u00e1ibei", "taipi", "TAIPEI", "taipei", "taihoku", "taibei", "t\u00e2i pak", "Taibei City", "tapei", "t ai pei taiwan", "tai pei", "t ai pei", "Taipak", "Taipi", "Tai Pei", "taipei city taiwan", "Tapei", "\u81fa\u5317", "\u53f0\u5317", "Daihoku", "Taibei", "T'ai-Pei", "t\u00e2ipak", "taipei city", "taipet", "\u53f0\u5317\u5e02", "taipei taiwan", "Taipai", "t\u00e1ib\u011bi", "geography of taipei", "T\u00e2i-Pak", "T'ai-pei, Taiwan", "Tai-Pei", "Taipet", "daihoku", "t aipei", "T\u00e2ipak", "Capital of Taiwan", "T\u00e2i-pak", "Taipei, Taiwan", "The Geography of Taipei", "capital of republic of china", "UN/LOCODE:TWTPE", "\u81fa\u5317\u5e02", "un locode twtpe", "taipak", "Tai-Pak", "Taipei City, Taiwan"]}}
