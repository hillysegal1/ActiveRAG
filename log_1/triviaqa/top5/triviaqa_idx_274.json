This would allow the model to make direct inferences about the number of unique individuals who won gold medals in the men's singles event during that time frame.\nPlease verify the above reasoning process for errors, \nthen enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to enhance the causal reasoning and logical inference abilities.\nAfterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n\nGeneration Format:\nknowledge enhanced inference process:\nAnswer:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Knowledge Enhanced Inference Process:\n\n1. **Introduction of Badminton**: Badminton was introduced as an official Olympic sport at the 1992 Summer Olympics.
