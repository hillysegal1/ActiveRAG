To determine which island it is located on, we need to consider the geography of Japan. Japan consists of four main islands: Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku. Mount Fuji is situated near Tokyo and Yokohama, which are both located on the island of Honshu.

Japan consists of four main islands: Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku. \n\n1. **Geographical Location:** \n   - Mount Fuji is situated near Tokyo and Yokohama, both of which are located on Honshu. The passages confirm that Mount Fuji straddles the boundary of Shizuoka and Yamanashi Prefectures, reinforcing its location on Honshu.\n\n2. **Cultural References:**\n   - The passages indicate that while \"Fujiyama\" is a term used, the mountain is more commonly referred to as \"Fujisan\" in Japanese culture. This distinction is important for understanding local nomenclature and cultural significance.\n\n3. **Additional Context:**\n   - The passages provide details about Mount Fuji's geographical features, such as its proximity to the Pacific coast of central Honshu and its surrounding lakes and cities. This context enhances the understanding of Mount Fuji not just as a geographical landmark but also as a cultural symbol.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The information retrieved from the passages does not contradict the existing knowledge about Mount Fuji's location.
