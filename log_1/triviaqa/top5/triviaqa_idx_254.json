Kansas voted to repeal its prohibition law on November 8, 1948, thus officially ending 68 years of prohibition in that state.\n\n5. **Confirmation of the State**: Based on historical records, Kansas is confirmed to be the state that ended its prohibition law in November 1948, making it the correct answer to the question.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe reasoning process has been enhanced by clearly outlining the historical context of prohibition laws, the specific timeline of Kansas's prohibition, and the confirmation of the repeal date.
