Recognizing these connections allows for a deeper understanding of how gurdwaras function as repositories of cultural memory and heritage.\n\n4. **Terminology Recognition**: The fact that a gurdwara can also be referred to as a Sikh temple indicates a broader understanding of religious terminology. This recognition helps in making logical inferences about the nature of religious spaces across different cultures and religions.\n\n5. **Community Dynamics**: The passages emphasize that gurdwaras are more than just places of worship; they are vital to the social fabric of the Sikh community.
