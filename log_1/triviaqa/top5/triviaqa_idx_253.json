The three primary formats are Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is). Test matches are the longest format, ODIs are limited-overs matches with 50 overs per side, and T20Is are even shorter, with each team playing 20 overs. \n\nSince the question asks for the third main international competition alongside Test matches and ODIs, we conclude that the third format is T20Is.\n\nAnswer:\nTwenty20 Internationals (T20Is)\nTo update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions. \nI retrieved some knowledge that may update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions\nNote that these passages are retrieved from the most authoritative knowledge repositories, so they are assumed to be correct.\nknowledge:\nBased on the provided passages, the main international cricket competitions mentioned are Test matches, One-Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 matches (T20s).

The three primary formats are Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is). \n\n1. **Test Matches**: This is the longest format of the game, where teams play over five days, with each team having two innings.\n2. **One Day Internationals (ODIs)**: These are limited-overs matches where each team plays a maximum of 50 overs.\n3. **Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is)**: This is the shortest format, where each team plays a maximum of 20 overs.\n\nThe question specifically asks for the third main international competition alongside Test matches and ODIs. Based on the retrieved passages, we confirm that the third format is indeed T20Is. \n\n- **Passage 4** states: \"International cricket matches are played between teams representing their nations, normally organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The main forms are Test matches, One-Day matches and Twenty20 matches.\" This passage explicitly identifies the three main forms of international cricket.\n  \n- **Passage 1** discusses the transition to the T20 format, emphasizing its significance in international cricket: \"the format was switched to Twenty20 International (T20I) format for the first time in the 2017-18 season with Australia, New Zealand and England competing.\"\n\nBy integrating this information, we can confidently conclude that the three main formats of international cricket are Test matches, ODIs, and T20Is.
