It can also help in distributing the rider's weight more evenly.\n\n3. **Flap**: The flap is the part of the saddle that hangs down on the side, typically where the rider's leg rests. It is crucial for the rider's comfort and aids in leg positioning.\n\n4. **Pommel**: The pommel is the front part of the saddle that rises above the seat.
