Craignure is a village located on the Isle of Mull in Scotland. The railway in question is known for connecting Craignure to Torosay Castle, which is also situated on the Isle of Mull. \n\nBoth locations being on the same island allows us to conclude that the narrow gauge railway operates entirely within the boundaries of the Isle of Mull. However, it is important to note that the Isle of Mull Railway, which connected these two points, closed in 2011. This closure is a significant detail that may not be reflected in the model's existing knowledge, especially if it implies that the railway is still operational.\n\nAdditionally, the railway was established to facilitate tourism, as suggested by local businessman Graham Ellis, who envisioned it as a means to transport visitors to Torosay Castle.

This information is crucial for accurately representing the current status of the railway.\n\nIn summary, while the narrow gauge railway operated on the Isle of Mull, it is no longer in service, having closed in 2011.
