The children of an \"Infante\" or \"Infanta\" have the rank (but not the title) of Grandees, and the style of \"His or Her Excellency\".\\n', 'In the Spanish royal family, the dynastic children of the monarch and of the heir apparent are entitled to the designation and rank of \"infante\" with the style of Royal Highness (\"infantes by birth\"). A second category of \"infantes\" may be granted that title by royal decree (\"infantes by grace\"), but only bear the style of Highness. Previously, the title and rank of \"infante of Spain\" was often granted to relatives and in-laws of Spain\\'s monarchs, but unlike those created under the 1987 decree, their dynastic wives were automatically \"infantas\" and bearers of the title were \"Royal Highnesses\".\\n', 'The Spanish title, with the accompanying dignity of Grandee of Spain, follows the inheritance rules of that country. Spanish noble titles historically have followed the rule of male-preference primogeniture, which allows a female to succeed if she has no living brothers and no deceased brothers who left surviving legitimate descendants. With the death of the 10th Duke of Berwick in September 1953, his only child, Do\u00f1a Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart, 18th Duchess of Alba, succeeded him in his Spanish titles, including the Spanish dukedom of Berwick.

The Infanta was the daughter of Philip III of Spain. As Spanish succession laws did not prevent a female from ascending the throne, she was the heiress presumptive to the throne. Likewise, her offspring would have a legitimate, if not strong, claim to the Spanish throne. Thus, before her marriage, she was made to renounce all succession rights she had had for herself and her descendants by Louis.\\n', 'As with other Spanish noble titles, the dukedom of Segorbe descended according to cognatic primogeniture, meaning that females could inherit the title if they had no brothers (or if their brothers had no issue). That changed in 2006, since when the eldest child (regardless of gender) can automatically succeed to noble family titles.\\n', 'In May 2016 Prince Carlo unilaterally renounced the agreement and subsequently conferred the titles of Duchess of Calabria and Duchess of Noto on his daughters, declaring the former to be the heiress to the headship of the Royal House and the Constantinian Grand Mastership. This act has not been recognised by members of the branch descended from Prince Gabriel of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. The legality of this has been disputed by Prince Pedro on the grounds that the succession to the Two Sicilies crown was established in two international treaties (Vienna 1737 and Naples 1759) as well as the Pragmatic Decree of 1759 and the nineteenth century Two Sicilies constitutions and therefore could not be changed by a unilateral act, even by an undisputed head of the royal house. The succession to the Constantinian Grand Mastership was confirmed by an Imperial Bull and a Papal Brief, and by the Bull Militantis Ecclesiae, and required that the Grand Mastership, an ecclesiastical office in canon law, could only be held by males and must pass by primogeniture to the heirs of the House of Farnese; the purported change to the succession by Prince Carlo has not been approved by the Holy See.\\n', \"The present king of Spain, Felipe VI, was the first member of the Borbon dynasty in Spain to have borne this title, which he did while heir apparent to the Spanish crown.

This title is used in both Spain and Portugal, reflecting a shared cultural and historical context in their monarchies.

In Spain, the primary heir is referred to as the \"Princess of Asturias.\"\n\n2. **Royal Style**: Infantes and Infantas are styled as \"His Royal Highness\" or \"Her Royal Highness,\" which indicates their elevated status within the royal hierarchy. This distinction is important for understanding their role and recognition in royal ceremonies and functions.\n\n3. **Categories of Infantes**: There are two categories of Infantes:\n   - **Infantes by birth**: These are the legitimate children of the reigning monarch and the heir apparent, automatically receiving the title.\n   - **Infantes by grace**: This category includes individuals who may be granted the title through royal decree, but they do not carry the same royal style as those by birth. This distinction highlights the importance of lineage and royal favor in the assignment of titles.\n\n4. **Historical Context**: The title of Infante was historically extended not only to the monarch's children but also to relatives and in-laws, indicating a broader application of the title. This historical perspective helps us understand the evolving nature of royal titles and their implications for family dynamics within the monarchy.\n\n5. **Succession Rules**: The passages mention that Spanish succession laws historically followed male-preference primogeniture, allowing females to inherit titles under specific conditions. This context is crucial for understanding the dynamics of royal succession and how it affects the distribution of titles among royal family members.\n\n6. **Causal Relationships**: The distinction between Infantes by birth and Infantes by grace illustrates how titles can be granted or inherited, leading to causal reasoning about the implications of royal decrees and the impact of lineage on titles. For instance, a royal decree can change the status of individuals within the royal family, affecting their rights and privileges.\n\n7. **Broader Implications**: Understanding the nuances of royal titles allows for inferences about social structures, governance, and the role of tradition in modern societies.
