The Winter Paralympics are part of a broader movement that began with the Summer Paralympics, which started in 1960. The establishment of the Winter Paralympics came later, reflecting a growing recognition of the need for inclusive sports for athletes with disabilities.\n\n1. **Historical Context**: The first Winter Paralympic Games were held in **1976** in **\u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, Sweden**. This event was significant because it allowed athletes with various disabilities to compete, marking a departure from earlier events that primarily featured wheelchair athletes. This expansion was crucial in promoting inclusivity in sports.\n\n2. **Evolution of the Games**: Since their inception, the Winter Paralympics have evolved significantly. They are held every four years, traditionally in the same year as the Summer Paralympics until 1992, when they began to be held in even-numbered years separately. This change reflects the growing importance and recognition of the Paralympics as a major international sporting event.\n\n3. **Organizational Development**: The formation of the International Co-ordinating Committee (ICC) in 1982 played a pivotal role in organizing the Winter Paralympics and ensuring they were sanctioned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). This organizational backing has been essential for the legitimacy and growth of the Games.\n\n4. **Cultural Significance**: The origins of the Paralympics are rooted in the post-World War II era, where sports were seen as a means of rehabilitation for injured soldiers. This historical backdrop provides insight into the motivations for establishing the Games and highlights the societal changes that have influenced their development.\n\n5. **Causal Relationships**: Understanding that the first Winter Paralympics were established in response to the need for inclusive sports helps clarify the causal relationships between societal changes (such as increased awareness of disability sports) and the establishment of events like the Paralympics. This understanding enhances the model's ability to draw connections between historical events and their outcomes.\n\n6. **Temporal Reasoning**: The scheduling of the Winter Paralympics in relation to the Summer Games allows for the inference of patterns and predictions about future events based on historical timelines. This temporal reasoning is crucial for understanding the evolution of the Games.\n\n7. **Complexity of Events**: The growth and changes in the Winter Paralympics illustrate the complexity of organizing large-scale sporting events. This complexity requires consideration of multiple factors, enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities by fostering a deeper understanding of interrelations among various elements.\n\nBy synthesizing this knowledge, I can confidently conclude that the first Winter Paralympics were a landmark event in the history of sports for athletes with disabilities, reflecting broader societal changes and the evolution of inclusive practices in athletics.\n\n### Answer:\nThe first Winter Paralympics were held in 1976 in \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, Sweden."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nWhen were the first Winter Paralympics held?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The 1984 Winter Paralympic Games (German: \"Paralympische Winterspiele 1984\") were the third Winter Paralympics.

These Games were accessible for all athletes with cerebral palsy. For the first time, an exhibition event was held at the Olympic Winter Games in Sarajevo and 30 male three-track skiers took part in the Giant Slalom event. Three sports were contested: alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, and ice sledge speed racing. The most successful athlete was German alpine skier Reinhild Moeller, who won 3 gold medals and 1 silver medal.
