This educational aspect underscores the work's lasting influence and relevance in the study of classical literature, further solidifying its importance in both historical and academic contexts.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe classical author who wrote the \"Anabasis\" is **Xenophon**. His work provides a detailed account of the journey of the \"Army of the Ten Thousand,\" highlighting both historical events and personal experiences. The distinction between Xenophon\u2019s \"Anabasis\" and Arrian\u2019s work is essential for clarity, as they pertain to different historical narratives.
