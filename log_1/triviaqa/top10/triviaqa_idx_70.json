The phrase \"regular but never seen\" implies that Forsythe's contributions were likely through voice work or narration rather than physical appearances.\n\n1. **Identifying Forsythe's Roles**: John Forsythe is widely recognized for his role as Blake Carrington in the television series \"Dynasty.\" His character was central to the show's plot, and he provided the voice for Blake Carrington throughout the series. However, it is important to note that Forsythe's character was often portrayed through voiceovers, especially in the earlier seasons, where he may not have been physically present in every episode.\n\n2. **Understanding Voice Work in Television**: The model can recognize that voice acting can constitute a \"regular\" role in a series. Forsythe's role as a voice actor means he contributed significantly to the show's narrative and character development without being visually present. This is a common practice in television, where characters may be voiced by actors who do not appear on screen.\n\n3. **Causal Relationships**: Forsythe's voice work as Blake Carrington likely contributed to the show's popularity and success. The model can infer that his presence, even if not seen, was a crucial element in establishing the character's persona and the overall tone of the series.\n\n4. **Logical Inference**: The model can enhance its reasoning by recognizing that a character's impact on a series does not solely depend on physical presence.
