The ovary contains follicles, which are fluid-filled sacs that house immature eggs (oocytes). Typically, one follicle matures each month and releases an egg. \n\nOnce the egg is released, the remaining structure of the follicle transforms into the corpus luteum. This structure is crucial as it produces hormones, primarily progesterone, which are essential for maintaining the uterine lining (endometrium) in preparation for a potential pregnancy. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates after about 12\u201314 days, leading to a decrease in progesterone levels. This hormonal drop triggers the shedding of the uterine lining and the unfertilized egg during menstruation.\n\nAdditionally, the egg itself, if not fertilized, disintegrates or dissolves in the fallopian tube. The entire process is regulated by hormonal signals from the pituitary gland, which orchestrates the timing of ovulation and the subsequent changes in the reproductive system.\n\nUnderstanding these processes allows us to infer that the release of the egg is not an isolated event; it is part of a cyclical process that involves the transformation of ovarian structures and the preparation of the uterus for potential implantation. The model can thus recognize that if an egg is released and not fertilized, it leads to specific physiological outcomes, including the degeneration of the corpus luteum and the onset of menstruation.\n\n### Answer:\nThe corpus luteum is left behind in the ovary after the egg is released.
