It was built by the Nabataeans as their capital city around 100 BC and is renowned for its rock-cut architecture and historical significance as a major trading hub along the Incense Route. Petra was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985."}], "question_info": {"question": "Where is Petra, an archaeological site with rock-cut architecture and designated a World Heritage Site 1985, that was built by the Nabataeans as their capital city around 100 BC?", "passages": ["Petra is the Nabataean kingdom capital's archeological site, carved in the desert rock of (Trans)Jordan.\n", "Petra (from the Greek \"petra\", meaning 'of rock') lies in the Jordan Rift Valley, east of Wadi `Araba in Jordan about south of the Dead Sea. It came into prominence in the late 1st century BCE through the success of the spice trade. The city was the principal city of ancient Nabataea and was famous above all for two things: its trade and its hydraulic engineering systems. It was locally autonomous until the reign of Trajan, but it flourished under Roman rule. The town grew up around its Colonnaded Street in the 1st century and by the middle of the 1st century had witnessed rapid urbanization. The quarries were probably opened in this period, and there followed virtually continuous building through the 1st and 2nd centuries CE.\n", "The architecture of Petra is the most recognisable from Jordan due to its popularity among tourists. Petra was a city that was at the centre of trade between the Middle East and the Roman Empire. It was a city of ingenuity and wealth. The original settlements in Petra were constructed of rough stones and clay. The designs were simple and were likely used for travellers to store items. Once the population in Petra began to grow, the infrastructure such as tombs and monuments incorporated the designs of their trading partners. Their architectural style was Nabataean, incorporating the influences of Assyrian, Egyptian, Hellenistic and Roman civilisations. The rock-cut facades are the most iconic monuments in Petra.\n", "Petra (; , \"Stone\"), originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu, is a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan. Petra lies on the slope of Jabal Al-Madbah in a basin among the mountains which form the eastern flank of the Arabah valley that runs from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. Petra is believed to have been settled as early as 9,000\u00a0BC, and it was possibly established in the 4th century BC as the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.\n", "The remains of the Nabataean civilisation in Petra stands as a prime example of ancient Eastern traditions meeting Hellenistic architecture.\n", "The land of the Governorate of Ma'an hosts many historic sites. The land of Ma'an Governorate was under the Edomite rule, which had its capital in Busaira in neighboring Tafilah Governorate. The Edomites were then replaced by the Nabateans who built one of the most significant archaeological and historical sites in the Middle East, the ancient city of Petra. After succeeding in repulsing Macedonian and Roman invasions, Petra finally fell to the Roman Empire in 103 A.D. Near Petra is Mount Hor, where is it believed that Aaron the brother of Moses died: the mountain is referred to as \"Jebel Nebi Harun \" (Mountain of Prophet Aaron) in Arabic. There is a tomb for Aaron at the top of the mountain.\n", "The Nabataeans in their city of Petra, now in Jordan, extended the Western Asian tradition, carving their temples and tombs into the yellowish-orange rock that defines the canyons and gullies of the region. These structures, dating from 1st century BCE to about 2nd century CE, are particularly important in the history of architecture given their experimental forms. Here too, because the structures served as tombs, the interiors were rather perfunctory. In Petra one even finds a theater where the seats are cut out of the rock.\n", "Like Petra, it was probably built during the height of Nabataean influence during the 1st century C.E. While the purpose of some of the buildings is not clear, archaeologists believe that the whole complex was a suburb of Petra, the Nabatean capital, meant to house visiting traders on the Silk Road. After the decline of the Nabataeans, it fell vacant, used only by Bedouin nomads, for centuries. Along with neighboring Beidha, Little Petra was excavated in the later 20th century by Diana Kirkbride and Brian Byrd.\n", "BULLET::::- Petra in Wadi Musa, home of the Nabateans, is a complete city carved in a mountain. The huge rocks are colorful, mostly pink, and the entrance to the ancient city is through a 1.25\u00a0km narrow gorge in the mountain\u2014called the Siq. In the city are various structures, all (except 2) are carved into rock, including al Khazneh\u00a0\u2013 known as the Treasury\u00a0\u2013 which has been designated as one of the \"New Seven Wonders of the World\" by the for-profit New Open World Corporation. Other major sites of interest in Petra include the Monastery, the Roman theater, the Royal Tombs, the High Place of Sacrifice. Petra was rediscovered for the Western world by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in 1812. It was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985.\n", "The Nabateans built Petra, which stood halfway between the opening to the Gulf of Akaba and the Dead Sea at a point where the Incense Route from Arabia to Damascus was crossed by the overland route from Petra to Gaza. This position gave the Nabateans a hold over the trade along the Incense Route. In order to control the Incense Route from the Nabatean a Greek military expedition lead by Swan was undertaken, without success, by Antigonus Cyclops, one of Alexander of Macedonia's generals. The Nabatean control over trade increased and spread to the West and the North. The replacement of Greece by the Roman empire as the administrator of the Mediterranean basin led to the resumption of direct trade with the east. According to a historian \"The South Arabs in protest took to pirate attacks over the Roman ships in the Gulf of Aden. In response, the Romans destroyed Aden and favoured the Western Abyssinian coast of the Red Sea.\" The monopoly of the Indian and Arab middlemen weakened with the development of monsoon trade by the Greeks through the discovery of the direct route to India (Hippalus), forcing the Parthian and Arabian middlemen to adjust their prices so as to compete on the Roman market with the goods now being bought in by a direct sea route to India. Indian ships sailed to Egypt as the maritime routes of Southern Asia were not under the control of a single power.\n"], "__answers__": ["Jordan", "Jordan", "Jordan", "Al-Urdunn", "al urdunn", "jordan", "Urdun", "jordan country", "al mamlakah al", "Languages of Jordan", "Kingdom of Jordan", "\u0623\u0631\u062f\u0646\u0651", "h k of jordan", "Al-Mamlakah al", "Administrative divisions of Jordan", "Al-'Urdun", "Jordanian Kingdom", "JOrdan", "Kingdom of the Jordan", "urdunn", "HKJ", "iso 3166 1 jo", "ottoman jordon", "al urdun", "Hashemite Kingdom of the Jordan", "administrative divisions of jordan", "Jordanie", "The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan", "H.K of Jordan", "hashemite kingdom of jordan", "hashemite kingdom of transjordan", "hkj", "Etymology of Jordan", "Al-Urdun", "jordanie", "etymology of jordan", "languages of jordan", "Jordan (country)", "jordanian kingdom", "urdun", "Urdunn", "kingdom of jordan", "state of jordan", "Ottoman Jordon", "Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan", "\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u062f\u0646\u0651\u064a\u0651\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0627\u0634\u0645\u064a\u0651\u0629", "\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u062f\u0646", "State of Jordan", "ISO 3166-1:JO", "Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan"]}}
