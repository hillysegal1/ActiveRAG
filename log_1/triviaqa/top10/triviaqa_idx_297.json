Paddle crabs have a hard shell, or carapace and ten legs, five to each side. The first set of legs of the crab is tipped with large claws. The claws of the paddle crab are fairly long and narrow and are curled in a sickle shape. They are decapods which means they have 10 legs and are situated symmetrically with five legs on each side. The claws are also serrated with large points on the insides. The carapace, or shell, of the crab can range from pale orange to light gray, and can be spotted with brown and red. The carapace is a rough oval shape, and the front end has five teeth to either side of the eyes. Paddle crabs can reach sizes ranging from 100\u2013140\\xa0mm across the shell upon reaching maturity. Unlike some other crab species, the last pair of legs of this crab is flattened into a paddle, hence their name. These paddles are also colored blue, and sometimes have a purple tinge, making them distinctive in color from the rest of the body. Unlike prawns and lobsters which have narrow bodies with long tails, paddle crabs have also developed a wide body (carapace) and very short tail (abdomen), which is usually tucked underneath to its body making it compact and wide.\\n', 'The body of the coconut crab is, like that of all decapods, divided into a front section (cephalothorax), which has 10 legs, and an abdomen. The front-most pair of legs has large chelae (claws), with the left being larger than the right. The next two pairs, as with other hermit crabs, are large, powerful walking legs with pointed tips, which allow coconut crabs to climb vertical or overhanging surfaces. The fourth pair of legs is smaller with tweezer-like chelae at the end, allowing young coconut crabs to grip the inside of a shell or coconut husk to carry for protection; adults use this pair for walking and climbing. The last pair of legs is very small and is used by females to tend their eggs, and by the males in mating. This last pair of legs is usually held inside the carapace, in the cavity containing the breathing organs. Some difference in color occurs between the animals found on different islands, ranging from orange-red to purplish blue; in most regions, blue is the predominant color, but in some places, including the Seychelles, most individuals are red.\\n', 'Like other members of the family, these crabs are easily recognizable due to the complete absence of the last pair of walking legs (pereiopods).
