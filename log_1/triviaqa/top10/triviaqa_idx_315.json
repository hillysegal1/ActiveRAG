This is noted as the highest known point value for any letter in any Scrabble score distribution worldwide.\n   - In standard Scrabble scoring, 'K' is typically worth 5 points, which is a common value across various editions of the game.\n\n2. **Rarity of 'K':**\n   - The letter 'K' is described as being rare in Latin and is used primarily in borrowed words. This rarity contributes to its high point value in games like Scrabble.\n\n3. **Comparison with Other Letters:**\n   - The passages mention that other high-scoring letters include 'Q' and 'Z' (each worth 10 points), and 'X' and 'J' (each worth 8 points). This establishes a hierarchy of letter values based on their frequency and usage in the language.\n\n4. **Game Variants:**\n   - Different versions of Scrabble may assign different values to letters based on linguistic considerations.

This reflects its frequency of use in the English language, where it is less common compared to other letters.\n\n2. **Contextual Variability:**\n   - The passages indicate that when a blank tile is used to represent 'K', it can be valued at 20 points. This is an exceptional case that highlights how the value can change based on the context of the game. The high point value for 'K' when represented by a blank tile is the highest known for any letter in Scrabble, emphasizing its rarity and the strategic value it can provide in gameplay.\n\n3. **Rarity and Usage:**\n   - The letter 'K' is noted to be rare in Latin and primarily appears in borrowed words. This rarity contributes to its higher point value in certain contexts, as letters that are less frequently used tend to have higher scores in word games like Scrabble.\n\n4. **Comparison with Other Letters:**\n   - The letter 'K' is part of a hierarchy of letter values in Scrabble, where letters like 'Q' and 'Z' are valued at 10 points, and 'X' and 'J' at 8 points. Understanding this hierarchy helps in evaluating the relative value of 'K' compared to other letters.\n\n5. **Game Variants:**\n   - Different versions of Scrabble may assign different values to letters based on linguistic considerations. For instance, the Dutch version assigns a value of 8 to 'Y', indicating that the value of letters can vary significantly across different languages and editions of the game.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy synthesizing this information, we can conclude that the standard value of 'K' in Scrabble is 5 points. However, in specific contexts, such as when using a blank tile, its value can rise to 20 points, reflecting its strategic importance in gameplay. This understanding enhances the model's ability to reason about how context, rarity, and hierarchical structures influence value assignments in various systems.\n\n### Answer:\nThe value of the letter 'K' in the game of Scrabble is 5 points.
