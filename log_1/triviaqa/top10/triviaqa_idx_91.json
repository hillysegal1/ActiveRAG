His role as the sole writer indicates a strong, cohesive vision for the show, which is crucial for maintaining narrative consistency.\n\n2. **Production Timeline**: The series ran from 2010 to 2015. Understanding this timeline allows us to consider the historical context in which the series was produced and how it may have influenced the writing. For instance, the events of the early 20th century, including World War I, are significant to the plot and character development.\n\n3. **Film Continuation**: The film \"Downton Abbey: The Movie,\" also written by Julian Fellowes, serves as a continuation of the television series. This connection reinforces Fellowes' integral role in shaping the narrative across different formats, suggesting that the themes and character arcs established in the series were thoughtfully carried over into the film.\n\n4. **Collaboration**: The series was co-produced by Carnival Films and Masterpiece for ITV and PBS. While Fellowes is the key writer, this collaboration may have influenced the production aspects and possibly the narrative direction, indicating that multiple stakeholders contributed to the show's overall success.\n\n5. **Character Development**: The series features a diverse cast of characters, which Fellowes developed through his writing. This complexity in character development is essential for engaging storytelling and can be analyzed to understand how character arcs contribute to the series' acclaim.\n\n6. **Causal Relationships**: By establishing that Julian Fellowes is the primary writer, we can infer the causal relationship between his creative decisions and the show's success. Changes in writing style, character arcs, and plot developments can significantly affect audience reception and critical acclaim.\n\n7. **Temporal Context and Historical Influence**: The timeline of the series allows for reasoning about how historical events influenced the narrative. For example, the impact of World War I on British society is reflected in the characters' lives and decisions, providing depth to the storytelling.\n\n8. **Cross-Media Adaptation**: The transition from a television series to a film allows for analysis of how narratives adapt across different media. The model can infer that successful elements from the series were retained or adapted in the film, which can lead to discussions about narrative consistency and audience expectations.\n\n9. **Collaborative Dynamics**: Recognizing the collaborative nature of the production helps the model understand how different perspectives can shape a creative project. This understanding can extend to analyzing how various stakeholders influence narrative outcomes.\n\n### Answer:\nJulian Fellowes writes the scripts for the TV series \"Downton Abbey.\" His role as the creator and primary writer significantly shaped the narrative and character development throughout the series, which aired from 2010 to 2015.
