As result of sudden attack on Port Arthur, two Russian battleships were seriosly damaged by Tropedoes. This attack developed into a full-scale battle known as Siege of Port Arthur the next morning.

Makarov on April 13, 1904.\\n', 'On the night of 8 February 1904, the Japanese naval fleet under Admiral Heihachiro Togo opened the war with a surprise attack by torpedo boat destroyers on the Russian ships at Port Arthur, badly damaging two Russian battleships.

A series of indecisive naval engagements followed, in which the Japanese were unable to attack the Russian fleet successfully under shore batteries (\"coastal guns\") of the harbor and the Russians declined to leave the harbor for the open seas, especially after the death of Admiral Stepan Osipovich Makarov on 13 April 1904.\\n', 'On the night of 8 February 1904, the Japanese fleet under Admiral T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d opened the war with a surprise torpedo boat destroyer attack on the Russian ships at Port Arthur. The attack heavily damaged the \"Tsesarevich\" and \"Retvizan\", the heaviest battleships in Russia\\'s far Eastern theater, and the 6,600\\xa0ton cruiser \"Pallada\". These attacks developed into the Battle of Port Arthur the next morning. A series of indecisive naval engagements followed, in which Admiral T\u014dg\u014d was unable to attack the Russian fleet successfully as it was protected by the shore batteries of the harbour, and the Russians were reluctant to leave the harbour for the open seas, especially after the death of Admiral Stepan Osipovich Makarov on 13 April 1904. Although the actual Battle of Port Arthur was indecisive, the initial attacks had a devastating psychological effect on Russia, which had been confident about the prospect of war. The Japanese had seized the initiative while the Russians waited in port.\\n', 'At about 22:30 on Monday 8 February 1904, the Port Arthur attack squadron of 10 destroyers encountered patrolling Russian destroyers. The Russians were under orders not to initiate combat, and turned to report the contact to headquarters. However, as a result of the encounter, two Japanese destroyers collided and fell behind and the remainder became scattered. At circa 00:28 on 9 February, the first four Japanese destroyers approached the port of Port Arthur without being observed, and launched a torpedo attack against the \"Pallada\" (which was hit amidship, caught fire, and keeled over) and the \"Retvizan\" (which was holed in her bow). The other Japanese destroyers were less successful; many of the torpedoes became caught in the extended torpedo nets which effectively prevented most of the torpedoes from striking the vitals of the Russian battleships. Other destroyers had arrived too late to benefit from surprise, and made their attacks individually rather than in a group. However, they were able to disable the most powerful ship of the Russian fleet, the battleship \"Tsesarevich\". The Japanese destroyer \"Oboro\" made the last attack, around 02:00, by which time the Russians were fully awake, and their searchlights and gunfire made accurate and close range torpedo attacks impossible.\\n', 'On Tuesday 8 March 1904, Russian Admiral Stepan Makarov arrived in Port Arthur to assume command from the unfortunate Admiral Stark, thus raising Russian morale. He raised his flag on the newly repaired \"Askold\". On the morning of Thursday 10 March 1904, the Russian fleet took to the offensive, and attacked the blockading Japanese squadron, but to little effect. In the evening of 10 March 1904, the Japanese attempted a ruse by sending four destroyers close to the harbor. The Russians took the bait, and sent out six destroyers in pursuit; whereupon the Japanese mined the entrance to the harbor and moved into position to block the destroyers\\' return. Two of the Russian destroyers were sunk, despite efforts by Admiral Makarov to come to their rescue.\\n', 'The Russian fleet attempted to break out from Port Arthur and proceed to Vladivostok, but they were intercepted and dispersed at the Battle of the Yellow Sea. The remnant of the Russian fleet remained in Port Arthur, where the ships were slowly sunk by the artillery of the besieging army. Attempts to relieve the city by land also failed, and after the Battle of Liaoyang in late August, the Russians retreated to Mukden (Shenyang). Port Arthur finally fell on 2 January 1905, after a series of brutal, high-casualty assaults.\\n', 'At 10:30 on December 5, following another massive artillery bombardment, the Japanese managed to overrun 203 Meter Hill overlooking the harbour of Port Arthur with the Russian Pacific Fleet at anchor. They sent an artillery observer on the hill, directing the fire of the 28\\xa0cm howitzer, systematically sinking the Russian fleet, one ship after another. On December 5, 1904, the battleship \"Poltava\" was sunk, followed by the battleship \"Retvizan\" on December 7, 1904, the battleships \"Pobeda\" and \"Peresvet\" and the cruisers \"Pallada\" and \"Bayan\" on December 9, 1904. All six would be raised, repaired, renamed, and recommissioned by the Japanese after the war. The battleship \"Sevastopol\", although hit five times by shells, managed to move out of range of the guns. On the night of January 2, 1905, after Port Arthur surrendered, Captain Nikolai Essen of the \"Sevastopol\" had the crippled battleship scuttled in of water by opening the sea cocks on one side, so that the ship would sink on its side and could not be raised and salvaged by the Japanese.\\n', 'During the Russo-Japanese War the Japanese Third Army was besieging Port Arthur. While the capture of Port Arthur had been achieved in a single assault during the First Sino-Japanese War the situation was different in 1904. The Russians had been in possession of Port Arthur since 1897 and had constructed strong fortifications around the city following the plans of General Eduard Totleben. After the first general assault in August 1904 and over 16,000 casualties General Nogi, the commanding officer of the Japanese forces, requested heavy siege guns. With the arrival of the first battery of 28\\xa0cm howitzers, replacing those lost when the transport \"Hitachi Maru\", loaded with a battalion of the First Reserve Regiment of the Guards, was sunk by Russian cruisers in the Hitachi Maru Incident on June 15, 1904, the situation changed. The massive, 11-inch, howitzers could throw a 217\\xa0kilogram (478\\xa0pound) shell over 7.8 kilometers (4.8\\xa0miles), and Nogi then had the firepower necessary to make a serious attempt against the Russian fortifications. The huge shells were nicknamed \"roaring trains\" by the Russian troops (for the sound they made just before impact), and during their period at Port Arthur over 16,949 of these shells were fired.\\n', 'When the Russo-Japanese War broke out in 1904, \"Rurik\" and the other cruisers of the Pacific Squadron, , , and , were all charged with seeking out and destroying Japanese merchant vessels in the Sea of Japan and along the coasts of the Japanese home islands.

The siege of Port Arthur kept most of the Russian naval vessels assigned to the Pacific Squadron inside the port, despite several failed attempts at breakout.\\n', 'During the war the bulk of the Russian Pacific Fleet was located in Port Arthur where they were blockaded by the Japanese. On 10 August 1904 the ships at Port Arthur attempted breakout to Vladivostok, but were turned back in the Battle of the Yellow Sea.

This surprise attack involved torpedo boat destroyers targeting Russian ships at Port Arthur, resulting in significant damage to two Russian battleships, the \"Tsesarevich\" and \"Retvizan\" (Passages 1, 2, 3).\n\n2. **Battle of Port Arthur**:\n   - The initial attacks led to the development of the Battle of Port Arthur, which began the following morning. Despite several engagements, the Japanese Navy faced challenges due to the Russian fleet's strong defensive position and coastal artillery (Passages 1, 2, 3).\n\n3. **Psychological Impact**:\n   - The early attacks had a profound psychological effect on the Russian forces, undermining their confidence and allowing the Japanese to seize the initiative in the conflict (Passage 3).\n\n4. **Siege and Subsequent Actions**:\n   - Following the initial attacks, the Japanese Navy continued to besiege Port Arthur, which was fortified by the Russians. The siege lasted until January 2, 1905, when Port Arthur finally fell after a series of brutal assaults and artillery bombardments (Passages 6, 8).\n\n5. **Destruction of the Russian Fleet**:\n   - The Japanese forces systematically sank the remaining Russian ships in Port Arthur through artillery bombardment. This culminated in the sinking of several battleships and cruisers, including the \"Poltava,\" \"Retvizan,\" and \"Pallada,\" among others, during the siege (Passages 6, 7).\n\n### Contextual Relationships:\n\n- The context of the Russo-Japanese War is crucial to understanding the significance of the Japanese Navy's actions.

This conflict arose from competing imperial ambitions in East Asia, particularly over territories in Manchuria and Korea, and marked a significant shift in the balance of power in the region.\n\n1. **Initial Engagements**:\n   - The Japanese Navy, commanded by Admiral T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d, launched a surprise attack on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur on February 8, 1904. This initial assault involved torpedo boat destroyers and resulted in substantial damage to key Russian battleships, notably the \"Tsesarevich\" and \"Retvizan.\" This event is critical as it not only marked the beginning of hostilities but also demonstrated Japan's naval capabilities (Passages 1, 2, 3).\n\n2. **Battle Dynamics**:\n   - Following the initial attack, the situation escalated into the Battle of Port Arthur, which saw a series of naval engagements. Despite the Japanese Navy's efforts, they faced difficulties due to the Russian fleet's strong defensive position and the effective coastal artillery protecting Port Arthur (Passages 1, 2, 3). This context highlights the strategic challenges both sides faced during the conflict.\n\n3. **Psychological Warfare**:\n   - The psychological impact of the Japanese attacks on the Russian forces was significant. The early losses undermined Russian morale and confidence, allowing the Japanese to maintain the initiative throughout the war (Passage 3). Understanding this psychological aspect provides insight into the broader implications of naval warfare beyond mere physical confrontations.\n\n4. **Siege and Final Destruction**:\n   - The siege of Port Arthur continued until January 2, 1905, culminating in the systematic destruction of the Russian fleet. The Japanese forces employed heavy artillery bombardments, leading to the sinking of several Russian ships, including the \"Poltava,\" \"Retvizan,\" and \"Pallada\" (Passages 6, 7). This phase of the conflict illustrates the effectiveness of the Japanese strategy and their ability to capitalize on their initial successes.\n\n5. **Broader Implications**:\n   - The events at Port Arthur were pivotal in the context of the Russo-Japanese War and had lasting implications for international relations in the region. Japan's victory marked its emergence as a major military power and signaled a shift in the dynamics of imperialism in East Asia.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe navy that destroyed the Russian fleet at Port Arthur after a series of attacks in 1904 and 1905 was the **Japanese Navy**. The conflict began with a surprise attack on February 8, 1904, led by Admiral T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d, and culminated in a prolonged siege that resulted in the sinking of multiple Russian battleships and cruisers. This series of military engagements not only showcased Japan's naval prowess but also significantly altered the balance of power in East Asia during the early 20th century.\n\n### Answer:\nJapan"}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nThe navy from which country destroyed the Russian fleet at Port Arthur after a number of attacks in 1904 and 1905?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['On the night of February 8, 1904 the Japanese Navy under the command of T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d began military operations against the Russian Empire. As result of sudden attack on Port Arthur, two Russian battleships were seriosly damaged by Tropedoes. This attack developed into a full-scale battle known as Siege of Port Arthur the next morning. Several attempts by Japanese Navy to attack Russian fleets were failed due to coastal artillery fire and the reluctance of the Russian fleet to leave the harbor for battle on the high seas, especially after the death of Admiral S. Makarov on April 13, 1904.\\n', 'On the night of 8 February 1904, the Japanese naval fleet under Admiral Heihachiro Togo opened the war with a surprise attack by torpedo boat destroyers on the Russian ships at Port Arthur, badly damaging two Russian battleships. The attacks developed into the Battle of Port Arthur the next morning. A series of indecisive naval engagements followed, in which the Japanese were unable to attack the Russian fleet successfully under shore batteries (\"coastal guns\") of the harbor and the Russians declined to leave the harbor for the open seas, especially after the death of Admiral Stepan Osipovich Makarov on 13 April 1904.\\n', 'On the night of 8 February 1904, the Japanese fleet under Admiral T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d opened the war with a surprise torpedo boat destroyer attack on the Russian ships at Port Arthur. The attack heavily damaged the \"Tsesarevich\" and \"Retvizan\", the heaviest battleships in Russia\\'s far Eastern theater, and the 6,600\\xa0ton cruiser \"Pallada\". These attacks developed into the Battle of Port Arthur the next morning. A series of indecisive naval engagements followed, in which Admiral T\u014dg\u014d was unable to attack the Russian fleet successfully as it was protected by the shore batteries of the harbour, and the Russians were reluctant to leave the harbour for the open seas, especially after the death of Admiral Stepan Osipovich Makarov on 13 April 1904. Although the actual Battle of Port Arthur was indecisive, the initial attacks had a devastating psychological effect on Russia, which had been confident about the prospect of war. The Japanese had seized the initiative while the Russians waited in port.\\n', 'At about 22:30 on Monday 8 February 1904, the Port Arthur attack squadron of 10 destroyers encountered patrolling Russian destroyers. The Russians were under orders not to initiate combat, and turned to report the contact to headquarters. However, as a result of the encounter, two Japanese destroyers collided and fell behind and the remainder became scattered. At circa 00:28 on 9 February, the first four Japanese destroyers approached the port of Port Arthur without being observed, and launched a torpedo attack against the \"Pallada\" (which was hit amidship, caught fire, and keeled over) and the \"Retvizan\" (which was holed in her bow). The other Japanese destroyers were less successful; many of the torpedoes became caught in the extended torpedo nets which effectively prevented most of the torpedoes from striking the vitals of the Russian battleships. Other destroyers had arrived too late to benefit from surprise, and made their attacks individually rather than in a group. However, they were able to disable the most powerful ship of the Russian fleet, the battleship \"Tsesarevich\". The Japanese destroyer \"Oboro\" made the last attack, around 02:00, by which time the Russians were fully awake, and their searchlights and gunfire made accurate and close range torpedo attacks impossible.\\n', 'On Tuesday 8 March 1904, Russian Admiral Stepan Makarov arrived in Port Arthur to assume command from the unfortunate Admiral Stark, thus raising Russian morale. He raised his flag on the newly repaired \"Askold\". On the morning of Thursday 10 March 1904, the Russian fleet took to the offensive, and attacked the blockading Japanese squadron, but to little effect. In the evening of 10 March 1904, the Japanese attempted a ruse by sending four destroyers close to the harbor. The Russians took the bait, and sent out six destroyers in pursuit; whereupon the Japanese mined the entrance to the harbor and moved into position to block the destroyers\\' return. Two of the Russian destroyers were sunk, despite efforts by Admiral Makarov to come to their rescue.\\n', 'The Russian fleet attempted to break out from Port Arthur and proceed to Vladivostok, but they were intercepted and dispersed at the Battle of the Yellow Sea. The remnant of the Russian fleet remained in Port Arthur, where the ships were slowly sunk by the artillery of the besieging army. Attempts to relieve the city by land also failed, and after the Battle of Liaoyang in late August, the Russians retreated to Mukden (Shenyang). Port Arthur finally fell on 2 January 1905, after a series of brutal, high-casualty assaults.\\n', 'At 10:30 on December 5, following another massive artillery bombardment, the Japanese managed to overrun 203 Meter Hill overlooking the harbour of Port Arthur with the Russian Pacific Fleet at anchor. They sent an artillery observer on the hill, directing the fire of the 28\\xa0cm howitzer, systematically sinking the Russian fleet, one ship after another. On December 5, 1904, the battleship \"Poltava\" was sunk, followed by the battleship \"Retvizan\" on December 7, 1904, the battleships \"Pobeda\" and \"Peresvet\" and the cruisers \"Pallada\" and \"Bayan\" on December 9, 1904. All six would be raised, repaired, renamed, and recommissioned by the Japanese after the war. The battleship \"Sevastopol\", although hit five times by shells, managed to move out of range of the guns. On the night of January 2, 1905, after Port Arthur surrendered, Captain Nikolai Essen of the \"Sevastopol\" had the crippled battleship scuttled in of water by opening the sea cocks on one side, so that the ship would sink on its side and could not be raised and salvaged by the Japanese.\\n', 'During the Russo-Japanese War the Japanese Third Army was besieging Port Arthur. While the capture of Port Arthur had been achieved in a single assault during the First Sino-Japanese War the situation was different in 1904. The Russians had been in possession of Port Arthur since 1897 and had constructed strong fortifications around the city following the plans of General Eduard Totleben. After the first general assault in August 1904 and over 16,000 casualties General Nogi, the commanding officer of the Japanese forces, requested heavy siege guns. With the arrival of the first battery of 28\\xa0cm howitzers, replacing those lost when the transport \"Hitachi Maru\", loaded with a battalion of the First Reserve Regiment of the Guards, was sunk by Russian cruisers in the Hitachi Maru Incident on June 15, 1904, the situation changed. The massive, 11-inch, howitzers could throw a 217\\xa0kilogram (478\\xa0pound) shell over 7.8 kilometers (4.8\\xa0miles), and Nogi then had the firepower necessary to make a serious attempt against the Russian fortifications. The huge shells were nicknamed \"roaring trains\" by the Russian troops (for the sound they made just before impact), and during their period at Port Arthur over 16,949 of these shells were fired.\\n', 'When the Russo-Japanese War broke out in 1904, \"Rurik\" and the other cruisers of the Pacific Squadron, , , and , were all charged with seeking out and destroying Japanese merchant vessels in the Sea of Japan and along the coasts of the Japanese home islands. By August 1904, only one ship had been sunk and the Imperial Japanese Army had moved siege artillery close enough to shell the main Russian port in the Pacific, Port Arthur. The siege of Port Arthur kept most of the Russian naval vessels assigned to the Pacific Squadron inside the port, despite several failed attempts at breakout.\\n', 'During the war the bulk of the Russian Pacific Fleet was located in Port Arthur where they were blockaded by the Japanese. On 10 August 1904 the ships at Port Arthur attempted breakout to Vladivostok, but were turned back in the Battle of the Yellow Sea. Admiral Jessen was ordered to rendezvous with them, but the order was delayed and his ships had to raise steam, so he did not sortie until the evening of 13 August. \"Bogatyr\" had been damaged earlier when she grounded and did not sail with the squadron. By dawn he had reached the island of Tsushima in the Tsushima Strait between Korea and Japan. He turned back for Vladivostok when he failed to see any ships from the Port Arthur squadron. north of the island he encountered the Japanese squadron commanded by Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonoj\u014d tasked to patrol the Tsushima Strait. The Japanese force had four modern armored cruisers, , , , and . The two squadrons had passed during the night without spotting the other and each had reversed course around first light. This put the Japanese ships astride the Russian route to Vladivostok.\\n']\n\nTask Description:\nPlease extract content from these passages that can help enhance the model's causal reasoning and logical inference abilities.\nconsolidate these contents, and analyze how the selected information may impact the improvement of the model's causal reasoning and logical inference capabilities.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To enhance the model's causal reasoning and logical inference abilities, we can extract and consolidate key information from the provided passages regarding the events surrounding the destruction of the Russian fleet at Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War.

In the evening of 10 March 1904, the Japanese attempted a ruse by sending four destroyers close to the harbor. The Russians took the bait, and sent out six destroyers in pursuit; whereupon the Japanese mined the entrance to the harbor and moved into position to block the destroyers\\' return. Two of the Russian destroyers were sunk, despite efforts by Admiral Makarov to come to their rescue.\\n', 'The Russian fleet attempted to break out from Port Arthur and proceed to Vladivostok, but they were intercepted and dispersed at the Battle of the Yellow Sea. The remnant of the Russian fleet remained in Port Arthur, where the ships were slowly sunk by the artillery of the besieging army. Attempts to relieve the city by land also failed, and after the Battle of Liaoyang in late August, the Russians retreated to Mukden (Shenyang). Port Arthur finally fell on 2 January 1905, after a series of brutal, high-casualty assaults.\\n', 'At 10:30 on December 5, following another massive artillery bombardment, the Japanese managed to overrun 203 Meter Hill overlooking the harbour of Port Arthur with the Russian Pacific Fleet at anchor. They sent an artillery observer on the hill, directing the fire of the 28\\xa0cm howitzer, systematically sinking the Russian fleet, one ship after another.

While the capture of Port Arthur had been achieved in a single assault during the First Sino-Japanese War the situation was different in 1904. The Russians had been in possession of Port Arthur since 1897 and had constructed strong fortifications around the city following the plans of General Eduard Totleben. After the first general assault in August 1904 and over 16,000 casualties General Nogi, the commanding officer of the Japanese forces, requested heavy siege guns. With the arrival of the first battery of 28\\xa0cm howitzers, replacing those lost when the transport \"Hitachi Maru\", loaded with a battalion of the First Reserve Regiment of the Guards, was sunk by Russian cruisers in the Hitachi Maru Incident on June 15, 1904, the situation changed. The massive, 11-inch, howitzers could throw a 217\\xa0kilogram (478\\xa0pound) shell over 7.8 kilometers (4.8\\xa0miles), and Nogi then had the firepower necessary to make a serious attempt against the Russian fortifications. The huge shells were nicknamed \"roaring trains\" by the Russian troops (for the sound they made just before impact), and during their period at Port Arthur over 16,949 of these shells were fired.\\n', 'When the Russo-Japanese War broke out in 1904, \"Rurik\" and the other cruisers of the Pacific Squadron, , , and , were all charged with seeking out and destroying Japanese merchant vessels in the Sea of Japan and along the coasts of the Japanese home islands.

The Japanese faced challenges in effectively engaging the Russian fleet due to the strong coastal artillery protecting Port Arthur. Additionally, the Russian fleet was hesitant to leave the safety of the harbor for open sea battles, especially after the death of Admiral Makarov in April 1904.\n\n3. **Siege of Port Arthur**: The situation evolved into a prolonged siege, with Japanese forces gradually tightening their grip on the port. The siege culminated in the capture of Port Arthur on January 2, 1905, after extensive artillery bombardments and ground assaults.\n\n4. **Destruction of the Fleet**: After the fall of Port Arthur, the Russian fleet was systematically destroyed by Japanese artillery.

As result of sudden attack on Port Arthur, two Russian battleships were seriosly damaged by Tropedoes. This attack developed into a full-scale battle known as Siege of Port Arthur the next morning. Several attempts by Japanese Navy to attack Russian fleets were failed due to coastal artillery fire and the reluctance of the Russian fleet to leave the harbor for battle on the high seas, especially after the death of Admiral S. Makarov on April 13, 1904.\n", "On the night of 8 February 1904, the Japanese naval fleet under Admiral Heihachiro Togo opened the war with a surprise attack by torpedo boat destroyers on the Russian ships at Port Arthur, badly damaging two Russian battleships. The attacks developed into the Battle of Port Arthur the next morning. A series of indecisive naval engagements followed, in which the Japanese were unable to attack the Russian fleet successfully under shore batteries (\"coastal guns\") of the harbor and the Russians declined to leave the harbor for the open seas, especially after the death of Admiral Stepan Osipovich Makarov on 13 April 1904.\n", "On the night of 8 February 1904, the Japanese fleet under Admiral T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d opened the war with a surprise torpedo boat destroyer attack on the Russian ships at Port Arthur. The attack heavily damaged the \"Tsesarevich\" and \"Retvizan\", the heaviest battleships in Russia's far Eastern theater, and the 6,600\u00a0ton cruiser \"Pallada\". These attacks developed into the Battle of Port Arthur the next morning. A series of indecisive naval engagements followed, in which Admiral T\u014dg\u014d was unable to attack the Russian fleet successfully as it was protected by the shore batteries of the harbour, and the Russians were reluctant to leave the harbour for the open seas, especially after the death of Admiral Stepan Osipovich Makarov on 13 April 1904. Although the actual Battle of Port Arthur was indecisive, the initial attacks had a devastating psychological effect on Russia, which had been confident about the prospect of war. The Japanese had seized the initiative while the Russians waited in port.\n", "At about 22:30 on Monday 8 February 1904, the Port Arthur attack squadron of 10 destroyers encountered patrolling Russian destroyers. The Russians were under orders not to initiate combat, and turned to report the contact to headquarters. However, as a result of the encounter, two Japanese destroyers collided and fell behind and the remainder became scattered. At circa 00:28 on 9 February, the first four Japanese destroyers approached the port of Port Arthur without being observed, and launched a torpedo attack against the \"Pallada\" (which was hit amidship, caught fire, and keeled over) and the \"Retvizan\" (which was holed in her bow). The other Japanese destroyers were less successful; many of the torpedoes became caught in the extended torpedo nets which effectively prevented most of the torpedoes from striking the vitals of the Russian battleships. Other destroyers had arrived too late to benefit from surprise, and made their attacks individually rather than in a group. However, they were able to disable the most powerful ship of the Russian fleet, the battleship \"Tsesarevich\". The Japanese destroyer \"Oboro\" made the last attack, around 02:00, by which time the Russians were fully awake, and their searchlights and gunfire made accurate and close range torpedo attacks impossible.\n", "On Tuesday 8 March 1904, Russian Admiral Stepan Makarov arrived in Port Arthur to assume command from the unfortunate Admiral Stark, thus raising Russian morale.
