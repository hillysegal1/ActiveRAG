These are gaps between the cranial bones that have not yet fused, allowing for flexibility during birth. The anterior fontanelle is located at the top of the head, while the posterior fontanelle is at the back. This anatomical feature is crucial for accommodating the shape changes necessary for the baby's head to pass through the birth canal.\n\n2. **Role of Cranial Sutures**: The cranial sutures are fibrous joints that connect the bones of the skull. They remain flexible in infants, which is essential for the skull's ability to compress during delivery. This flexibility is what allows the fontanelles to function effectively during childbirth.\n\n3. **Malleability of the Fetal Head**: The fetal head is not fully developed at birth, which contributes to its malleability. This characteristic is vital for the baby's head to adapt and fit through the narrow birth canal, minimizing the risk of injury during delivery.\n\n4. **Post-Birth Development**: Fontanelles are not only important during childbirth but also play a significant role in the infant's growth after birth. They allow for the rapid expansion of the brain, which grows faster than the surrounding skull can accommodate.
