Operation Felix was a planned German invasion that was never executed. The context of World War II suggests that the Germans were interested in territories that were strategically important or had military significance. \n\nThe British Overseas Territories at the time included places like Gibraltar, Bermuda, the Falkland Islands, and others.

This is supported by multiple authoritative sources indicating that Gibraltar was the primary focus of the operation due to its strategic military significance at the entrance of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n2. **Strategic Importance**: Gibraltar's location allowed control over naval access to the Mediterranean, making it a critical point for British naval operations. The Germans recognized this importance, which is why Gibraltar was chosen as the target for Operation Felix.\n\n3. **Historical Context**: The operation was never executed and was ultimately abandoned. This abandonment was influenced by various factors, including the refusal of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco to allow German troops to pass through Spain, which was necessary for the invasion.\n\n4. **Broader Strategic Considerations**: While Gibraltar was the main target, there were also considerations for potential invasions of other territories, such as Portugal, Madeira, and the Azores. This indicates that the Germans had a broader strategic vision that included multiple locations, but Gibraltar remained the focal point.\n\n5. **Operational Changes**: The plan underwent modifications, including the amendment to \"Operation Felix-Heinrich,\" which reflected changing military priorities, particularly with the looming Operation Barbarossa. This highlights the dynamic nature of military planning during the war.\n\n6. **Directive Issued**: Hitler's Directive No. 18 specifically addressed the seizure of Gibraltar, emphasizing the formal military planning that underpinned Operation Felix. This detail adds depth to our understanding of the operation's significance within the broader context of World War II.\n\nBy integrating these points, we can conclude that Operation Felix was a significant military plan aimed at Gibraltar, reflecting both its strategic importance and the complexities of wartime decision-making.\n\n**Answer:**\nGibraltar"}], "question_info": {"question": "Operation Felix was the codename for a proposed German invasion of which British Overseas Territory during World War II?", "passages": ["BULLET::::- Operation Felix \u2013 The planned German invasion of Gibraltar\n", "BULLET::::- Operation Felix, a German World War II project to conquer Gibraltar\n", "BULLET::::- Operation Felix (Spanish/German joint plan for control of Gibraltar, Canary Islands, Cape Verde, and Azores)\n", "BULLET::::- Operation Felix 1940 - German planned invasion of Gibraltar via the Iberian Peninsula\n", "The Germans had planned an attack on Gibraltar, codenamed Operation Felix, which was never initiated.
