This film is central to our inquiry as it is the only film in 2007 where he received multiple Razzie nominations.\n\n2. **Awards Context**:\n   - The Golden Raspberry Awards, or Razzies, are given to recognize the worst in film. In 2007, \"Norbit\" was heavily criticized by audiences and critics alike, leading to Murphy receiving three Razzies: \n     - **Worst Actor** for his role as Norbit,\n     - **Worst Supporting Actor** for his role as Mr. Wong,\n     - **Worst Supporting Actress** for his role as Rasputia.\n\n3. **Critical Reception**:\n   - Despite being a commercial success, grossing $159 million against a $60 million budget, \"Norbit\" was poorly received critically. This juxtaposition of commercial success and critical failure is significant, as it illustrates that financial performance does not always correlate with quality or acclaim.\n\n4. **Historical Context**:\n   - Prior to \"Norbit,\" Murphy had received acclaim for his role in \"Dreamgirls\" (2006), where he was nominated for an Academy Award. The shift in public perception from an Oscar-nominated performance to a Razzie-winning one highlights how quickly an actor's reputation can change based on their film choices.\n\n5. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - The information indicates that negative critical reception can lead to nominations for \"worst\" awards, even when a film is commercially successful. This understanding helps the model grasp the complexities of the film industry, where audience and critical reception can diverge significantly.\n\n6. **Logical Inference**:\n   - The model can infer that Murphy's performances in \"Norbit\" were poorly received, leading to the Razzie nominations. Additionally, the contrast between his previous success and the failure of \"Norbit\" provides insight into the unpredictable nature of an actor's career trajectory.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy synthesizing this information, we enhance the model's ability to reason about the causal relationships between film quality, critical reception, and awards. This understanding can be applied to various contexts, improving the model's overall reasoning capabilities.\n\n### Answer:\nNorbit"}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nWhat 2007 movie earned Eddie Murphy the Golden Raspberry for Worst Actor, Worst Supporting Actor, and Worst Supporting Actress?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The film was nominated for three Razzie Awards: Worst Remake, Worst Actor for Eddie Murphy, and Worst Screen Couple for Murphy and Owen Wilson.\\n', 'It was nominated for two Razzie Awards, Worst Actor (Eddie Murphy) and Worst Screen Couple (Eddie Murphy \"in\" Eddie Murphy).\\n', 'In 1988 during Eddie Murphy\\'s (who was nominated in 2007) presentation of the Best Picture category, Murphy gave an impromptu speech on how he felt that the Academy Awards were racist, stating only three black people had won the award.
