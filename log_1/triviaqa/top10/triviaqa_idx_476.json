Each house is associated with a founder: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. This foundational knowledge allows us to recognize the complete set of houses.\n\n2. **Purpose and Function of Houses**: The houses serve as communities for students, fostering competition and camaraderie through events like the House Cup and Quidditch Cup. Points are awarded or deducted based on student behavior and performance, which creates a dynamic environment for social interaction and rivalry. This context helps us understand the significance of each house in the broader narrative.\n\n3. **Sorting Process**: First-year students are assigned to houses by the Sorting Hat, which evaluates their personalities and traits. This emphasizes the importance of individual characteristics in determining group identity, suggesting that students are placed in houses that align with their values and traits.\n\n4. **Cultural and Social Dynamics**: The interactions between houses, including rivalries and alliances, contribute to character development and the overall narrative. This highlights how the houses are not merely academic divisions but also social constructs that influence student experiences and relationships.\n\n5. **Behavioral Consequences**: The point system for house competitions illustrates cause-and-effect relationships.
