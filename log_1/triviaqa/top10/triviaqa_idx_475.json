Most of this tradition is spurious, but in the case of Offa, a case for possible historicity of a 5th-century figure has been made because of a matching account by Saxo Grammaticus. Offa of Essex and Offa of Mercia are two historical Anglo-Saxon kings. Offa of Mercia is said to have had been named Winfreth originally, and to have been the son of an ealdorman named Tingfrith. Because he miraculously recovered from a state of lameness and blindness as a child, he was called \"the second Offa\", after Offa of Angel, whose legend states that he underwent a similar recovery.\\n', \"Offa was a Christian king who came into conflict with the Church, particularly with J\u00e6nberht, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Offa persuaded Pope Adrian I to divide the archdiocese of Canterbury in two, creating a new archdiocese of Lichfield. This reduction in the power of Canterbury may have been motivated by Offa's desire to have an archbishop consecrate his son Ecgfrith as king, since it is possible J\u00e6nberht refused to perform the ceremony, which took place in 787. Offa had a dispute with the Bishop of Worcester, which was settled at the Council of Brentford in 781.\\n\", 'Many historians regard Offa as the most powerful Anglo-Saxon king before Alfred the Great. His dominance never extended to Northumbria, though he gave his daughter \u00c6lffl\u00e6d in marriage to the Northumbrian king \u00c6thelred I in 792. Historians once saw his reign as part of a process leading to a unified England, but this is no longer the majority view. In the words of a recent historian: \"Offa was driven by a lust for power, not a vision of English unity; and what he left was a reputation, not a legacy.\" Offa died in 796; his son, Ecgfrith, succeeded him, but reigned for less than five months before Coenwulf of Mercia became king.\\n', 'The evidence for Offa\\'s involvement in the kingdom of Sussex comes from charters, and as with Kent there is no clear consensus among historians on the course of events. What little evidence survives that bears on Sussex\\'s kings indicates that several kings ruled at once, and it may never have formed a single kingdom. It has been argued that Offa\\'s authority was recognised early in his reign by local kings in western Sussex, but that eastern Sussex (the area around Hastings) submitted to him less readily. Symeon of Durham, a twelfth-century chronicler, records that in 771 Offa defeated \"the people of Hastings\", which may record the extension of Offa\\'s dominion over the entire kingdom. However, doubts have been expressed about the authenticity of the charters which support this version of events, and it is possible that Offa\\'s direct involvement in Sussex was limited to a short period around 770\u201371. After 772, there is no further evidence of Mercian involvement in Sussex until c. 790, and it may be that Offa gained control of Sussex in the late 780s, as he did in Kent.\\n', \"Offa was King of Mercia, a kingdom of Anglo-Saxon England, from 757 until his death in July 796. The son of Thingfrith and a descendant of Eowa, Offa came to the throne after a period of civil war following the assassination of \u00c6thelbald. Offa defeated the other claimant, Beornred. In the early years of Offa's reign, it is likely that he consolidated his control of Midland peoples such as the Hwicce and the Magons\u00e6te. Taking advantage of instability in the kingdom of Kent to establish himself as overlord, Offa also controlled Sussex by 771, though his authority did not remain unchallenged in either territory. In the 780s he extended Mercian Supremacy over most of southern England, allying with Beorhtric of Wessex, who married Offa's daughter Eadburh, and regained complete control of the southeast. He also became the overlord of East Anglia and had King \u00c6thelberht II of East Anglia beheaded in 794, perhaps for rebelling against him.\\n\", 'The power and prestige that Offa attained made him one of the most significant rulers in Early Medieval Britain, though no contemporary biography of him survives. A key source for the period is the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", a collection of annals in Old English narrating the history of the Anglo-Saxons. The \"Chronicle\" was a West Saxon production, however, and is sometimes thought to be biased in favour of Wessex; hence it may not accurately convey the extent of power achieved by Offa, a Mercian. That power can be seen at work in charters dating from Offa\\'s reign. Charters were documents which granted land to followers or to churchmen and were witnessed by the kings who had the authority to grant the land. A charter might record the names of both a subject king and his overlord on the witness list appended to the grant. Such a witness list can be seen on the Ismere Diploma, for example, where \u00c6thelric, son of king Oshere of the Hwicce, is described as a \"\"subregulus\"\", or subking, of \u00c6thelbald\\'s. The eighth-century monk and chronicler the Venerable Bede wrote a history of the English church called \"Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum\"; the history only covers events up to 731, but as one of the major sources for Anglo-Saxon history it provides important background information for Offa\\'s reign.\\n', 'According to \"Widsith\" and the Danish sources, Offa successfully conquered the Myrgings, possibly a clan of Saxon origin, and incorporated their land into Angel or Danish lands, by slaying two Myrging princes in single combat and installing himself as their king.\\n', 'The independent existence of the Kingdom of Sussex came to an end in the early 770s. In 771, King Offa of Mercia conquered the territory of the \"Haestingas\"; he may have entered Sussex from the Kingdom of Kent, where he was already dominant. By 772 he apparently controlled the whole of the Kingdom of Sussex. Offa also confirmed two charters of \u00c6\u00f0elberht, and in 772 he grants land himself in Sussex, with Oswald, \"dux Su\u00f0sax\", as a witness.

The perception of his reign in the context of English unity and his motivations for power provide a more comprehensive view of his historical significance.\n\n6. **Charters and Governance**: The passages mention charters as a means of governance and the role of subkings under Offa's rule, which sheds light on the administrative structure of his kingdom.\n\n7. **Controversy and Authenticity**: The authenticity of historical records, such as the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,\" is discussed, highlighting potential biases that could affect our understanding of Offa's reign.\n\nIn summary, the model's knowledge can be updated with specific details about Offa's reign, his conflicts, territorial control, and the administrative context of his rule. This enhanced reasoning process provides a more accurate representation of Offa's historical significance and helps alleviate potential model illusions.\n\n**Answer:**\nMercia"}], "question_info": {"question": "Of which Saxon kingdom was Offa a King?", "passages": ["Offa is a legendary king of the Angles in the genealogy of the kings of Mercia presented in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\". He is the son of Wermund and the father of Angeltheow.\n", "Offa was King of Mercia, a kingdom of Anglo-Saxon England, from 757 until his death in July 796.\n", "Offa of Angel is a legendary king of the Angles recorded in the 9th-century genealogical tradition of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\". Most of this tradition is spurious, but in the case of Offa, a case for possible historicity of a 5th-century figure has been made because of a matching account by Saxo Grammaticus. Offa of Essex and Offa of Mercia are two historical Anglo-Saxon kings. Offa of Mercia is said to have had been named Winfreth originally, and to have been the son of an ealdorman named Tingfrith. Because he miraculously recovered from a state of lameness and blindness as a child, he was called \"the second Offa\", after Offa of Angel, whose legend states that he underwent a similar recovery.\n", "Offa was a Christian king who came into conflict with the Church, particularly with J\u00e6nberht, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Offa persuaded Pope Adrian I to divide the archdiocese of Canterbury in two, creating a new archdiocese of Lichfield. This reduction in the power of Canterbury may have been motivated by Offa's desire to have an archbishop consecrate his son Ecgfrith as king, since it is possible J\u00e6nberht refused to perform the ceremony, which took place in 787. Offa had a dispute with the Bishop of Worcester, which was settled at the Council of Brentford in 781.\n", "Many historians regard Offa as the most powerful Anglo-Saxon king before Alfred the Great. His dominance never extended to Northumbria, though he gave his daughter \u00c6lffl\u00e6d in marriage to the Northumbrian king \u00c6thelred I in 792. Historians once saw his reign as part of a process leading to a unified England, but this is no longer the majority view. In the words of a recent historian: \"Offa was driven by a lust for power, not a vision of English unity; and what he left was a reputation, not a legacy.\" Offa died in 796; his son, Ecgfrith, succeeded him, but reigned for less than five months before Coenwulf of Mercia became king.\n", "The evidence for Offa's involvement in the kingdom of Sussex comes from charters, and as with Kent there is no clear consensus among historians on the course of events. What little evidence survives that bears on Sussex's kings indicates that several kings ruled at once, and it may never have formed a single kingdom. It has been argued that Offa's authority was recognised early in his reign by local kings in western Sussex, but that eastern Sussex (the area around Hastings) submitted to him less readily. Symeon of Durham, a twelfth-century chronicler, records that in 771 Offa defeated \"the people of Hastings\", which may record the extension of Offa's dominion over the entire kingdom. However, doubts have been expressed about the authenticity of the charters which support this version of events, and it is possible that Offa's direct involvement in Sussex was limited to a short period around 770\u201371. After 772, there is no further evidence of Mercian involvement in Sussex until c. 790, and it may be that Offa gained control of Sussex in the late 780s, as he did in Kent.\n", "Offa was King of Mercia, a kingdom of Anglo-Saxon England, from 757 until his death in July 796. The son of Thingfrith and a descendant of Eowa, Offa came to the throne after a period of civil war following the assassination of \u00c6thelbald. Offa defeated the other claimant, Beornred. In the early years of Offa's reign, it is likely that he consolidated his control of Midland peoples such as the Hwicce and the Magons\u00e6te. Taking advantage of instability in the kingdom of Kent to establish himself as overlord, Offa also controlled Sussex by 771, though his authority did not remain unchallenged in either territory. In the 780s he extended Mercian Supremacy over most of southern England, allying with Beorhtric of Wessex, who married Offa's daughter Eadburh, and regained complete control of the southeast. He also became the overlord of East Anglia and had King \u00c6thelberht II of East Anglia beheaded in 794, perhaps for rebelling against him.\n", "The power and prestige that Offa attained made him one of the most significant rulers in Early Medieval Britain, though no contemporary biography of him survives. A key source for the period is the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", a collection of annals in Old English narrating the history of the Anglo-Saxons. The \"Chronicle\" was a West Saxon production, however, and is sometimes thought to be biased in favour of Wessex; hence it may not accurately convey the extent of power achieved by Offa, a Mercian. That power can be seen at work in charters dating from Offa's reign. Charters were documents which granted land to followers or to churchmen and were witnessed by the kings who had the authority to grant the land. A charter might record the names of both a subject king and his overlord on the witness list appended to the grant. Such a witness list can be seen on the Ismere Diploma, for example, where \u00c6thelric, son of king Oshere of the Hwicce, is described as a \"\"subregulus\"\", or subking, of \u00c6thelbald's. The eighth-century monk and chronicler the Venerable Bede wrote a history of the English church called \"Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum\"; the history only covers events up to 731, but as one of the major sources for Anglo-Saxon history it provides important background information for Offa's reign.\n", "According to \"Widsith\" and the Danish sources, Offa successfully conquered the Myrgings, possibly a clan of Saxon origin, and incorporated their land into Angel or Danish lands, by slaying two Myrging princes in single combat and installing himself as their king.\n", "The independent existence of the Kingdom of Sussex came to an end in the early 770s. In 771, King Offa of Mercia conquered the territory of the \"Haestingas\"; he may have entered Sussex from the Kingdom of Kent, where he was already dominant. By 772 he apparently controlled the whole of the Kingdom of Sussex. Offa also confirmed two charters of \u00c6\u00f0elberht, and in 772 he grants land himself in Sussex, with Oswald, \"dux Su\u00f0sax\", as a witness. It is probable that about this time Offa annexed the kingdom of Sussex, as several persons, Osmund, \u00c6lfwald and Oslac, who had previously used the royal title, now sign with that of \"dux\".\n"], "__answers__": ["Mercians", "Mercians", "Kingdom of Mercia", "Mercia", "Mercia", "Mercia", "kingdom of mercia", "Miercna", "Flag of Mercia", "Mierce", "mercians", "mercia", "miercna", "mierce", "Kingdom of the Iclingas", "MERCIA", "kingdom of iclingas", "flag of mercia"]}}
