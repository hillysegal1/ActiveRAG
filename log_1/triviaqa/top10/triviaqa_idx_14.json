Understanding this context is crucial for identifying the civil rights leader depicted in the film.\n\n2. **Key Figures**: The film centers around two main characters: Steve Biko, a prominent anti-apartheid activist, and Donald Woods, a journalist who initially misunderstands Biko's methods but later becomes an ally. Recognizing their relationship is essential for understanding the narrative.\n\n3. **Biko's Activism**: Steve Biko was a leader of the Black Consciousness Movement, which aimed to empower black South Africans and raise awareness about the injustices of apartheid. His activism is a central theme of the film, illustrating the struggles faced by those opposing the regime.\n\n4. **Consequences of Activism**: Biko's activism led to severe government repression, including harassment and ultimately his death while in police custody. This event not only highlights the risks faced by activists but also serves as a catalyst for international outrage and condemnation of the apartheid government.\n\n5. **Impact on Society**: The aftermath of Biko's death had significant repercussions, including the imposition of an arms embargo against South Africa by the United Nations. This illustrates the broader impact of individual actions on global politics and societal change.\n\n6. **Moral and Ethical Considerations**: The film also raises ethical questions about journalism and activism, particularly in how Woods responds to Biko's death by exposing the truth.
