Both are historically significant and well-known for their high-value auctions in art, antiques, and collectibles.\n\n1. **Founding and Historical Context**:\n   - Sotheby's was founded in 1744, making it one of the oldest auction houses in continuous operation.\n   - Christie's was established later in 1766 but has since grown to become the largest auction house in the world.\n\n2. **Sales Volume and Market Position**:\n   - Christie's has consistently been recognized as the largest auction house in terms of total sales volume. For instance, in 2018, Christie's reported sales of \u00a35.3 billion (approximately $7 billion), which underscores its dominant position in the market.\n   - Sotheby's, while also significant, is currently the second-largest auction house, with global sales reported at $5.8 billion in 2011.\n\n3. **Notable Auctions**:\n   - Christie's has conducted record-breaking auctions, such as the sale of the \"Salvator Mundi\" for $450.3 million in 2017 and the Peggy and David Rockefeller collection for $835.1 million in 2018. These high-profile sales contribute to its reputation and market dominance.\n   - Sotheby's has a strong global presence with 90 locations in 40 countries, but it has not matched Christie's in terms of individual auction sales records.\n\n4. **Market Dynamics**:\n   - The auction industry is influenced by various factors, including the types of items auctioned, the historical significance of the auction houses, and their ability to attract high-profile consignments. Christie's has excelled in these areas, further solidifying its status as the largest auction house.\n\n5. **Comparative Analysis**:\n   - By comparing the sales figures, historical significance, and market strategies of both auction houses, we can infer that Christie's has a more substantial impact on the auction market, particularly in the art sector.\n\nBased on this enhanced reasoning process, we conclude that Christie's is the world's largest auction house, supported by its sales volume, historical significance, and record-breaking auctions.\n\n### Answer:\nChristie's"}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nWhat company is the world's largest auction house?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n[\"MacDougall's is a privately owned international auction house based in London, England.
