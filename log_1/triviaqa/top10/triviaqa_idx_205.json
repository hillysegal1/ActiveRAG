This information could confuse the model if it is not properly contextualized.\n\n4. **International Recognition**: The passage discussing Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its stance on Jerusalem as the capital of Israel provides insight into Taiwan's diplomatic position but does not contradict the fact that Taipei is the capital of Taiwan.

The capital city serves as the political and administrative center of the island.

For instance, it is stated that \"Taipei is the capital and a special municipality of Taiwan (officially known as the Republic of China)\" and \"BULLET::::- Capital : Taipei.\" This confirms that Taipei is recognized as the capital.\n\n2. **De Facto Status**: It is also important to note that Taipei has been the \"de facto\" capital of the Republic of China since 1949. This historical context is significant as it highlights the continuity of Taipei's status as the center of government and administration.\n\n3. **Contradictory Information**: Some passages mention \"State capital: Taiping\" and \"It has the capital at Taiyuan.\" These statements are misleading in the context of Taiwan, as they refer to other locations and do not pertain to Taiwan's capital.
