This declaration initiated a protracted struggle against Dutch attempts to reassert control, leading to a complex conflict characterized by both diplomatic negotiations and armed resistance.\n\n4. **Formal Recognition of Sovereignty**: The culmination of this struggle occurred in December 1949 when the Netherlands officially recognized Indonesian sovereignty. This recognition marked a pivotal moment in Indonesia's transition from colonial rule to independence, although the Dutch retained control over Western New Guinea for several more years.\n\n5. **International Dynamics**: The role of international actors, particularly the United States, influenced the negotiations and the eventual recognition of Indonesian independence. This context highlights the geopolitical factors that shaped the outcome of Indonesia's independence movement.\n\n### Summary and Integration:\n\nThe European nation that served as the colonial power of Indonesia for 350 years until officially ceding control in December 1949 is the **Netherlands**. This colonial relationship began in the early 17th century with the establishment of the Dutch East Indies and persisted until the aftermath of World War II. The Japanese occupation disrupted Dutch control, allowing Indonesian nationalists to declare independence in 1945. The subsequent struggle for sovereignty culminated in the Netherlands formally recognizing Indonesia's independence in December 1949, despite retaining control over Western New Guinea for a time. This historical context emphasizes the complexities of colonialism, national identity, and international relations that influenced Indonesia's path to independence.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe Netherlands."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nWhich European nation was the colonial power of Indonesia for 350 years until officially ceding control in December 1949?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n[\"Prior to WWII, Indonesia had been one of the most lucrative colonies for the Netherlands.

A four and half year diplomatic and armed struggle ensued between the Dutch and Indonesian republicans. It ended in December 1949 with the Netherlands recognising Indonesian sovereignty over the Dutch East Indies with the exception of Dutch New Guinea. Unable to reach a compromise on the region, the conference closed with the parties agreeing to discuss the issue within one year.\n", "In December 1949, at the end of the Indonesian National Revolution, the Netherlands agreed to recognise Indonesian sovereignty over the territories of the former Dutch East Indies, with the exception of Western New Guinea, which the Dutch continued to hold as Netherlands New Guinea. The nationalist Indonesian government argued that it was the successor state to the whole of the Dutch East Indies and wanted to end the Dutch colonial presence in the archipelago. The Netherlands argued that the Papuans were ethnically different and that the Netherlands would continue to administer the territory until it was capable of self-determination. From 1950 onwards, the Dutch and the Western powers agreed that the Papuans should be given an independent state, but due to global considerations, mainly the Kennedy administration's concern to keep Indonesia on their side of the Cold War, the United States pressured the Dutch to sacrifice Papua's independence and transfer the territory to Indonesia.\n", "The Indonesian national revolution (1945\u20131949) ended with the Netherlands' recognition of the Republic of Indonesia. The Indonesian declaration of independence from the Dutch in 1949 was announced in Gambir Palace. During the ceremony, the Dutch flag was substituted with the Flag of Indonesia. Many spectators were rejoicing when the flag was hoisted, and yelled \"Merdeka! (Freedom!)\". From that moment, Gambir Palace became known as Merdeka Palace. Tony Lovink, the High Commissioner of the Dutch Crown was the last man representing the Dutch power to leave the Palace. The name of the palace officially changed to Istana Merdeka (\"Indendepence Place\") on 28 December 1949 at 17.55 hours.\n", "Indonesia had been a Dutch colony since 1800 as a part of the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch were expelled in March 1942 by the Japanese occupation of Indonesia. After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Sukarno declared independence on August 17, 1945. However, the Netherlands attempted to reestablish their colony during a prolonged war that lasted for four and a half years. Ultimately the struggle was unsuccessful for the Netherlands, and in December 1949, the Netherlands formally recognized Indonesian sovereignty.\n", "Two days after the Japanese surrender in August 1945, Sukarno and fellow nationalist leader Hatta unilaterally declared Indonesian independence. A four and a half-year struggle followed as the Dutch tried to re-establish their colony. Dutch forces eventually re-occupied most of the colonial territory and a guerrilla struggle ensued. The majority of Indonesians, and \u2013 ultimately \u2013 international opinion, favored independence, and in December 1949, the Netherlands formally recognized Indonesian sovereignty. Under the terms of the 1949 agreement, Western New Guinea remained under the auspices of Netherlands New Guinea. The new Indonesian government under President Sukarno pressured for the territory to come under Indonesian control as Indonesian nationalists initially intended. Following United States pressure, the Netherlands transferred it to Indonesia under the 1962 New York Agreement.\n", "During the independence movement of Indonesia, Indonesian republicans included South Maluku as part of the independent Indonesia they declared in 1945. Indonesia's struggle to secure its independence lasted from 1945 until 1949. After international pressure, the Dutch acknowledged a federal Indonesian republic on 27 December 1949. In the first instance, the Netherlands only acknowledged the independence of Indonesia as a federation of autonomous states, of which one was South Maluku.\n", "Indonesia gained independence from the Netherlands in 1949 after the latter failed to restore colonial control. As mentioned above, Indonesia also wanted a powerful position in the region that could be lessened by the creation of united Malaysia. The Netherlands retained Dutch New Guinea, but Indonesia threatened to invade and annex it. A vote was supposedly taken under the UN sponsored Act of Free Choice to allow West New Guineans to decide their fate, although many dispute its veracity. Later, Portugal relinquished control over East Timor in 1975, at which time Indonesia promptly invaded and annexed it.\n", "\"(Indonesia)\" Dutch East Indies took over the Portuguese trading posts in Maluku Indonesia in 1605. In 1619 a defensive military base was built in Batavia (now Jakarta) to become the headquarters of the Dutch East Indies Company. Until the twentieth century when Indonesia gained independence followed by the Indonesian revolution. In WWII Holland were occupied by Nazi Germany and Indonesia by Japan. After the war the Dutch tried to retake control, though the people started to fight for liberation. Only Dutch New Guinea remained with the Dutch until 1962. \n", "After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, ending World War II, Sukarno proclaimed the independence of Indonesia on August 17, 1945, and became the nation's first president. While the Japanese soon left the former Dutch East Indies, the Dutch returned to reclaim former colonies in 1946. Indonesian militias fought the Dutch for three years in the Indonesian National Revolution. One of the militias\u2014the Siliwangi Division of the Indonesian Army, based in West Java\u2014was led by Kartosuwirjo, who had initially supported the Japanese during their three years of occupation.\n"], "__answers__": ["Northern Netherlands", "The Netherlands", "The Netherlands", "The Netherlands", "Netherlands", "Netherlands", "Netherlands", "Netherlands", "European Netherlands", "Netherlands (European territory)", "Administrative divisions of the netherlands", "nyderlandai", "Netherlands, (Dut/Hol)", "northern netherlands", "climate of netherlands", "ISO 3166-1:NL", "Olanda", "Nederlandia", "Administrative divisions of the Netherlands", "Netherlands, The", "netherland", "iso 3166 1 nl", "Neatherlands", "Metropolitan Netherlands", "dutch inhabitants", "netherlands historytalk", "netheralands", "The netherlands", "netherlands", "neatherlands", "nederlandia", "european netherlands", "capitals of holland", "pays bas", "administrative divisions of netherlands", "olanda", "Holland (country)", "NETHERLANDS", "netherlands dut hol", "subdivisions of netherlands", "The Netheralands", "netherlands european territory", "holland country", "Nehterlands", "mainland netherlands", "The netherland", "Pays-Bas", "Netherlands/HistoryTalk", "Capitals of Holland", "Climate of the Netherlands", "Dutch inhabitants", "Nyderlandai", "Mainland Netherlands", "nehterlands", "Subdivisions of the Netherlands", "metropolitan netherlands"]}}
