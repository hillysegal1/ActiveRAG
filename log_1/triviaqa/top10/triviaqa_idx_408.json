Tony Trabert has said that of the players he saw before the start of the open era, Kramer was the best male champion.\n", "This was the second Grand Slam final the two played, and the first time the two had met at Flushing Meadows. After a 4-hour, 54 minute long final, Murray defeated Djokovic to claim his first ever major title, making him the first British man to win a Grand Slam title since Fred Perry in 1936. Murray claimed the first two sets, the first in a 24-minute tiebreak, and the second by 7 games to 5 after being 4\u20130 up at one point, before Djokovic levelled the scoring to take the match into a deciding fifth set, in which Murray regained his prior momentum and emerged victorious. This match equals the record set by Ivan Lendl and Mats Wilander as the longest US Open final in history, as well as the second longest major final in the Open Era, behind the 2012 Australian Open final (which also featured Djokovic). It also featured the longest ever tie-break in a US Open final, with a 12\u201310 final score in the first set.\n", "The fourth battle of the year came at the 2012 French Open final. For the second time in tennis history, two opposing tennis players played four consecutive Grand Slams finals against each other. This was a match of historic proportions as either Nadal would have broken Bj\u00f6rn Borg's record of six titles at the French Open or Djokovic would have become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win four Grand Slams in a row. Nadal eventually emerged victorious after 3 consecutive losses in Grand Slam finals, prevailing in 4 sets after multiple rain delays that forced the final to be concluded on the following Monday afternoon. With this victory, Nadal became the most successful tennis player at the French Open, winning seven French Open titles.\n", "Pete Sampras successfully defended his title for the fourth consecutive year, defeating Pat Rafter in the final, 6\u20137, 7\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20132 to win the Gentlemen's Singles tennis title at the 2000 Wimbledon Championships. Sampras' 7th Wimbledon title equalled William Renshaw's record, and was an Open Era record in the Gentleman's Singles until 2017, when Roger Federer won his 8th title. His victory was his 13th Grand Slam title, surpassing Roy Emerson as the overall leader in Grand Slam singles titles. This was to be Sampras' last Wimbledon title. \n"], "__answers__": ["Fred Perry", "Fred J. Perry", "frederick john perry", "fred perry", "fred j perry", "Frederick John Perry"]}}
