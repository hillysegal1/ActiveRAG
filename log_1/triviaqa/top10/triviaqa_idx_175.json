This is established by the biblical narrative where he and his brother, Andrew, were engaged in fishing on the Sea of Galilee when Jesus called them to follow him. This indicates that his primary occupation prior to becoming an apostle was fishing.\n\n2. **Transition to Apostleship**: The calling of Peter to become a \"fisher of men\" signifies a transformative moment where his occupation shifted from a physical trade to a spiritual leadership role. This transition is crucial for understanding the evolution of his identity from a fisherman to a leader within the early Christian church.\n\n3. **Leadership Role**: As the \"first leader of the early Church,\" Peter's role extended beyond that of a mere apostle. He is recognized as the chief of the Apostles by various Christian denominations, indicating a significant authority and responsibility in guiding the early Christian community.\n\n4. **Authority and Primacy**: The distinction between Peter's chronological position among the apostles and his authoritative role highlights the complexity of leadership. While he was not the first apostle chosen, he was given a primacy that established him as a key figure in the church's foundation.\n\n5. **Symbolism of Keys**: The \"keys\" symbolize Peter's teaching authority and governance within the church. This role is foundational for the concept of Apostolic succession, which underscores the continuity of leadership and authority in the Christian tradition.\n\n6. **Causal Relationships**: The passages suggest that Peter's leadership directly contributed to the establishment of the church's authority structure.

This complexity is essential for understanding the dynamics of early Christian leadership and the collaborative nature of their mission.\n\n### Answer:\nSt. Peter, also known as Simon Peter, was originally a fisherman by trade before becoming one of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ.
