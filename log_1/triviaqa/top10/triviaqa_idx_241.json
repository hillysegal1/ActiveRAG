Although Poland was under partition and not an independent country during her birth, it is recognized as her birthplace. The retrieved passages confirm this information, stating that she was born in Warsaw and referring to her as \"Polish-born.\" \n\nAdditionally, it is important to note that during her birth, Warsaw was part of the Russian Empire, which is highlighted in several passages. This context is crucial for understanding her identity and heritage. The passages also emphasize her dual identity as both Polish and French, which is significant in recognizing her contributions to science. \n\nGiven that Austria and Switzerland are not related to her origin, the correct answer remains Poland. The passages reinforce the understanding that while she was born in a region that was politically complex, her identity is firmly rooted in Poland.\n\n### Answer:\nPoland"}], "question_info": {"question": "In which country was Marie Curie born?
