The allegorical nature of \"Animal Farm\" allows for a deeper exploration of historical events and their representation in literature, improving the model's capacity for logical inference.\n\n### Answer:\nSnowball is a pig in George Orwell's \"Animal Farm.\" He represents Leon Trotsky and plays a crucial role in the animal rebellion against the human farmer, characterized by his intelligence and commitment to the principles of Animalism.
