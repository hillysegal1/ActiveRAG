Historical records indicate that No\u00ebl Coward spent his later years in Jamaica, where he owned a home. This detail is significant because it suggests that, despite his British nationality, he passed away in Jamaica.\n\n4. **Causal Relationships**: The information establishes a causal relationship between Coward's nationality and his residence at the time of death.
