Jeremy Irons frequently plays antagonistic or nuanced roles, while Renee Zellweger has portrayed a variety of characters, including widows, which is a common trope in Western narratives.\n\n2. **Narrowing Down by Year and Genre**: The film in question is specifically from 2008 and falls within the Western genre.
