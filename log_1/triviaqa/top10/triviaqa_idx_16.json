Contained sand (CS) uses sand fill or any fill too dry or with poor cohesion that performs structurally like sandbags. CS must be built with solid-weave fabric bags and have good protection from fabric damage, relying on the strength of the bag fabric for wall strength. CS needs more vertical reinforcement for both shear and out-of-plane strength than CE, or may require a structural skin. Some builders use narrow bags of contained sand as wall infill. \\n', 'Common shield construction types include:\\n', 'Composite liners are used in municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills to reduce water pollution. A composite liner is made of a geomembrane along with a geosynthetic clay liner. Composite-liner systems are better at reducing leachate migration into the subsoil than either a clay liner or a single geomembrane layer.\\n', 'AlSiC composites are suitable replacements for copper-molybdenum (CuMo) and copper-tungsten (CuW) alloys; they have about 1/3 the weight of copper, 1/5 of CuMo, and 1/6 of CuW, making them suitable for weight-sensitive applications; they are also stronger and stiffer than copper. They are stiff, lightweight, and strong. They can be used as heatsinks, substrates for power electronics (e.g. IGBTs and high-power LEDs), heat spreaders, housings for electronics, and lids for chips, e.g. microprocessors and ASICs. Metal and ceramic inserts and channels for a coolant can be integrated into the parts during manufacture. AlSiC composites can be produced relatively inexpensively (USD 2-4/lb in large series); the dedicated tooling however causes large up-front expenses, making AlSiC more suitable for mature designs. Heat pipes can be embedded into AlSiC, raising effective heat conductivity to 500\u2013800 W/m K.\\n', 'GE is using ceramic matrix composites (CMC) to build the turbine shrouds.\\n', 'Due to the extreme temperatures involved, nose cones for high-speed applications (e.g. hypersonic speeds or atmospheric reentry of orbital vehicles) have to be made of refractory materials. Pyrolytic carbon is one choice, reinforced carbon-carbon composite or HRSI ceramics are other popular choices. Another design strategy is using ablative heat shields, which get consumed during operation, disposing of excess heat that way. Materials used for ablative shields include, for example carbon phenolic, polydimethylsiloxane composite with silica filler and carbon fibers, or as in of some Chinese FSW reentry vehicles, oak wood.\\n', 'BULLET::::- CCS are made of HDPE, NPA, low-density polyethylene and nonwoven heat-bonded geotextiles.\\n', 'CF-SMC are made up of carbon tow chunks, spread between two layers of uncured thermosetting resin. The carbon fibre tows are cut from prepreg UD tape. The originating tape can be made up of a certain number of fibres (filaments), thus affecting the properties of the final composite: values can vary from 3 to 50 thousand filaments, while typical tow lengths are within 10 to 50 mm. As for the resin, thermosetting resins are used: possible choices are polyester, vinyl ester or epoxy, with the former being the cheapest and the latter being the most performant. Despite not being as strong nor stiff as epoxy, vinyl ester is often used for its properties like corrosion and higher temperature resistance. The constituents are combined in sheets of prepreg material. The tows usually fall from the cutter to one of the two layers of resin, and are then covered by the second layer. The prepreg sheets of SMC are made after the viscous assemble is compacted via rolls. In this phase, any control over the orientation of the fibres is generally impossible, and the fibres can be considered to have an equiprobable orientation in all directions. \\n', 'Mechanical properties of CMCs, including SiC\u2013SiC composites can vary depending on the properties of their various components, namely, the fiber, matrix, and interphases. For example, the size, composition, crystallinity, or alignment of the fibers will dictate the properties of the composite. The interplay between matrix microcracking and fiber-matrix debonding often dominates the failure mechanism of SiC/SiC composites. This results in SiC/SiC composites having non-brittle behavior despite being fully ceramic. Additionally, creep rates at high temperatures are also extremely low, but still dependent on its various constituents.\\n', 'Toward the challenge of organizing CNTs at larger scales, hierarchical fiber composites are created by growing aligned forests onto glass, silicon carbide (SiC), alumina and carbon fibers, creating so-called \"fuzzy\" fibers. Fuzzy epoxy CNT-SiC and CNT-alumina fabric showed 69% improved crack-opening (mode I) and/or in-plane shear interlaminar (mode II) toughness.
