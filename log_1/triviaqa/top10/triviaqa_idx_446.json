A key figure in this movement was Andr\u00e9 Breton, who played a significant role as a theorist and organizer. \n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), the Surrealist movement was deeply affected by the political climate, leading to differing opinions among its members regarding political engagement and the nature of the conflict. Some Surrealists, including Breton, supported the Republican side, which was fighting against the Nationalists led by Francisco Franco. This support was rooted in a broader leftist ideology that sought to combat fascism and promote social justice.\n\nOne notable figure who was expelled from the Surrealist movement due to his stance on the Spanish Civil War was Salvador Dal\u00ed. His perceived neutrality during the conflict and later support for Franco's regime were seen as betrayals by Breton and other Surrealists. This expulsion was not merely a personal conflict but reflected the broader ideological rifts within the movement, as many artists were grappling with their political beliefs in the face of a significant historical event.\n\nThe political divisions caused by the Spanish Civil War were not limited to the Surrealist movement; they extended to the broader leftist political landscape in Europe.

A key figure in this movement was Andr\u00e9 Breton, who played a significant role in its organization and theoretical underpinnings. During the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), the movement was divided in its political engagement, with some members supporting the Republican side while others held different views.\n\nSalvador Dal\u00ed is often cited as a notable figure who was expelled from the Surrealist movement due to his stance on the Spanish Civil War. His perceived neutrality and later support for Francisco Franco's regime were seen as betrayals by Breton and other Surrealists. This expulsion highlights the broader ideological conflicts within the movement, where political beliefs directly influenced membership and participation.\n\nTo enhance the reasoning process, we can draw from the following knowledge:\n\n1. **Political Context**: The Spanish Civil War was a significant ideological battleground, with various factions representing different political ideologies. Understanding this context helps clarify why certain views were deemed unacceptable within the Surrealist movement.\n\n2. **Internal Conflicts**: The Surrealist movement was not monolithic; it contained diverse opinions on political engagement. The expulsion of Dal\u00ed reflects the tensions between artistic freedom and political responsibility that many artists grappled with during this period.\n\n3. **Consequences of Ideological Stances**: The relationship between political beliefs and artistic movements is crucial. The expulsion of members based on their political views illustrates how ideological positions can lead to significant social and organizational changes, reinforcing the importance of political alignment within the Surrealist community.\n\n4. **Broader Implications**: The dynamics within the Surrealist movement during the Spanish Civil War serve as a case study for understanding how political events can shape artistic movements and vice versa. This understanding can be applied to analyze other historical contexts where art and politics intersect.\n\nBy synthesizing this knowledge, we can better understand the causal relationships at play and the implications of Dal\u00ed's expulsion from the Surrealist movement.\n\n### Answer:\nSalvador Dal\u00ed was expelled from the Surrealist movement due to his views on the Spanish Civil War, particularly his perceived neutrality and later support for Francisco Franco's regime, which were seen as betrayals by Andr\u00e9 Breton and other Surrealists."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nWho was expelled from the Surrealist movement due to his views on the Spanish Civil War?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['He joined the Mexican Communist Party in 1928, but was expelled in 1943 for his criticisms of the organisation\\'s bureaucratic practices and for one of the best analyses of the left in Mexico: \"Ensayo de un proletariado sin cabeza\" (Essay on a Proletariat without a Head).

Key figures included Andr\u00e9 Breton and Salvador Dal\u00ed, among others.\n\n2. **Political Engagement During the Spanish Civil War**:\n   - The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) was a significant event that divided many artists and intellectuals, including those within the Surrealist movement. Opinions on the war varied, with some surrealists supporting the Republican side while others, like Dal\u00ed, adopted a more neutral stance or even supported Franco's regime.\n\n3. **Expulsion from the Surrealist Movement**:\n   - Salvador Dal\u00ed's perceived neutrality and later support for Franco were viewed as betrayals by Breton and other Surrealists. This led to Dal\u00ed's expulsion from the movement. The reasoning behind this expulsion was not solely based on his views about the Spanish Civil War but also on his broader political affiliations and actions that conflicted with the movement's ideals.\n\n4. **Absence of Specific References in Retrieved Passages**:\n   - The retrieved passages do not explicitly identify Dal\u00ed or any other individual as being expelled from the Surrealist movement due to their views on the Spanish Civil War.
