However, the term \"notorious\" implies that these friars may have been involved in activities that were controversial or disreputable.\n\n1. **Historical Context**:\n   - The Franciscans were established in 1209, with their first presence in England recorded in 1224. This context is crucial for understanding their role in society.\n   - The order split into two branches in 1517: the Conventuals, who lived in urban settings, and the Observants, who sought a more ascetic lifestyle. This division may have influenced their activities and reputation in various locales, including Wycombe.\n\n2. **Establishment of the Brotherhood**:\n   - The \"Brotherhood of St. Francis of Wycombe,\" also known as the \"Order of Knights of West Wycombe,\" was founded in 1752 at the estate of Sir Francis Dashwood. This indicates a shift from traditional religious practices to a more secular and possibly hedonistic social club.\n   - The group later became associated with Medmenham Abbey, where their activities were characterized by extravagant and possibly controversial themes, as indicated by their motto \"Fais ce que tu voudras\" (Do what thou wilt). This motto suggests a philosophy of personal freedom that diverges from traditional Franciscan values.\n\n3. **Cultural and Social Activities**:\n   - The activities of the Brotherhood at Medmenham Abbey, including the decoration of the space with mythological and sexual themes, reflect a departure from the austere lifestyle typically associated with the Franciscans. This could have contributed to their notoriety, as they were perceived as challenging societal norms and religious conventions.\n\n4. **Suppression of Friaries**:\n   - The broader context of the suppression of Franciscan friaries during the Reformation in the 16th century highlights the tensions between religious orders and the changing political landscape. This historical backdrop may have influenced local perceptions of the friars in Wycombe, particularly if they were seen as remnants of a bygone era or as instigators of conflict.\n\n5. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - The internal divisions within the Franciscan order and the establishment of the Brotherhood illustrate how religious movements can evolve and adapt to social changes.

In 1237 a group of these monks came to Lichfield to set up home. In the town they became known as the Grey Friars because of the colour of their habits. The Bishop of Lichfield at the time, Bishop Stavenby founded the Friary when he granted the friars \u2018certain free burgages in the town for them to set their house on\u2019.\n", "Greyfriars was a Franciscan friary in Canterbury, the first friary of that order in England. The first Franciscans arrived in the country in 1224 (during the lifetime of the order's founder Francis of Assisi) and the friary was set up soon afterwards. It was dissolved in 1538 and the only surviving building of the complex is the Greyfriars Chapel, now worshipped in by Anglican Franciscans since 2003.\n", "Greyfriars is a monastic house in Bedford, England. The house of the Grey Friars (or Franciscan friars) was founded either by Mabilea de Plateshull (Lady Mabel de Pattishall) (according to Leland) or John St. John (according to \"Valor Ecclesiasticus\") during the reign of King Edward II, and their church was dedicated on 3 November 1295. The date of the arrival of the Franciscans in the town is not known. \n", "Sir Francis's club was never originally known as a Hellfire Club; it was given this name much later. His club in fact used a number of other names, such as the \"Brotherhood of St. Francis of Wy\", \"Order of Knights of West Wycombe\", \"The Order of the Friars of St Francis of Wycombe\", and later, after moving their meetings to Medmenham Abbey, they became the \"Monks\" or \"Friars of Medmenham\". The first meeting at Sir Francis's family home in West Wycombe was held on \"Walpurgis Night\", 1752; a much larger meeting, it was something of a failure and no large-scale meetings were held there again. In 1751, Dashwood, leased Medmenham Abbey on the Thames from a friend, Francis Duffield. On moving into the Abbey, Dashwood had numerous expensive works done on the building. It was rebuilt by the architect Nicholas Revett in the style of the 18th-century Gothic revival. At this time, the motto \"Fais ce que tu voudras\" was placed above a doorway in stained glass. It is thought that William Hogarth may have executed murals for this building; none, however, survive. Underneath the Abbey, Dashwood had a series of caves carved out from an existing one. It was decorated again with mythological themes, phallic symbols and other items of a sexual nature.\n", "Greyfriars, Stamford was a Franciscan friary in Lincolnshire, England. It was one of several religious houses in Stamford suppressed in the Dissolution of the Monasteries.\n", "Franciscan Friary, Winchester was a friary dedicated to St. Francis in Hampshire, England.
