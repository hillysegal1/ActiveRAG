While the passages do not explicitly state that Cole Porter wrote these songs, they are widely recognized as part of his repertoire.\n\n3. **Contextual Clues**: The mention of \"Night and Day\" alongside \"I've Got You Under My Skin\" in the context of the Great American Songbook suggests a common authorship, as both songs are often associated with Cole Porter.\n\n### Analysis of Impact on Causal Reasoning and Logical Inference:\n1. **Identifying Patterns**: The model can learn to identify patterns in the way information is presented. For instance, when a specific author is mentioned alongside multiple works, it can infer that the author likely has a broader body of work that includes those titles.\n\n2. **Contextual Associations**: By recognizing that songs are often categorized together (like those in the Great American Songbook), the model can improve its ability to make logical connections between related concepts, enhancing its reasoning capabilities.\n\n3. **Causal Relationships**: The passages provide a clear causal relationship between Cole Porter and the songs mentioned. Understanding that a composer is responsible for multiple works allows the model to make inferences about authorship based on partial information.\n\n4. **Inference from Implicit Information**: The model can learn to infer information that is not explicitly stated. For example, even though \"I Get a Kick out of You\" is not mentioned directly in the passages, the association with Cole Porter through the other songs allows for a logical inference about its authorship.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe extracted content emphasizes the importance of recognizing authorship and the relationships between works.

This is confirmed by multiple passages that explicitly mention Cole Porter as the writer of \"I've Got You Under My Skin\" and suggest his authorship of the other songs.\n\n3. **Confirm the Connection**:\n   - The passages indicate that \"I've Got You Under My Skin\" is a signature song of Cole Porter, and the other songs are also recognized as part of his repertoire. The mention of these songs in the context of the \"Great American Songbook\" further solidifies their association with Porter.\n\n4. **Utilize Contextual Clues**:\n   - The grouping of these songs together in discussions about American standards suggests a common authorship. This contextual association enhances the inference that they are all likely written by the same composer, in this case, Cole Porter.\n\n5. **Causal Relationships and Implicit Information**:\n   - The passages provide a clear causal relationship between Cole Porter and the songs mentioned. Understanding that a composer is responsible for multiple works allows the model to make inferences about authorship based on partial information. Even if some songs are not explicitly mentioned in every passage, their association with Cole Porter through other songs allows for logical inference.\n\n6. **Pattern Recognition**:\n   - The model can learn to identify patterns in the way information is presented, such as recognizing that when a specific author is mentioned alongside multiple works, it is likely that the author has a broader body of work that includes those titles.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe enhanced reasoning process emphasizes the importance of recognizing authorship and the relationships between works.
