The reporting of this incident was crucial in bringing the truth to light and influencing public perception of the Vietnam War.\n\n1. **Identifying the Journalist**:\n   - The first journalist to report on the My Lai massacre was Seymour Hersh. His investigative work began with a phone call on October 22, 1969, which led him to conduct extensive interviews with members of the Charlie Company, the unit involved in the massacre. On November 12, 1969, he published his findings, which marked the beginning of widespread media coverage of the event.\n\n2. **Impact of Reporting**:\n   - Hersh's report was significant not only for its content but also for its timing. It came at a moment when public sentiment was already shifting against the Vietnam War. His revelations prompted outrage and condemnation, contributing to a broader anti-war movement in the United States.\n\n3. **Role of Other Journalists**:\n   - While Hersh is credited with breaking the story, other journalists also played important roles in disseminating information about the massacre.

This highlights the critical role of media in shaping societal responses to governmental actions.\n\n6. **Whistleblowing and Investigative Journalism**:\n   - The involvement of whistleblowers like Ridenhour underscores the importance of individual actions in prompting investigative journalism.
