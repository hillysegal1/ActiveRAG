These conventions were significant milestones in the development of international humanitarian law.\n\n2. **Hague Convention of 1899**: This convention included several key agreements:\n   - **Convention II**: On the Laws and Customs of War on Land, which outlines rules for the conduct of hostilities, including the treatment of combatants and non-combatants.\n   - **Declaration III**: Specifically prohibits the use of bullets that easily expand or flatten in the body, reflecting an early effort to regulate the types of weapons used in warfare for humanitarian reasons.\n\n3. **Hague Convention of 1907**: This convention built upon the earlier framework and included:\n   - **Convention I**: Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, which further elaborates on the conduct of hostilities and the protection of civilians.\n   - **Convention IV**: Relative to the Laws and Customs of War at Sea, which addresses the conduct of naval warfare.\n   - **Hague IX**: Specifically regulates bombardment by naval forces, which is crucial for understanding the use of weapons in maritime conflict.\n\n4. **Focus on Weapons**: Both conventions address the types of weapons permissible in warfare and set forth prohibitions against inhumane methods of warfare. The 1899 convention's prohibition of certain types of ammunition and the 1907 convention's regulations on bombardment highlight the evolving understanding of humanitarian considerations in warfare.\n\n5. **Historical Context**: The treaties emerged in a period marked by increasing international cooperation and a growing recognition of the need to protect non-combatants and regulate the conduct of war. They reflect a foundational shift towards formalizing the laws of war, which would later influence subsequent treaties and conventions.\n\n### Answer:\nThe international treaties of 1899 and 1907 that cover the use of weapons in war are the **Hague Conventions**. Specifically, the **Hague Convention II of 1899** addresses the laws and customs of war on land, including prohibitions on certain types of ammunition, while the **Hague Convention I of 1907** elaborates on these laws and includes provisions regarding the conduct of hostilities on land and at sea, as well as regulations on naval bombardment (Hague IX).

Specifically, the Hague Convention II of 1899 addresses the laws and customs of war on land, including prohibitions on certain types of weaponry, such as expanding bullets. The Hague Convention I of 1907 further elaborates on the laws and customs of war on land and includes provisions regarding the treatment of civilians and combatants. Additionally, the Hague Convention IX of 1907 specifically addresses bombardment by naval forces in time of war. These treaties collectively establish foundational rules for the conduct of warfare and the use of weapons."}], "question_info": {"question": "Which international treaties of 1899 and 1907 cover the use of weapons in war?", "passages": ["International law relating to aerial bombardment before and during World War II rests on the treaties of 1864, 1899, and 1907, which constituted the definition of most of the laws of war at that time \u2014 which, despite repeated diplomatic attempts, was not updated in the immediate run up to World War II. The most relevant of these treaties is the Hague Convention of 1907 because it was the last treaty ratified before 1939 which specify the laws of war regarding the use of bombardment. In the Hague Convention of 1907, there are two which have a direct bearing on this issue of bombardment. These are \"Laws of War: Laws and Customs of War on Land (Hague IV); 18 October 1907\" and \"Laws of War: Bombardment by Naval Forces in Time of War (Hague IX); 18 October 1907\". It is significant that there is a different treaty which should be invoked for bombardment of land by land (Hague IV) and of land by sea (Hague IX). Hague IV, which reaffirmed and updated Hague II (1899), contains the following clauses:\n", "The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 were one of the first multi-country treaties to agree on rights for non-combatants. These meetings occurred in 1899 and in 1907. Three treaties were signed and put into effect in 1899, including the treatment of prisoners of war and the protection of hospital ships. In 1907 thirteen additional treaties were signed. These cover regulations concerning war on land, the declaration of war, the rights and responsibilities of neutral countries, and rights and restrictions during naval war.\n", "International law has prohibited the use of chemical weapons since 1899, under the Hague Convention: Article 23 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land adopted by the First Hague Conference \"especially\" prohibited employing \"poison and poisoned arms\". A separate declaration stated that in any war between signatory powers, the parties would abstain from using projectiles \"the object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases\".\n", "Participants in the international Hague Peace Conferences used Lieber's text as the basis for negotiations which resulted in the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. These two international agreements set forth laws of land and naval warfare. Subsequently, during World War I and World War II, many of these laws were broken. Following World War II, jurists at the Nuremberg Trials and the Tokyo Trials ruled that by 1939 the rules for armed conflicts, particularly those concerning belligerent and neutral nationals, had been recognized by all civilized nations and thus could apply to officials even of countries that never signed the Hague Conventions. Some features of the Lieber Code are still evident in the Geneva Conventions of 1949.\n", "The Hague Convention of 1899, Declaration III, prohibited the use in \"international warfare\" of bullets that easily expand or flatten in the body.\n", "On 20 October 1868 the first, unsuccessful, attempt to expand the 1864 treaty was undertaken. With the 'Additional Articles relating to the Condition of the Wounded in War' an attempt was initiated to clarify some rules of the 1864 convention and to extend them to maritime warfare. The Articles were signed but was only ratified by the Netherlands and North America. The Netherlands later withdrew their ratification. The protection of the victims of maritime warfare would later be realized by the third Hague Convention of 1899 and the tenth Hague Convention of 1907.\n", "BULLET::::- 1899 \u2013 International Convention for Adapting to Maritime Warfare the Principles of the Geneva Convention of 22 August 1864 [Hague III] (The Hague, 29 July 1899)\n", "BULLET::::- Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, among the first formal statements of the laws of war and war crimes in international law, signed July 1899 and October 1907\n", "BULLET::::- Geneva Conventions, for the humanitarian treatment of war (1864, 1906, 1929, 1949)\n", "BULLET::::- 1910 \u2013 International Convention respecting Bombardments by Naval Forces in Time of War [Hague IX]\n"], "__answers__": ["Hague Conventions", "Hague Convention", "hague convention", "Hague conventions", "The Hague Convention", "Hague convention", "haig convention", "hague convention disambiguation", "hague conventions", "Hague Convention (disambiguation)", "Haig convention"]}}
