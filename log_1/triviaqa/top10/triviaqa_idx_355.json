This lack of accountability reflects the political climate of the time and the complexities of international relations, particularly in the post-Soviet context.\n\n4. **Historical Context**:\n   - The Gordon Bennett Cup has a history of both triumphs and tragedies, with previous incidents, such as the 1923 race where American officers faced disaster. This historical backdrop emphasizes the inherent risks of ballooning competitions and the international nature of the event.\n\n### Integration of Contextual Relationships:\n\nThe incident on September 12, 1995, is not just a standalone event; it is part of a broader narrative surrounding the Gordon Bennett Cup and international ballooning competitions. The geopolitical implications of the incident, particularly the nationality of the victims and the response from the Belarusian government, highlight the tensions that can arise in international sporting events. The historical significance of the Gordon Bennett Cup, coupled with the tragic outcomes of this specific race, underscores the risks involved in such competitions and the need for clear communication and cooperation between participating nations.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nIn summary, the race that took place on 12 September 1995, during which the Belarusian air force shot down a gas balloon, was for the **Gordon Bennett Cup**. This answer reflects a comprehensive understanding of the incident within its historical and geopolitical context, emphasizing the complexities and risks associated with international ballooning competitions. \n\n**Answer**: Gordon Bennett Cup"}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nOn 12 September 1995, the Belarusian air force shot down a gas balloon, killing two Americans, during a race for which trophy?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['On September 12, 1995, three gas balloons participating in the race entered Belarusian air space.

The balloon had been specially constructed in France for this race and was owned by Major James C. McCoy. During the flight they took watches of three hours each, \"one sleeping and one watching the statiscopes, aneroid, and other instruments\" (sic). A recording barograph (altimeter) kept a precise log of their altitude during the flight. They reached altitudes of 5,000 meters (16400\u00a0ft) above the altitude of St. Louis, their 0 altitude reference point. St. Louis is at 140 meters (465\u00a0ft) above sea level. 46 hours later, at 3:45\u00a0p.m. on Wednesday, 19 October they landed in the middle of the wilderness in Quebec, Canada, about north of Chicoutimi. They had been forced to land because of a storm. They were on a hillside at some altitude and had traveled 1887.6 kilometers (1,173\u00a0mi) from St. Louis. They had traveled at an average of 50 kilometres per hour (30 miles per hour). The next day they traveled south towards the last inhabited area they had passed over. Hawley was slowed by an ankle twisted just after landing. For the next three days they walked, sleeping under their blankets at night and eating a bare minimum of food. They eventually came upon a trapper's hut, at the edge of Lake St. John, which was not occupied at that moment. They rested there for a day, after which two French Canadian men out on a hunting trip arrived and agreed to help them. The trappers took them to Saint-Ambroise-de-Kildare, Quebec. Once there, they sent telegrams to family and the Aero Club to let them know they were alright. The message Hawley sent to his brother read: \"Landed in wilderness week ago, fifty miles north of Chicoutimi. Both well \u2014Alan.\" Their telegrams ended searches which had various parties had started, looking for them around the Great Lakes. Clifford B.
