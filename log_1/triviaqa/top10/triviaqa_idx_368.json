In the book \"Madonna\\'s Drowned Worlds\" the use of Catholic imagery in the video is discussed. Author Santiago Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez points out that unlike Madonna\\'s previous music videos, much of the religious imagery is associated with the torero, not Madonna, due to the fact that religious images are a strong part of the bullfighting ritual. It has also been argued that in the video Madonna \"subverts the gender structure and masculine subjectivity implicit in traditional bullfighting.\" This is achieved through the \"feminization of the matador and the emphasis on Madonna\\'s character\" and also through Madonna\\'s \"dominant gaze\" as she watches the matador perform.\"\\n', 'The music video, directed by Mary Lambert, portrays Madonna as a witness to the murder of a girl by white supremacists. While a black man is arrested for the murder, Madonna hides in a church for safety, seeking strength to go forth as a witness. The clip depicts a church and Catholic symbols such as stigmata. It also features a Ku Klux Klan-style cross burning, and a dream about kissing a black saint. The Vatican condemned the video, while family and religious groups protested against its broadcast.

The company canceled their sponsorship contract with Madonna, but allowed her to retain the fee.\\n', 'In January 1989, Madonna signed an endorsement deal with soft-drink manufacturer, Pepsi. In one of her Pepsi commercials, she debuted \"Like a Prayer\", the lead single from her fourth studio album of same name.

Religious groups sought to ban the commercial and boycott Pepsi products. Pepsi revoked the commercial and canceled her sponsorship contract. \"Like a Prayer\" topped the charts in many countries, becoming her seventh number one on the Hot 100.\\n', 'The Latinos in the video are portrayed as stereotypes as nonchalant people, unemployed adults, school deprived children and a crumbling \"barrio\". However, the music video was critically appreciated in many quarters for its utilization of Hispanic fashion as an icon of beauty and romanticism. Collen McDanell, in his book \"Material Christianity\", noted Madonna\\'s use of Catholic objects in the video like the candlestands and home shrines, thereby giving them a new meaning according to her own. Author Douglas Kellner noted, \"such \\'multiculturalism\\' and her culturally transgressive moves turned out to be highly successful moves that endeared her to large and varied youth audiences\".

According to him, Madonna deliberately appropriated traditional feminine images in the beginning of the video, but contrasted them with her \"crotch-hugging\" male poses near the end, and discordant images of women assuming the male position.

In the book \"Madonna's Drowned Worlds\" the use of Catholic imagery in the video is discussed. Author Santiago Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez points out that unlike Madonna's previous music videos, much of the religious imagery is associated with the torero, not Madonna, due to the fact that religious images are a strong part of the bullfighting ritual. It has also been argued that in the video Madonna \"subverts the gender structure and masculine subjectivity implicit in traditional bullfighting.\" This is achieved through the \"feminization of the matador and the emphasis on Madonna's character\" and also through Madonna's \"dominant gaze\" as she watches the matador perform.\"\n", "The music video, directed by Mary Lambert, portrays Madonna as a witness to the murder of a girl by white supremacists. While a black man is arrested for the murder, Madonna hides in a church for safety, seeking strength to go forth as a witness. The clip depicts a church and Catholic symbols such as stigmata. It also features a Ku Klux Klan-style cross burning, and a dream about kissing a black saint. The Vatican condemned the video, while family and religious groups protested against its broadcast. They boycotted products by soft drink manufacturer Pepsi, who had used the song in their commercial. The company canceled their sponsorship contract with Madonna, but allowed her to retain the fee.\n", "In January 1989, Madonna signed an endorsement deal with soft-drink manufacturer, Pepsi. In one of her Pepsi commercials, she debuted \"Like a Prayer\", the lead single from her fourth studio album of same name. The corresponding music video featured many Catholic symbols such as stigmata and cross burning, and a dream of making love to a saint, leading the Vatican to condemn the video. Religious groups sought to ban the commercial and boycott Pepsi products. Pepsi revoked the commercial and canceled her sponsorship contract. \"Like a Prayer\" topped the charts in many countries, becoming her seventh number one on the Hot 100.\n", "The Latinos in the video are portrayed as stereotypes as nonchalant people, unemployed adults, school deprived children and a crumbling \"barrio\". However, the music video was critically appreciated in many quarters for its utilization of Hispanic fashion as an icon of beauty and romanticism. Collen McDanell, in his book \"Material Christianity\", noted Madonna's use of Catholic objects in the video like the candlestands and home shrines, thereby giving them a new meaning according to her own. Author Douglas Kellner noted, \"such 'multiculturalism' and her culturally transgressive moves turned out to be highly successful moves that endeared her to large and varied youth audiences\". Madonna's Andalusian look in the video became popular and appeared in the fashion trends at that time in the form of boleros and layered skirts accessorizing with rosary beads and crucifix like the video.\n", "Theorist Douglas Kellner further asserted that the video was a feminist critique of male fighting and brutality, with images of the male workers engaged in a boxing match at the end. According to him, Madonna deliberately appropriated traditional feminine images in the beginning of the video, but contrasted them with her \"crotch-hugging\" male poses near the end, and discordant images of women assuming the male position. As feminist author Susan Bordo pointed out, \"it is the postmodern nature of the video that has most entranced academic critics, and its various ways of constituting identities that refuse stability, that remain fluid, that resist definition.\" At the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards, \"Express Yourself\" was nominated in the categories of Best Female Video, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Direction and Best Art Direction, winning the last three categories. \"Billboard\" also honored the video as the Best Music Video of the year, at their Music Video Awards for 1989. The music video of \"Express Yourself\" is ranked at number one on Slant Magazine's \"100 Greatest Music Videos\". It is also placed at number ten on both \"Rolling Stone\"'s \"The 100 Top Music Videos\" and MTV's \"100 Greatest Videos Ever Made\", as well as number three on MuchMusic's list of \"Top 100 Videos of The Century\". David Dale from \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" listed it as one of the Most Influential Videos of All Time, at number 18. \"Time\" magazine listed it at number eight on their countdown of The 30-All Time Best Music Videos.\n", "The accompanying music video portrayed Madonna as a woman walking in a hotel hallway, looking distressed and tired from work, until being seduced into having sex with a mysterious man and woman. It caused controversy worldwide, due to its explicit sexual images, and was subsequently banned from MTV and other TV networks. The video, which contained imagery of sadomasochism, voyeurism, and bisexuality, made its US television debut December 3, 1990 on ABC during its late-night news program \"Nightline\". The song was part of the setlist of three of her concert tours, the most recent being The MDNA Tour in 2012.\n", "The eight-minute music video, released on June 26, 2019, was directed by Jonas \u00c5kerlund, who worked with Madonna in several of her music videos since 1998, and features drag queen Mon\u00e9t X Change, Hollywood actress Sofia Boutella, and YouTuber Gigi Gorgeous. The video proceeds a time reversal. The opening scene of the video shows a gunman shooting down Madonna and other people in a nightclub, who fall to the ground covered in blood. In a later scene, protesters are shown holding signs criticizing the National Rifle Association. The video concludes with the captions \"No one is safe\" and \"Gun Control. Now\".\n", "The tour was met with strong reaction from religious groups for her performance of \"Like a Virgin\", during which two male dancers caressed her body before she simulated masturbation. The Church of England and the Catholic Church criticised her performance and the Pope asked the general public and the Christian community not to attend the concert. A private association of Catholics calling themselves \"Famiglia Domani\" also boycotted the tour for its eroticism. In response, Madonna said, \"The tour in no way hurts anybody's sentiments. It's for open minds and gets them to see sexuality in a different way. Their own and others'.\"\n", "The video features Madonna in a stylized recording studio singing the song with back up singers. The video was compared to the music video of Madonna's single \"Rain\" (1993). Her look in the video, consists of blue-black icy hair, bright blue eyes and a long dark dress with a beaded necklace around her neck. Madonna's face was mainly shot above her head, with her face looking up just ahead of the camera focus. Sometimes she looks to a video screen behind her which plays the scenes from the film, as if to take inspiration for her singing. Other times she is accompanied by her back-up singers, mainly during the chorus, and sometimes she sings alone.\n", "Academics noted that with her videos, Madonna was subtly reversing the usual role of male as the dominant sex. This symbolism and imagery was probably the most prevalent in the music video for \"Like a Prayer\". The video included scenes of an African-American church choir, Madonna being attracted to a statue of a black saint, and singing in front of burning crosses. This mix of the sacred and the profane upset the Vatican and resulted in the Pepsi commercial withdrawal. In 2003, MTV named her \"The Greatest Music Video Star Ever\" and said that \"Madonna's innovation, creativity and contribution to the music video art form is what won her the award.\"\n"], "__answers__": ["Like a Prayer", "\"\"\"Like a Prayer\"\"\"", "like prayer", "Like A Prayer", "Like a Prayer (disambiguation)", "like prayer disambiguation"]}}
