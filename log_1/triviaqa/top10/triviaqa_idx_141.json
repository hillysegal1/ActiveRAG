This indicates that Warren is indeed a character in a comedy series.\n\n3. **Character \"McLaren\"**: The name \"McLaren\" appears in a passage discussing a telemovie featuring Colin McLaren, but it does not relate to a comedy series. Therefore, we cannot confirm that McLaren is a character in a comedy based on the provided passages.\n\n4. **Character \"Blanco\"**: There is no mention of a character named \"Blanco\" in any of the passages. This absence suggests that this character may not be part of any of the referenced shows or may not be relevant to the question.\n\n5. **Absence of Direct Connections**: Since the passages do not provide a clear connection between McLaren, Blanco, and Warren in a single TV comedy, we conclude that the characters may not all belong to the same show.\n\n6. **Conclusion from Available Information**: Based on the information extracted, we can confirm that \"Warren\" is a character in the sitcom \"Warren.\" However, we cannot definitively identify a TV comedy that includes all three characters (McLaren, Blanco, and Warren) based on the provided passages.\n\n### Answer:\nThe TV comedy is \"Warren,\" but there is no evidence from the passages to confirm that McLaren and Blanco are characters in the same show.
