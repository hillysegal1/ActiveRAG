In the final, Zola Budd, representing Great Britain, had been intentionally running barefoot side by side with Decker for three laps and moved ahead. In an attempt to put pressure on Budd, Decker remained close by in a crowded space. Decker stood on Budd, then shortly after, collided with the barefoot runner and fell spectacularly to the curb, injuring the hip. As a result, Mary Decker did not finish the race, which was won by Maricica Puica of Romania (Budd finished seventh). Decker was carried off the track in tears by her boyfriend (and later, husband), British discus thrower Richard Slaney. At a press conference she said that Budd was to blame for the collision. While it is generally the trailing athlete's responsibility to avoid contact with the runner ahead, it is also an accepted convention among most distance runners that the leader be a full stride ahead before cutting in. International track officials initially disqualified Budd for obstruction, but she was reinstated just one hour later once officials had viewed films of the race. Despite being behind Budd, Decker's claim that Budd had bumped into her leg was supported by a number of sports journalists.

This outcome highlights the impact of the collision on both athletes' performances.\n\n4. **Disqualification and Reinstatement**: The initial disqualification of Budd for obstruction and her subsequent reinstatement after a review of the race footage adds depth to the understanding of the incident and the differing perspectives on accountability.\n\n5. **Media Representation**: The media's portrayal of the race as a duel between Budd and Decker often overshadowed the performance of other competitors, such as Maricica Puic\u0103, who won the race. This context is essential for understanding how the event was framed in public discourse.\n\n6. **Reflections from Decker**: Decker's later acknowledgment of her inexperience in running in a pack and her belief that Budd did not trip her deliberately provide additional nuance to the narrative, illustrating the complexities of competitive racing.\n\nBy integrating these details, I can present a more comprehensive understanding of the incident, reducing the likelihood of oversimplified or inaccurate representations.\n\n**Answer**: The women's 3000 meters final."}], "question_info": {"question": "In which race did Zola Budd and Mary Decker famously collide at the 1984 Olympics?", "passages": ["Decker was heavily favored to win a gold medal in the 3000 meters run at the 1984 Summer Olympics, held at Los Angeles. In the final, Zola Budd, representing Great Britain, had been intentionally running barefoot side by side with Decker for three laps and moved ahead. In an attempt to put pressure on Budd, Decker remained close by in a crowded space. Decker stood on Budd, then shortly after, collided with the barefoot runner and fell spectacularly to the curb, injuring the hip. As a result, Mary Decker did not finish the race, which was won by Maricica Puica of Romania (Budd finished seventh). Decker was carried off the track in tears by her boyfriend (and later, husband), British discus thrower Richard Slaney. At a press conference she said that Budd was to blame for the collision. While it is generally the trailing athlete's responsibility to avoid contact with the runner ahead, it is also an accepted convention among most distance runners that the leader be a full stride ahead before cutting in. International track officials initially disqualified Budd for obstruction, but she was reinstated just one hour later once officials had viewed films of the race. Despite being behind Budd, Decker's claim that Budd had bumped into her leg was supported by a number of sports journalists. The claim was not accepted by the director of the games or the IAAF.\n", "BULLET::::- 11 August \u2013 Barefoot runner Zola Budd and Mary Decker of the United States collide in the Olympic 3,000 meters final and neither finish as medallist.\n", "Decker and Budd next met in July 1985, in a 3000 meters race at Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in London, England. Decker won the race, and Budd finished in fourth place. After the race, the two women shook hands and made up. Decker later went on record as claiming that she was unfairly robbed of the LA 3000 meters gold medal by Budd, but said many years after the event \"The reason I fell, some people think she tripped me deliberately. I happen to know that wasn't the case at all. The reason I fell is because I am and was very inexperienced in running in a pack.\"\n", "In the 1984 Olympics, held in Los Angeles, California, the media billed the 3000 m race as a duel between Budd and world champion Mary Decker, and few reported that a third contestant, Romanian Maricica Puic\u0103, had set the fastest time that year.\n", "She competed for Canada at the 1984 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles, U.S. in the 3,000 metres where she won the bronze medal (in the race notable for the incident between Mary Decker and Zola Budd). Four years later in Seoul, South Korea she finished fifth in the 1500 metres.\n", "From the gun, Decker went to the front, with Puic\u0103 a metre back. Starting slower, Budd ran through the field to assume her position on Decker's shoulder 200 metres into the race. They ran in the same formation for three laps. With four laps to go, Wendy Sly moved forward to challenge for the lead next to Budd. Coming of the turn, Budd moved toward the curb. Decker stood on her, then shortly after, collided with the British runner and fell spectacularly to the curb, injuring the hip. As a result, Mary Decker did not finish the race. Decker was carried off the track in tears by her boyfriend (and later, husband), British discus thrower Richard Slaney. Puic\u0103 rushed around Budd into the lead, with Sly on her shoulder as the bewildered Budd lost ground for a moment. But Budd ran around Puic\u0103 and Sly to again take the lead. Deeper in the pack, somehow Brigitte Kraus also fell into the infield and out of the race. With a lap and a half to go, Sly again edged her way around Budd and into the lead. While Sly and Budd wore the same uniform, they were essentially strangers and there was no effort to cooperate tactically. Puic\u0103 followed Sly around Budd and with 500 metres to go. Sly took the bell with Puic\u0103 on her shoulder. With 250 metres to go, Puic\u0103 passed Sly and went into her finishing kick, separating from Sly. Lynn Williams caught Budd and moved into third position. Budd continued to fall back through the field as the other athletes were launching their finishing kicks. Puic\u0103 extended her lead over Sly, Williams even further back in third. Budd fizzled into seventh place. Out of 12 starters, 4 had fallen during the race, with two not finishing. As Puic\u0103 crossed the finishing line, with Sly some 15 meters behind, she clearly appeared to have had more to give, if it had been necessary. \n", "At 1700 metres, the first collision occurred. Decker came into contact with one of Budd's legs, knocking Budd slightly off balance. However, both women maintained their close position. Five strides on, at race time of 4:58, Budd and Decker again made contact, with Budd's left foot brushing Decker's thigh, causing Budd to lose her balance and sending her into Decker's path. Decker's spiked running shoe came down hard into Budd's ankle, just above the heel, which drew blood. Videotapes later examined by Olympic officials showed Budd visibly in pain. However, Budd maintained equilibrium and kept stride.\n", "Zola Pieterse (\"n\u00e9e\" Budd; born 26 May 1966) is a middle-distance and long-distance runner. She competed at the 1984 Olympic Games for Great Britain and the 1992 Olympic Games for South Africa, both times in the 3000 metres. In 1984 (unratified) and 1985, she broke the world record in the women's 5000 metres. She was also a two-time winner at the World Cross Country Championships (1985\u20131986). Budd's career was unusual in that she mainly trained and raced barefoot. She moved with her family to South Carolina in 2008, and competes at marathons and ultramarathons. She volunteers as assistant coach at Coastal Carolina University in Conway. Her mile best of 4:17.57 in 1985, still stands as the British record.\n", "Decker had a successful 1985 season, winning twelve mile and 3000 meters races in the European athletics calendar, which included a new official world record for the women's mile of 4:16.71 in Zurich (Natalya Artyomova's 4:15.8 in 1984, not being ratified by the IAAF). Since that race in 1985, her time has only been bettered on four occasions. That race in Zurich also matched her with both of the other principle athletes from the Olympic race, Slaney vanquishing both Puica and Budd who themselves ran times that until July 9, 2017 also ranked in the top 10 of all time.\n", "Decker stood on Budd, then shortly after, collided with the British runner and fell spectacularly to the curb, injuring her hip.
