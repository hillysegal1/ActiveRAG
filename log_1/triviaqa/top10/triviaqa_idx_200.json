This reinforces the model's understanding and prevents any potential errors in future responses.\n\n5. **Clarification**: It is important to note that while the model has identified Texas correctly, explicitly stating that Texas is the state nearest the end of the alphabet can help alleviate any model illusions regarding alphabetical order and Gulf Coast states.\n\n**Answer**: Texas"}], "question_info": {"question": "Which state on the Gulf of Mexico is nearest the end of the alphabet?", "passages": ["Publication editorial and coverage included the five states that border the Gulf of Mexico: Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.\n", "The Gulf of Mexico () is an ocean basin and a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean, largely surrounded by the North American continent.
