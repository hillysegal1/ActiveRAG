The term \"Coleoptera\" refers to the order of insects commonly known as beetles. Therefore, coleopterology specifically focuses on the study of beetles, which are characterized by their hardened forewings (elytra) that cover their flying wings. \n\nFrom the retrieved passages, we can further enhance our understanding of coleopterology with the following points:\n\n1. **Definition of Coleopterology**: \n   - Coleopterology is defined as the scientific study of beetles of the order Coleoptera. This is supported by multiple passages, confirming that it is a branch of entomology focused on beetles.\n\n2. **Practitioners**: \n   - Individuals who study coleopterology are referred to as coleopterists. This term is explicitly mentioned in the passages, indicating the specific nomenclature used within this field.\n\n3. **Organizations**: \n   - There are dedicated organizations for coleopterists, such as The Coleopterists Society, which facilitates the study and collaboration among those interested in beetles. This highlights the community aspect of coleopterology.\n\n4. **Informal Terminology**: \n   - Coleopterists sometimes informally refer to their study as \"beetling.\" This informal term may not be widely recognized outside the community but is relevant for understanding the culture within the field.\n\n5. **Broader Context**: \n   - While coleopterology primarily focuses on beetles, it is important to note that it also includes the study of weevils, which are a specific type of beetle. This broadens the scope of what is considered within the field of coleopterology.\n\nBy integrating this information, we can clarify that coleopterology is not only the study of beetles but also encompasses weevils, and it is practiced by individuals known as coleopterists who may engage in informal discussions about their work using the term \"beetling.\" \n\n**Answer**: Coleopterology is the study of beetles, including weevils, and is practiced by individuals known as coleopterists."}], "question_info": {"question": "Coleopterology is the study of which insects?", "passages": ["Coleopterology (from Coleoptera and Greek , \"-logia\") is a branch of entomology, the scientific study of beetles of the order Coleoptera.
