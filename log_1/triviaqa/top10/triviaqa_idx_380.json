Dahl replied in the February 1973 issue of Horn Book. He wrote that Cameron was entitled to her opinion about his book, but he felt that she had attacked his character as well. He also scoffed at her recommendation that teachers find better literature to share with their students: \"I would dearly like to see Ms. Cameron trying to read \"Little Women\", or \"Robinson Crusoe\" for that matter to a class of today's children.
