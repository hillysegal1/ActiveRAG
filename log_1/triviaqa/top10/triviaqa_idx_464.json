The term translates to \"the doorway to the Guru,\" indicating a direct connection to Sikhism, a monotheistic religion that originated in the Punjab region of India in the 15th century. \n\n1. **Definition and Meaning**: A gurdwara is specifically defined as the Sikh place of worship, serving not only as a temple but also as a community center where congregational worship occurs. The Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of Sikhism, is central to the worship practices within a gurdwara.\n\n2. **Cultural Significance**: Gurdwaras are integral to Sikh community life, often hosting significant events and gatherings. For example, the Harmandir Sahib, also known as the Golden Temple, is one of the most revered gurdwaras and symbolizes the spiritual heart of Sikhism.\n\n3. **Geographical Presence**: Gurdwaras are found globally, including in countries such as India, Canada, and the United States. This widespread presence reflects the diaspora of the Sikh community and the adaptability of their religious practices in diverse cultural contexts.\n\n4. **Community Role**: Beyond worship, gurdwaras function as community hubs, organizing events like the annual Khalsa Day parade, which fosters community cohesion and cultural identity among Sikhs. This highlights the role of gurdwaras in promoting social dynamics and community spirit.\n\n5. **Historical Connections**: The historical significance of gurdwaras, tied to key figures such as Guru Nanak, enhances our understanding of their role in the evolution of Sikhism. Recognizing these connections allows for a deeper appreciation of how historical narratives shape contemporary religious practices.\n\nBy synthesizing this information, we can conclude that the gurdwara is a multifaceted institution within Sikhism, serving both spiritual and communal purposes. This understanding enhances our ability to reason about the relationship between religious practices and community identity, as well as the broader implications of religious institutions in society.\n\n### Answer:\nSikhism"}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nIn which religion is the temple, or place of worship, known as the gurdwara?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['A gurdwara (, \\' or , \\', meaning \"the doorway to the Guru\") is the Sikh place of worship and may be referred to as a Sikh temple.\\n', 'A gurdwara (; meaning \"door to the guru\") is a place of assembly and worship for Sikhs.\\n', 'A gurudwara (Punjabi: \u0a17\u0a41\u0a30\u0a26\u0a41\u0a06\u0a30\u0a3e, gurdu\u0101r\u0101 or \u0a17\u0a41\u0a30\u0a26\u0a35\u0a3e\u0a30\u0a3e, gurdw\u0101r\u0101; sometimes transliterated from Punjabi as gurdwara), meaning \"the doorway to the guru\", is a place of worship for Sikhs.
