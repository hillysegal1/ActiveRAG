This agreement, signed in 1985, established the Schengen Area, which allows for the free movement of people across member states without the need for passport checks at internal borders. \n\n1. **Historical Context**:\n   - The Schengen Agreement was initiated due to the need for easier cross-border travel and trade among European nations. It was signed by five of the ten EU member states at the time: Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany. This historical context is crucial for understanding the motivations behind the agreement.\n\n2. **Expansion and Membership**:\n   - Over the years, the Schengen Area has expanded to include 22 of the 28 EU member states and four EFTA members (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland). This expansion reflects the growing integration of European countries and the desire to facilitate movement and commerce.\n\n3. **Implementation Challenges**:\n   - The Schengen Agreement has faced challenges, such as the temporary re-imposition of border controls in response to crises (e.g., the migrant crisis in 2015). This aspect highlights the dynamic nature of international agreements and the need for flexibility in response to changing circumstances.\n\n4. **Legal Framework and Governance**:\n   - The governance of the Schengen Area is primarily under the jurisdiction of the EU, which has the authority to legislate on border crossing policies. However, certain countries, like Ireland and the UK, opted out of the Schengen Agreement, maintaining their own arrangements (the Common Travel Area). This illustrates the complexity of international agreements and the varying degrees of participation among countries.\n\n5. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - The signing of the Schengen Agreement directly led to the abolition of passport controls among member states, establishing a precedent for future agreements aimed at enhancing cooperation and mobility. Understanding this causal relationship is essential for recognizing how treaties can influence national policies and international relations.\n\n6. **Broader Implications**:\n   - The Schengen Agreement not only facilitates travel but also has significant implications for trade, security, and social interactions among member states. By understanding these broader implications, we can infer the potential impacts of similar agreements in other regions or contexts.\n\n### Answer:\nThe agreement under which passport controls have been abolished in 22 EU and 4 non-EU states is the **Schengen Agreement**."}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nWhat is the name of the agreement under which passport controls have been abolished in 22 EU and 4 non-EU states?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['The Nordic Passport Union was established in three stages.

Passport checks for citizens of non-member countries at the borders between member countries were removed by a treaty between Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland signed on 12 July 1957 and which came into force on 1 May 1958.
