Their marriage was politically motivated, aimed at consolidating power and claims to the English throne during a tumultuous period in English history. Jane's reign was short-lived, lasting only nine days before she was deposed and subsequently executed.\n\nHowever, recent passages retrieved suggest additional information that could potentially update or complicate the understanding of Lady Jane Grey's marital history:\n\n1. **George Drummond Passage**: \n   - The claim that \"Lady Jane Grey (d. June 1752), who married in June 1738, George Drummond, 3rd of Blair Drummond\" introduces a significant contradiction to the established historical narrative. This suggests that there may have been another Lady Jane Grey who lived much later and had a different marital history.\n\n2. **Ogle Family Connection**: \n   - The mention of Lady Jane Grey marrying into the Ogle family raises questions about her connections and potential marriages, indicating that there may be confusion with other individuals named Jane Grey.\n\n3. **Sir Edward Greville Passage**: \n   - The reference to \"Sir Edward Greville, who married Jane Grey\" could imply that there were other marriages involving women named Jane Grey, which may lead to further confusion regarding Lady Jane Grey's identity and marital history.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTo prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions, it is essential to clarify that the Lady Jane Grey commonly referred to in historical texts is distinct from any other individuals named Jane Grey mentioned in the retrieved passages. The model should maintain the established fact that Lady Jane Grey was married to Lord Guildford Dudley in 1553 while acknowledging the existence of other individuals with similar names and their respective histories.\n\n### Answer:\nLady Jane Grey, often referred to as the \"Nine Days' Queen,\" was married to Lord Guildford Dudley in May 1553. Their marriage was part of a political alliance aimed at strengthening their claim to the English throne. However, it is important to note that there are references to other individuals named Jane Grey, including a claim that a Lady Jane Grey married George Drummond in 1738, which pertains to a different historical context. Therefore, the historically recognized husband of Lady Jane Grey is Lord Guildford Dudley."}], "question_info": {"question": "Who was the husband of Lady Jane Grey?", "passages": ["BULLET::::- Lady Jane Grey (d.
