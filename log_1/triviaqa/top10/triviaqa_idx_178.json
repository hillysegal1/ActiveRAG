This social dimension differentiates MMORPGs from other gaming genres and highlights their role in fostering community.\n\n7. **Synthesis of Insights**: By integrating the definition, historical context, contributions of key figures, and the social aspect, we can form a comprehensive understanding of MMORPGs. This synthesis reflects the genre's complexity and its significance in the broader landscape of video gaming.\n\n### Final Answer:\nMMORPG stands for \"Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game.\" It is a genre of online games that allows a large number of players to interact in a shared virtual world, where they assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. MMORPGs evolved from earlier text-based games known as MUDs and have been shaped by influential designers like Raph Koster, Brad McQuaid, Mark Jacobs, Brian Green, and J. Todd Coleman. These games are characterized by their emphasis on social interaction, allowing players to form communities and relationships that extend beyond the game itself. Notable early titles such as \"Neverwinter Nights,\" \"Ultima Online,\" and \"EverQuest\" helped establish the conventions of the genre, which includes persistent worlds, character customization, and immersive storytelling."}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nRaph Koster, Brad McQuaid, Mark Jacobs, Brian Green and J.

Indeed, before the invention of the term MMORPG, games of this style were simply called graphical MUDs. A number of influential MMORPG designers began as and/or players (such as Raph Koster, Brad McQuaid, Matt Firor, and Brian Green) or were involved with early MUDs (like Mark Jacobs and J.

The link between Garriott and the MMORPG term has been recognised by many scholars. Previous to this and related coinages, these games were generally called graphical MUDs; the history of MMORPGs traces back directly through the MUD genre. Through this connection, MMORPGs can be seen to have roots in the earliest multi-user games such as \"Mazewar\" (1974) and \"MUD1\" (1978). 1985 saw the release of a roguelike (pseudo-graphical) MUD called \"Island of Kesmai\" on CompuServe and Lucasfilm\\'s graphical MUD Habitat. The first fully graphical multi-user RPG was \"Neverwinter Nights\", which was delivered through America Online in 1991 and was personally championed by AOL President Steve Case. Other early proprietary graphical online RPGs include three on The Sierra Network: \"The Shadow of Yserbius\" in 1992, \"The Fates of Twinion\" in 1993, and \"The Ruins of Cawdor\" in 1995. Another milestone came in 1995 as NSFNET restrictions were lifted, opening the Internet up for game developers, which allowed for the first truly \"massively\"-scoped titles. Finally, MMORPGs as defined today began with \"Meridian 59\" in 1996, innovative both in its scope and in offering first-person 3D graphics, with \"The Realm Online\" appearing nearly simultaneously. \"Ultima Online\", released in 1997, is often credited with first popularizing the genre, though more mainstream attention was garnered by 1999\\'s \"EverQuest\" and \"Asheron\\'s Call\" in the West and 1996\\'s \"\" in South Korea.\\n', 'Though the vast majority of MMORPGs are produced by companies, many small teams of programmers and artists have contributed to the genre. As shown above, the average MMORPG development project requires enormous investments of time and money, and running the game can be a long-term commitment. As a result, non-corporate (or independent, or \"indie\") development of MMORPGs is less common compared to other genres.

A major disadvantage was that Fujisawa was inexperienced with working on MMORPGs. The first major developmental issue was the need in an MMORPG to have a full customizable character. Another related problem was the initial premise of an unseen force as the threat, which was unusual within the form. Fujisawa rationalized it into a kind of \"common sense\" related to the interaction between player community and necessary events within the game world that worked against accepted principles of MMORPG gameplay, which resulted in multiple staff members raising doubts as to whether the game could work. The second major issue was what types of environments to include or discard, and for this Fujisawa was prepared due to his long experience with the franchise. On top of this, the staff needed to evaluate what would work for an MMORPG in the unpredictable Japanese gaming market, which unlike other parts of the world was not a major consumer of MMORPGs. Their main object for comparison was \"World of Warcraft\", which by that time had 12 million players worldwide but only had a small holding in Japan.

The history of MMORPGs can be traced back to the MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) genre, with early games referred to as graphical MUDs. This historical context is essential for understanding the evolution of MMORPGs.\n6. Influential designers in the MMORPG genre include Raph Koster, Brad McQuaid, Mark Jacobs, Brian Green, and J. Todd Coleman. Their involvement in early MUDs and the transition to MMORPG design is significant in understanding the genre's development.\n7. Key milestones in the development of MMORPGs include \"Neverwinter Nights\" (1991) as the first fully graphical multi-user RPG, \"Meridian 59\" (1996) as the beginning of MMORPGs as defined today, and \"Ultima Online\" (1997) and \"EverQuest\" (1999) as titles that popularized the genre.\n8. Social interactions are a major component of enjoyment in MMORPGs, with players often forming lifelong friendships, highlighting the community aspect that is crucial for the genre's appeal.\n\nBy incorporating these points, the model can refine its understanding of MMORPGs, their historical context, influential figures, and the social dynamics involved in gameplay. This enhanced reasoning process helps mitigate potential inaccuracies and enriches the model's knowledge base regarding the subject.\n\n**Answer:**\nMMORPG stands for \"Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game.\" The term was coined by Richard Garriott and refers to a genre of games that allows a large number of players to participate simultaneously in a shared online environment. Players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting, engaging in quests and character development. The history of MMORPGs traces back to the MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) genre, with significant titles like \"Neverwinter Nights,\" \"Meridian 59,\" \"Ultima Online,\" and \"EverQuest\" marking key milestones in the genre's evolution. Social interactions are a major component of MMORPGs, often leading to the formation of lifelong friendships among players. Influential designers in this field include Raph Koster, Brad McQuaid, Mark Jacobs, Brian Green, and J. Todd Coleman, who have contributed significantly to the development and popularization of MMORPGs."}], "question_info": {"question": "Raph Koster, Brad McQuaid, Mark Jacobs, Brian Green and J. Todd Coleman are influential in MMORPG design. What is MMORPG?", "passages": ["The history of modern massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) like \"EverQuest\" and \"Ultima Online\", and related virtual world genres such as the social virtual worlds exemplified by \"Second Life\", can be traced directly back to the MUD genre. Indeed, before the invention of the term MMORPG, games of this style were simply called graphical MUDs. A number of influential MMORPG designers began as and/or players (such as Raph Koster, Brad McQuaid, Matt Firor, and Brian Green) or were involved with early MUDs (like Mark Jacobs and J. Todd Coleman).\n", "Many MUDs are still active and a number of influential MMORPG designers, such as Raph Koster, Brad McQuaid, Matt Firor, Mark Jacobs, Brian Green, and J. Todd Coleman, began as and/or players. The history of MMORPGs grows directly out of the history of MUDs.\n", "He helped with the design of the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) \"\" under the direction of CEO Mark Jacobs and producer Jeff Hickman.\n", "MMORPG is a term coined by Richard Garriott to refer to massive multiplayer online role-playing games and their social communities. The link between Garriott and the MMORPG term has been recognised by many scholars. Previous to this and related coinages, these games were generally called graphical MUDs; the history of MMORPGs traces back directly through the MUD genre. Through this connection, MMORPGs can be seen to have roots in the earliest multi-user games such as \"Mazewar\" (1974) and \"MUD1\" (1978). 1985 saw the release of a roguelike (pseudo-graphical) MUD called \"Island of Kesmai\" on CompuServe and Lucasfilm's graphical MUD Habitat. The first fully graphical multi-user RPG was \"Neverwinter Nights\", which was delivered through America Online in 1991 and was personally championed by AOL President Steve Case. Other early proprietary graphical online RPGs include three on The Sierra Network: \"The Shadow of Yserbius\" in 1992, \"The Fates of Twinion\" in 1993, and \"The Ruins of Cawdor\" in 1995. Another milestone came in 1995 as NSFNET restrictions were lifted, opening the Internet up for game developers, which allowed for the first truly \"massively\"-scoped titles. Finally, MMORPGs as defined today began with \"Meridian 59\" in 1996, innovative both in its scope and in offering first-person 3D graphics, with \"The Realm Online\" appearing nearly simultaneously. \"Ultima Online\", released in 1997, is often credited with first popularizing the genre, though more mainstream attention was garnered by 1999's \"EverQuest\" and \"Asheron's Call\" in the West and 1996's \"\" in South Korea.\n", "Though the vast majority of MMORPGs are produced by companies, many small teams of programmers and artists have contributed to the genre. As shown above, the average MMORPG development project requires enormous investments of time and money, and running the game can be a long-term commitment. As a result, non-corporate (or independent, or \"indie\") development of MMORPGs is less common compared to other genres. Still, many independent MMORPGs do exist, representing a wide spectrum of genres, gameplay types, and revenue systems.\n", "Jennings' website attracted many well-known MMORPG staff and developers who took part in discussions on the forums. These included Richard Garriott, Raph Koster, and Mark Jacobs. Discussions often centered around the very virtual worlds they built, with much input from the community, both constructive and negative.\n", "The change to a new genre presented multiple challenges to the team: while standard RPGs were designed around a scripted experience, MMORPGs were more reliant on a true sense of unscripted adventure. A major disadvantage was that Fujisawa was inexperienced with working on MMORPGs. The first major developmental issue was the need in an MMORPG to have a full customizable character. Another related problem was the initial premise of an unseen force as the threat, which was unusual within the form. Fujisawa rationalized it into a kind of \"common sense\" related to the interaction between player community and necessary events within the game world that worked against accepted principles of MMORPG gameplay, which resulted in multiple staff members raising doubts as to whether the game could work. The second major issue was what types of environments to include or discard, and for this Fujisawa was prepared due to his long experience with the franchise. On top of this, the staff needed to evaluate what would work for an MMORPG in the unpredictable Japanese gaming market, which unlike other parts of the world was not a major consumer of MMORPGs. Their main object for comparison was \"World of Warcraft\", which by that time had 12 million players worldwide but only had a small holding in Japan. While this appeared discouraging, there had not been many titles of similar scale and success within the country, so there was both space for and detractions against an equivalent MMORPG experience.\n", "Greg Porter's Blacksburg Tactical Research Center was one of a few game companies active in Blacksburg, Virginia in the 1980s and 1990s. Porter initially came to attention for designing \"TimeLords\" and \"Macho Women with Guns\" RPGs in the late 1980s; he then put his energy into two successive generic RPG systems, \"CORPS\" and \"EABA\".\n", "In a recent study Professor Griffiths co-wrote conducted a study with Helena Cole, a researcher in the Division of psychology Nottingham Trent University, that explored what the social interactions occur both within and outside of MMORPGs. Griffiths and Cole both conducted an experiment that surveyed 912 players who played MMORPGs across 41 countries. The study showed that social interactions in MMORPGs are a major component in the enjoyment of playing video games. The study also showed MMORPGs can be extremely social games, with a vast number of gamers who play MMORPGs making lifelong friends or even partners. The study concluded that video gaming may allow players to express themselves in ways they that they might not be comfortable doing in real life because of their appearance, gender, sexuality, or age. This study is one of many that Griffiths has conducted on the topic of how video games affect people.\n", "Notable game designers who worked for Metagaming include Jackson, Lynn Willis and Keith Gross. Ben Ostrander, who was later the publisher of Mojo Press, served as the art director for most of the company's titles.\n"], "__answers__": ["Massively multiplayer online role playing game",
