The American roadrunner, specifically the greater roadrunner (Geococcyx californianus), is a bird known for its distinctive appearance and behavior. \n\n1. **Taxonomic Classification**: The American roadrunner is part of the order Cuculiformes, which includes cuckoos and their relatives. Within this order, it belongs to the family Cuculidae. This classification is confirmed by the retrieved knowledge stating that the greater roadrunner is identified as belonging to the cuckoo family, Cuculidae.\n\n2. **Genus Information**: The American roadrunner is classified under the genus \"Geococcyx.\" This is supported by the passage that states, \"Roadrunners are birds of the genus 'Geococcyx'.\"\n\n3. **Common Names**: The greater roadrunner is also known by several common names, including \"chaparral cock,\" \"ground cuckoo,\" and \"snake killer.\" This additional context enhances understanding of the bird's identity and cultural significance.\n\n4. **Confirmation of Existing Knowledge**: If the model's previous knowledge did not classify the American roadrunner correctly within the family Cuculidae, this information should be updated to ensure accuracy. The model should also recognize that the genus is \"Geococcyx.\"\n\nBy integrating this information, the model can enhance its accuracy regarding the classification of the American roadrunner, thereby preventing factual errors and alleviating potential model illusions related to its knowledge base.\n\n### Answer:\nThe American roadrunner belongs to the family Cuculidae."}], "question_info": {"question": "The American roadrunner belongs to which family of birds?", "passages": ["Roadrunners are birds of the genus \"Geococcyx\".\n", "The treerunners are several species of bird in the ovenbird family Furnariidae:\n", "The greater roadrunner (\"Geococcyx californianus\") is a long-legged bird in the cuckoo family, Cuculidae, from Southwestern United States and Mexico.
