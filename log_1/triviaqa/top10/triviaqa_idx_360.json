It made its first flight in 1949 and entered service with British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) in 1952. This establishes the Comet as a pioneering aircraft in the realm of commercial aviation.\n\n2. **First Scheduled Jet Service**: The Comet operated the first commercial jet service from London to Johannesburg in 1952. This fact is crucial because it confirms that the Comet was not only the first jet airliner but also the first to provide scheduled services, reinforcing its significance in the UK aviation landscape.\n\n3. **Innovative Features and Challenges**: The Comet was notable for its advanced design, which allowed it to fly faster and higher than propeller-driven aircraft. However, it faced serious challenges, including structural failures that led to crashes and its eventual withdrawal from service in 1954. This duality of innovation and risk is essential for understanding the complexities of introducing new technology.\n\n4. **Comparative Analysis**: While the Soviet Tupolev Tu-104 was the first jet airliner to provide sustained regular jet services starting in 1956, it is important to note that the Comet was the first jet airliner to enter service in the UK.
