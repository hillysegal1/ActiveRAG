The TR7 was manufactured by the Specialist Division of British Leyland from 1974 to 1981, while the Jaguar XJS was produced by Jaguar from 1975 to 1996.

This indicates that British Leyland was the parent company responsible for the production of the TR7.\n3. The Jaguar XJ-S (later called XJS) was also launched in 1975 and was manufactured and marketed by Jaguar, which was under the British Leyland umbrella during the 1970s.\n4. Both the Triumph TR7 and Jaguar XJS were produced under the same parent company, British Leyland, which was a significant automotive manufacturer in the UK during that era.\n5. The production timeline for the TR7 spans from September 1974 to October 1981, while the XJS was produced from 1975 to 1996. This reinforces the fact that both vehicles were produced during the 1970s under British Leyland's ownership.\n\n### Summary of Key Updates:\n- **Manufacturer**: Both the Triumph TR7 and Jaguar XJS were produced by British Leyland during the 1970s, with Triumph being part of the \"Jaguar-Rover-Triumph\" division.\n- **Production Timeline**: The TR7 was produced from 1974 to 1981, and the XJS was produced from 1975 to 1996.\n\n### Implications for Model Knowledge:\n- The model should be updated to reflect that British Leyland was the manufacturer of both the Triumph TR7 and the Jaguar XJS during the 1970s, correcting any potential misconceptions about the individual brands' independence during that period.\n- This enhanced understanding of the corporate relationships and historical context will help alleviate model illusions and ensure more accurate responses regarding the manufacturers of these vehicles.\n\n### Answer:\nBritish Leyland."}], "question_info": {"question": "During the 1970s which car maker produced the Triumph TR7 and the Jaguar XJS?", "passages": ["The Triumph TR7 is a sports car which was manufactured from September 1974 to October 1981 by the Specialist Division (latterly the \"Jaguar-Rover-Triumph\" division) of British Leyland in the United Kingdom. It was initially produced at the Speke, Liverpool factory, moving to Canley, Coventry in 1978 and then finally to the Rover Solihull plant in 1980. The car was launched in the United States in January 1975, with its UK home market debut in May 1976. The UK launch was delayed at least twice because of high demand for the vehicle in the US, with final sales of new TR7s continuing into 1982.\n", "TWR Jaguar cars won the WSCC outright in 1987, 1988 and 1991 and won the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans and the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1988 and 1990. The series started in 1985 with XJR-6 (Group 44 used XJR-5 and XJR-7), designed by Tony Southgate, with a chassis built from carbon-fibre and power provided by a highly tuned Jaguar V12 engine. This was followed by XJR-8, which won the WSCC Team's Championship in 1987, then XJR-9 which won the WSCC Team's Championship in 1988 and also secured victory at Le Mans the same year, returning in much the same form as the XJR-12 to win Le Mans again in 1990. TWR developed its own engine for the next series of cars, the XJR-10 (for IMSA) and XJR-11 (for WSCC) of 1989 and 1990, a V6 turbo-charged 3.5 litre, which was capable of far more power than the V12 but was less suited to 24 hour racing (hence the XJR-12 being deployed at Le Mans and the 24 hours of Daytona).\n", "The Jaguar XJ-S (later called XJS) is a luxury grand tourer manufactured and marketed by British automobile manufacturer Jaguar from 1975 to 1996, in coup\u00e9, fixed-profile and full convertible body styles. There were three distinct iterations, with a final production total of 115,413 units over 20 years and seven months.\n", "In November 1944 what was left of the Triumph Motor Company and the Triumph trade name were bought by the Standard Motor Company and a subsidiary \"Triumph Motor Company (1945) Limited\" was formed with production transferred to Standard's factory at Canley, on the outskirts of Coventry. Triumph's new owners had been supplying engines to Jaguar and its predecessor company since 1938. After an argument between Standard-Triumph Managing Director, Sir John Black, and William Lyons, the creator and owner of Jaguar, Black's objective in acquiring the rights to the name and the remnants of the bankrupt Triumph business was to build a car to compete with the soon to be launched post-war Jaguars.\n", "The Triumph TR7 Sprint version of the Triumph TR7 sports car was produced by the Triumph Motor Company (part of British Leyland) in 1977 in very limited numbers: probably no more than 61 in total. It used the 127\u00a0bhp, 16-valve, 2-litre version of the Triumph slant-four engine from the Triumph Dolomite Sprint, a highly tuned version of which, \"rated at 225\u00a0bhp at 8000\u00a0rpm\" by 1977, was used in the Group 4 TR7 cars of the BL works rally team, from 1976 until 1978. This was instead of the TR7 base model's 105\u00a0bhp, 8-valve, 2-litre version of the same basic slant-4 engine. The 16-valve version was originally specified in the Dolomite Sprint at 135\u00a0bhp, and carefully assembled, standard engines had been known to give a sustained 150\u00a0bhp on the factory test bed.\n", "The Triumph TR6 (1968\u201376) is a sports car built by British Triumph Motor Company between 1968 and 1976. It was the best-seller of the TR range when production ended, a record subsequently surpassed by the TR7. Of the 91,850 TR6s produced, 83,480 were exported; only 8,370 were sold in the UK.\n", "Because of proposed US legislation on roll-over protection at the time of its launch, the TR7 was not initially available as a convertible. In early 1979, Triumph belatedly introduced a convertible version, called the TR7 Drophead Coup\u00e9 (DHC), which first went on sale in the US (the original hardtop model being known as the Fixedhead Coup\u00e9, or FHC). A small number of pre-production cars were manufactured at Speke in 1978, soon after the pre-production TR7 V8 (later designated TR8) and TR7 Sprint cars. The British market received it in early 1980. The prototype for the convertible version of the original Harris Mann design came from Michelotti and the engineering to make it work was done by Triumph.\n", "In 1982, a successful relationship with Tom Walkinshaw's TWR team commenced with the XJ-S competing in the European Touring Car Championship, which it won in 1984. In 1985, the TWR XJ-S won the Bathurst 1000 race. In the mid-1980s TWR started designing and preparing Jaguar V12-engined Group C cars for World Sports Prototype Championship races. The team started winning regularly from 1987, and won Le Mans in 1988 and 1990 with the XJR series sports cars. The Jaguar XJR-14 was the last of the XJRs to win, taking the 1991 World Sportscar Championship.\n", "TWR created 'TWR Sport' in 1984 to produce heavily modified versions of the Jaguar XJ-S. Designated XJR-S, the cars benefited from the racing experience in European Touring Cars, featuring improved aerodynamics; uprated suspension and brakes; tuned engine and detail changes. The success of TWR Sport led to the formalising of a joint venture (50/50) in 1988 called 'Jaguar Sport'. Jaguar Sport would initially focus on building tuned versions of Jaguar road cars (the XJR-S coupe and XJR saloon). However, with overwhelming demand to put the concept Jaguar XJ220 into production, it was decided that Jaguar Sport would design and develop the new supercar, for which a new facility was secured at Bloxham, Oxfordshire. Production commenced in 1990 with the final cars delivered in 1993.\n", "The Triumph TR4 is a sports car produced by the Triumph Motor Company from 1961 to 1965. Code named \"Zest\" during development, it was the successor to the TR3A. The car was based on the chassis and drivetrain of the previous TR sports cars, but with a modern body designed by Michelotti. As 40,253 cars were built during its production years it proved to be very successful.\n"], "__answers__": ["British Leyland", "british leyland motor corporation limited", "British Leyland Motor Corporation", "British Leyland Motor Corporation Limited", "british leyland motor corp", "BLMC", "British Leyland Motor Corp", "british leyland motor corporation", "Leyland of Australia", "leykor", "Bleycar", "british leyland", "leyland of australia", "bleycar", "blmc", "Leykor", "The British Leyland Motor Corporation"]}}
