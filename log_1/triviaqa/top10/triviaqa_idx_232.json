The key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Moctezuma II**: Moctezuma II was the emperor of the Aztec Empire at the time of Cort\u00e9s's arrival. He was known for his initial diplomatic approach towards the Spanish, believing they might be divine figures. However, this led to his capture by Cort\u00e9s on November 14, 1519. His capture was a pivotal moment that significantly altered the power dynamics within the Aztec Empire.\n\n2. **Deposition by the Ruling Council**: While Moctezuma was held captive, tensions escalated between the Aztecs and the Spanish, particularly due to the actions of Cort\u00e9s's second-in-command, Pedro de Alvarado, who ordered a massacre of Aztec nobles. This violence prompted the Aztec ruling council to depose Moctezuma, leading to the election of his brother, **Cuitlahuac**, as the new emperor.\n\n3. **Cuitlahuac's Brief Reign**: Cuitlahuac took over after Moctezuma's deposition and attempted to lead a resistance against the Spanish. His reign was short-lived, lasting only about 40 to 80 days, as he died of smallpox in December 1520. Following his death, **Cuauht\u00e9moc** became the last emperor of the Aztec Empire.\n\n4. **Moctezuma's Death**: The circumstances surrounding Moctezuma's death are ambiguous. It is debated whether he died from injuries inflicted by his own people during a confrontation or if he was killed by the Spanish after they deemed him no longer useful. This ambiguity adds complexity to the narrative of his deposition.\n\n5. **Role of Pedro de Alvarado**: Alvarado's actions were instrumental in escalating the conflict between the Spanish and the Aztecs. His preemptive attack on Aztec nobles during a religious festival not only led to significant casualties but also fueled the Aztecs' desire to depose Moctezuma.\n\n6. **Hueyi Tlatoani**: Understanding the term \"Hueyi Tlatoani,\" which refers to the supreme ruler of the Aztec Empire, is crucial for grasping the political structure and significance of both Moctezuma and Cuitlahuac's roles during this tumultuous period.\n\n### Enhanced Summary:\nThe deposition of Moctezuma II by Cort\u00e9s was not a straightforward act of removal but rather a consequence of a series of events that included his capture, the violent actions of the Spanish, and the subsequent decision by the Aztec ruling council to elect Cuitlahuac as his successor.

The ambiguity surrounding the cause of his death\u2014whether it was due to his injuries or the actions of the Spanish\u2014adds complexity to the narrative of his deposition.\n\n4. **Cuitlahuac's Succession**: The passages also mention Cuitlahuac, who succeeded Moctezuma after his deposition. Cuitlahuac's brief reign (40 to 80 days) and his efforts to resist the Spanish highlight the ongoing struggle for power and control within the Aztec Empire during this tumultuous period.\n\n5. **Context of the Conquest**: The broader context of the Spanish conquest is essential for understanding the significance of Moctezuma's deposition. Cort\u00e9s's actions were part of a larger strategy to undermine and dismantle the Aztec Empire, which ultimately led to its fall and incorporation into the Spanish Empire.\n\n### Summary and Integration\n\nIn summary, the Aztec ruler who was deposed by Cort\u00e9s was **Moctezuma II**. His capture marked a pivotal moment in the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. While Cort\u00e9s played a crucial role in this deposition, it was also influenced by the internal political dynamics of the Aztec leadership, as evidenced by the council's decision to elect Cuitlahuac as the new emperor. Moctezuma's death shortly after his deposition further complicated the narrative, as it raised questions about the nature of his demise and the extent of Spanish responsibility.

His role as the ninth ruler is significant, as he was in power during the initial encounters with the Spanish.\n\n2. **Cort\u00e9s's Actions**: The passages indicate that on November 14, 1519, Cort\u00e9s captured Moctezuma II. This act was pivotal, as it not only demonstrated Cort\u00e9s's military might but also marked a direct challenge to the authority of the Aztec Empire. The capture led to significant unrest among the Aztec people, who viewed Moctezuma's subjugation as a betrayal.\n\n3. **Internal Political Dynamics**: While Cort\u00e9s played a crucial role in Moctezuma's deposition, the third passage highlights that the ruling council of Tenochtitlan ultimately voted to depose him and elected his brother, Cuitlahuac, as the new emperor. This indicates that Moctezuma's removal was not solely due to Spanish intervention but also involved internal Aztec political decisions, reflecting the complexities of leadership and governance within the empire.\n\n4. **Circumstances of Moctezuma's Death**: The passages also discuss the circumstances surrounding Moctezuma's death, which occurred after he was struck by a stone during a confrontation with his own people. The ambiguity regarding the cause of his death\u2014whether it was due to his injuries or the actions of the Spanish\u2014adds further complexity to the narrative of his deposition and highlights the chaotic environment during this period.\n\n5. **Cuitlahuac's Succession and Resistance**: Following Moctezuma's deposition, Cuitlahuac's brief reign is mentioned, emphasizing the ongoing struggle for power within the Aztec Empire. His efforts to resist the Spanish illustrate the resilience of the Aztec leadership, even in the face of overwhelming odds.\n\n6. **Broader Context of the Conquest**: Understanding the broader context of the Spanish conquest is crucial. Cort\u00e9s's actions were part of a systematic strategy to undermine the Aztec Empire, which ultimately led to its downfall and incorporation into the Spanish Empire. This context is vital for grasping the significance of Moctezuma's deposition and the subsequent events that unfolded.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe Aztec ruler who was deposed by Cort\u00e9s was **Moctezuma II**. His capture marked a critical turning point in the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, influenced by both Cort\u00e9s's military actions and the internal political dynamics of the Aztec leadership. Moctezuma's death shortly after his deposition further complicates the narrative, raising questions about the nature of his demise and the extent of Spanish responsibility in the events that transpired.

Moctezuma was initially welcoming to the Spanish, believing Cort\u00e9s might be a returning god.\n\n2. **Cort\u00e9s' Actions**:\n   - On November 14, 1519, Cort\u00e9s captured Moctezuma II, which was a pivotal moment that disrupted the existing power structure. Cort\u00e9s ordered the destruction of Aztec religious relics, which further alienated the Aztec people and escalated tensions.\n\n3. **Escalation of Conflict**:\n   - While Cort\u00e9s was away from Tenochtitlan, his lieutenant Pedro de Alvarado initiated a massacre of Aztec nobles during a religious festival. This act of violence incited outrage among the Aztecs, leading to a significant backlash against the Spanish forces.\n\n4. **Political Dynamics**:\n   - The ruling council of Tenochtitlan, witnessing the chaos and Moctezuma's inability to control the situation, voted to depose him.

At that time, the ruler of the Aztec Empire was Moctezuma II, the ninth emperor. Cort\u00e9s and his forces captured Moctezuma, which significantly impacted the power dynamics within the Aztec Empire.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to clarify that Moctezuma II was not directly deposed by Cort\u00e9s himself. According to the retrieved passages, while Cort\u00e9s was away, the ruling council of Tenochtitlan decided to depose Moctezuma and elected his brother, Cuitlahuac, as the new emperor. This indicates that the decision to remove Moctezuma was made internally by the Aztecs in response to the Spanish invasion and the deteriorating situation, rather than being a direct action taken by Cort\u00e9s.\n\nAdditionally, the circumstances surrounding Moctezuma's death are ambiguous. He was struck by a sling stone during a confrontation with his own people, and it is unclear whether he died from his injuries or was killed by the Spanish.

He ordered a Catholic cross placed on the Templo Mayor. While Cortes left for Veracruz to confront Spaniards looking to arrest him, Pedro de Alvarado learned of a plan to attack the Spaniards, and staged a pre-emptive attack on the Aztecs in the Sacred Precinct while they celebrated a religious festival. Unarmed and trapped within the walls of the Sacred Precinct, an estimated 8,000\u201310,000 Aztec nobles were killed. When word of the massacre spread throughout the city, the people turned on the Spaniards, killing seven, wounding many, and driving the rest back to their quarters. The Spaniards were trapped between two Aztec forces and 68 were captured alive. Ten of these Spanish captives were immediately sacrificed at the Temple and their severed heads were thrown back to the Spaniards. The others were sacrificed at the Great Temple that night, which could be seen from the Spanish camps. The sacrificed Spaniards were flayed and their faces \u2014 with beards attached \u2014 were tanned and sent to allied towns, both to solicit assistance and to warn against betraying the alliance.\n", "Believing that Cort\u00e9s had perished (or at least claiming to believe it), Salazar and Alm\u00edndez then ousted Zuazo on May 23, 1525, and began a tyrannical and criminal government.

He then took Motecuzoma up to the roof of the palace to ask his subjects to stand down.

After Cort\u00e9s returned, he liberated Cuitl\u00e1huac in exchange for supplies, allowing the lord to organize an army against the Spanish. Cuitlahuac succeeded Moctezuma as Aztec emperor and forced the Spanish to flee during the Noche Triste. However, Cuitlahuac was ruler only somewhere between 40 and 80 days according to various records. He spent that time repairing the city of Tenochtitlan as the Spanish regrouped in Tlaxcala.

Communications and entrances to the city were cut off. The Spanish outside the city had no food supplies and a severe shortage of drinking water. Cort\u00e9s had Moctezuma try to pacify his people by speaking to them from the palace, but the emperor was greeted with a storm of stones and arrows, wounding him badly. Moctezuma died a short time later, but whether he died from his injuries or whether the Spanish killed him, seeing that he was no longer of use to them, is unknown.
