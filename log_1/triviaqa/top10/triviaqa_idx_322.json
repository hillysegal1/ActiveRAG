Much of the current work in cosmology includes understanding how galaxies form in the context of the Big Bang, understanding the physics of the universe at earlier and earlier times, and reconciling observations with the basic theory.\\n', 'Fred Hoyle was an astronomer best known for his work on the understanding of the creation of the elements through stellar nucleosynthesis, for developing the steady state theory of the universe and for coining the term \"Big Bang\" for the steady state theory\\'s rival dynamic evolving model of the universe. Hoyle also had a taste for science fiction, having written a novel, \"The Black Cloud\" (1957), about a cloud of interstellar gas that threatens the Earth; this was adapted for radio and broadcast on 14 December 1957 by the BBC Home Service. The BBC were also interested in adapting \"The Black Cloud\" for television but Hoyle had already signed away the movie rights. Hoyle followed \"The Black Cloud\" with another science fiction novel, \"Ossian\\'s Ride\" (1958); this attracted the interest of Norman James, a BBC designer keen to move into television production, who contacted Hoyle with a view to obtaining the rights to the novel. In discussion with the writer, James learned that Hoyle was interested in writing an original story for television. James contacted John Elliot, the assistant head of the BBC Script Department, who was interested in making a science fiction serial. Elliot, along with James and BBC script editor Donald Bull, met with Hoyle who outlined a potential story for an eight-part serial; this was what would eventually become \"A for Andromeda\". Hoyle drew his inspiration for the serial from the work of astronomer Frank Drake who at that time had begun \"Project Ozma\", one of the first experiments in the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI). In late June 1960, the BBC made an offer of 250 guineas to Hoyle for the idea, which would be dramatised for television, as a serial in seven 30-minute parts, by John Elliot.

Initially, there was a split in support between these theories, but observational evidence, particularly the discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation in 1964, ultimately favored the Big Bang model.\n\n4. **Hoyle's Stance**:\n   - Despite the growing evidence supporting the Big Bang theory, Hoyle maintained his belief in the steady-state theory for many years. His rejection of the Big Bang theory and advocacy for steady-state cosmology illustrate the contentious nature of cosmological theories and the scientific process of hypothesis testing against empirical evidence.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, Sir Fred Hoyle's theory, which posits the continuous creation of matter as galaxies expand, is called **steady-state cosmology**. This theory stands in opposition to the Big Bang theory, which describes a universe that originated from a singular event. Hoyle's contributions to cosmology and his steadfast support for the steady-state model, despite contrary evidence, highlight the dynamic and often contentious nature of scientific discourse in understanding the universe's origins.\n\nTask Description:\n\nReview the reasoning process by evaluating how well the contextual relationships have been identified and utilized.

He is best known for his opposition to the Big Bang theory, which he famously coined during a BBC broadcast. Hoyle's alternative model, known as **steady-state cosmology**, proposed that the universe is eternal and unchanging in its large-scale structure, despite the observable expansion of galaxies.\n\nIn the steady-state model, as galaxies move apart, new matter is continuously created to fill the gaps, ensuring that the overall density of the universe remains constant over time. This concept directly addresses the question's focus on the continuous creation of matter between galaxies, which is a hallmark of Hoyle's theory.\n\nHistorically, the development of these theories occurred in the post-World War II era, when significant advancements in observational astronomy began to challenge existing cosmological models. Hoyle's steady-state theory was one of the main alternatives to the Big Bang theory, which was supported by scientists like Georges Lema\u00eetre and George Gamow. Over time, observational evidence, particularly the discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation in 1964, increasingly favored the Big Bang model, leading to a decline in support for the steady-state theory.\n\nDespite the mounting evidence against it, Hoyle remained a staunch advocate for steady-state cosmology, illustrating the contentious nature of scientific discourse and the challenges of paradigm shifts in scientific understanding.\n\n### Final Answer\n**Steady State Theory** (or **Steady-State Cosmology**)"}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nWhat was the name of Sir Fred Hoyles theory, an alternative to the Big Bang, that said that there was continuous creation of matter between galaxies, so that as galaxies get further apart, new ones develop between them?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['Astronomer Fred Hoyle discovered the process by which the heavier elements essential to life are created by nuclear reactions in the cores of massive stars. He then proposed a theory of the history of the universe known as steady-state cosmology, which has the universe existing forever without an initial Big Bang (as Hoyle derisively dubbed it). He held his belief in the steady state long after observations proved that the Big Bang had happened.\\n', 'After World War II, two distinct possibilities emerged. One was Fred Hoyle\\'s steady state model, whereby new matter would be created as the universe seemed to expand. In this model the universe is roughly the same at any point in time. The other was Lema\u00eetre\\'s Big Bang theory, advocated and developed by George Gamow, who introduced Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and whose associates, Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman, predicted the CMB. Ironically, it was Hoyle who coined the phrase that came to be applied to Lema\u00eetre\\'s theory, referring to it as \"this \"big bang\" idea\" during a BBC Radio broadcast in March 1949. For a while, support was split between these two theories. Eventually, the observational evidence, most notably from radio source counts, began to favor Big Bang over Steady State. The discovery and confirmation of the CMB in 1964 secured the Big Bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the universe. Much of the current work in cosmology includes understanding how galaxies form in the context of the Big Bang, understanding the physics of the universe at earlier and earlier times, and reconciling observations with the basic theory.\\n', 'Fred Hoyle was an astronomer best known for his work on the understanding of the creation of the elements through stellar nucleosynthesis, for developing the steady state theory of the universe and for coining the term \"Big Bang\" for the steady state theory\\'s rival dynamic evolving model of the universe. Hoyle also had a taste for science fiction, having written a novel, \"The Black Cloud\" (1957), about a cloud of interstellar gas that threatens the Earth; this was adapted for radio and broadcast on 14 December 1957 by the BBC Home Service. The BBC were also interested in adapting \"The Black Cloud\" for television but Hoyle had already signed away the movie rights. Hoyle followed \"The Black Cloud\" with another science fiction novel, \"Ossian\\'s Ride\" (1958); this attracted the interest of Norman James, a BBC designer keen to move into television production, who contacted Hoyle with a view to obtaining the rights to the novel. In discussion with the writer, James learned that Hoyle was interested in writing an original story for television. James contacted John Elliot, the assistant head of the BBC Script Department, who was interested in making a science fiction serial. Elliot, along with James and BBC script editor Donald Bull, met with Hoyle who outlined a potential story for an eight-part serial; this was what would eventually become \"A for Andromeda\". Hoyle drew his inspiration for the serial from the work of astronomer Frank Drake who at that time had begun \"Project Ozma\", one of the first experiments in the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI). In late June 1960, the BBC made an offer of 250 guineas to Hoyle for the idea, which would be dramatised for television, as a serial in seven 30-minute parts, by John Elliot. Hoyle replied, \"It has seemed to me that the overall sum of 250 gns is unsatisfactorily low. My own computations would suggest 1000 gns.

He then proposed a theory of the history of the universe known as steady-state cosmology, which has the universe existing forever without an initial Big Bang (as Hoyle derisively dubbed it). He held his belief in the steady state long after observations proved that the Big Bang had happened.\n", "After World War II, two distinct possibilities emerged. One was Fred Hoyle's steady state model, whereby new matter would be created as the universe seemed to expand. In this model the universe is roughly the same at any point in time. The other was Lema\u00eetre's Big Bang theory, advocated and developed by George Gamow, who introduced Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and whose associates, Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman, predicted the CMB. Ironically, it was Hoyle who coined the phrase that came to be applied to Lema\u00eetre's theory, referring to it as \"this \"big bang\" idea\" during a BBC Radio broadcast in March 1949. For a while, support was split between these two theories. Eventually, the observational evidence, most notably from radio source counts, began to favor Big Bang over Steady State. The discovery and confirmation of the CMB in 1964 secured the Big Bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the universe. Much of the current work in cosmology includes understanding how galaxies form in the context of the Big Bang, understanding the physics of the universe at earlier and earlier times, and reconciling observations with the basic theory.\n", "Fred Hoyle was an astronomer best known for his work on the understanding of the creation of the elements through stellar nucleosynthesis, for developing the steady state theory of the universe and for coining the term \"Big Bang\" for the steady state theory's rival dynamic evolving model of the universe. Hoyle also had a taste for science fiction, having written a novel, \"The Black Cloud\" (1957), about a cloud of interstellar gas that threatens the Earth; this was adapted for radio and broadcast on 14 December 1957 by the BBC Home Service. The BBC were also interested in adapting \"The Black Cloud\" for television but Hoyle had already signed away the movie rights. Hoyle followed \"The Black Cloud\" with another science fiction novel, \"Ossian's Ride\" (1958); this attracted the interest of Norman James, a BBC designer keen to move into television production, who contacted Hoyle with a view to obtaining the rights to the novel. In discussion with the writer, James learned that Hoyle was interested in writing an original story for television. James contacted John Elliot, the assistant head of the BBC Script Department, who was interested in making a science fiction serial. Elliot, along with James and BBC script editor Donald Bull, met with Hoyle who outlined a potential story for an eight-part serial; this was what would eventually become \"A for Andromeda\". Hoyle drew his inspiration for the serial from the work of astronomer Frank Drake who at that time had begun \"Project Ozma\", one of the first experiments in the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI). In late June 1960, the BBC made an offer of 250 guineas to Hoyle for the idea, which would be dramatised for television, as a serial in seven 30-minute parts, by John Elliot. Hoyle replied, \"It has seemed to me that the overall sum of 250 gns is unsatisfactorily low. My own computations would suggest 1000 gns. I estimate that such a sum would still be only 2\u20133 percent of the receipts by the BBC from licences. Such a percentage still seems low \u2013 it is considerably less than rates available in the US\".Mitton, \"Conflict in the Cosmos\", p.\u00a0254. Eventually, a fee of 700 guineas was agreed. Elliot delivered his draft scripts between March and April 1961; at this point it was decided that each episode should run for 45 minutes and so Elliot had to work to expand each script.\n", "In 1958, Hoyle was Plumian professor of astronomy at Cambridge and engaged in the study of the structure and evolution of the stars. Even though he coined the phrase \u201cBig Bang,\u201d Hoyle rejected the \u2018big bang\u2019 theory of the origin of the universe in favor of the steady state theory, which claimed that the universe has always looked as it does now. Martin Ryle, however, held to the big bang theory for the creation of the universe in a moment, the theory that eventually held sway. Some of Hoyle's writings, including science fiction and plays, popularized astronomy. Christopher H. Derrick of Geoffrey Bles publishers, presumably in 1963 and before Lewis's death, wrote a proposal for a book that was to include \u201cReligion and Rocketry,\u201d stating that \u201cThis essay seems to have been written in rebuttal of an argument which is only likely to be brought forward by a rather silly minority (though an academically distinguished one)\u2026\u201d Hoyle would have been part of that academically distinguished, but silly, minority.\n", "Sir Fred Hoyle FRS (24 June 1915\u00a0\u2013 20 August 2001) was an English astronomer who formulated the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis.

Menzel Professor Emeritus of Astronomy at Harvard University. He is known for his cosmological theory of the expansion of the universe, which postulates that its order and information are increasing despite the second law of thermodynamics. He is also known for being one of the most notable researchers who advocated for a Cold Big Bang theory. When he proposed this theory in 1966, he suggested it would solve Olbers' paradox, which holds that the night sky on Earth should be much brighter than it actually is. He also published several articles critiquing hereditarian views on human intelligence, such as those of Richard Herrnstein and Arthur Jensen. He has been a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1963, and is also a member of Divisions B and J of the International Astronomical Union.\n", "Inspired by the Machian nature of the Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory for electrodynamics, Fred Hoyle and Jayant Narlikar proposed their own theory of gravity in the context of general relativity. This model still exists in spite of recent astronomical observations that have challenged the theory. Stephen Hawking had criticized the original Hoyle-Narlikar theory believing that the advanced waves going off to infinity would lead to a divergence, as indeed they would, if the universe were only expanding. However, as emphasized in the revised version of the Hoyle-Narlikar theory devoid of the \"Creation Field\" (generating matter out of empty space) known as the Gravitational absorber theory, the universe is also accelerating in that expansion. The acceleration leads to a horizon type cutoff and hence no divergence. Gravitational absorber theory has been used to explain the mass fluctuations in the Woodward effect (see section on Woodward effect below).\n", "In 2003, Peter Lynds has put forward a new cosmology model in which time is cyclic. In his theory our Universe will eventually stop expanding and then contract. Before becoming a singularity, as one would expect from Hawking's black hole theory, the universe would bounce. Lynds claims that a singularity would violate the second law of thermodynamics and this stops the universe from being bounded by singularities. The Big Crunch would be avoided with a new Big Bang. Lynds suggests the exact history of the universe would be repeated in each cycle in an eternal recurrence. Some critics argue that while the universe may be cyclic, the histories would all be variants. Lynds' theory has been dismissed by mainstream physicists for the lack of a mathematical model behind its philosophical considerations.\n"], "__answers__": ["Steady-state", "Steady State", "Steady State", "steady state concentration", "steady state condition", "Steady state concentration", "Steady State (Thermodynamics)", "Steady state", "steady state", "Steady-state condition", "steady state thermodynamics"]}}
