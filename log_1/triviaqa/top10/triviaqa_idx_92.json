To answer this, I need to consider the context of the ratification process of the US Constitution, which was drafted in 1787 and required the approval of nine states to become effective.\n\n1. **Historical Context**: Delaware ratified the Constitution on December 7, 1787, making it the first state to do so. This action was significant not only for Delaware but also for the entire nation, as it set a precedent for the other states to follow. The unanimous support from Delaware's delegates indicates a strong commitment to the new framework of government.\n\n2. **Subsequent Ratifications**: Following Delaware's ratification, Pennsylvania became the second state to ratify on December 12, 1787. This sequence of events illustrates how Delaware's early decision influenced the momentum for ratification among the other states.\n\n3. **Official Recognition**: The nickname \"The First State\" was officially adopted on May 23, 2002, to commemorate Delaware's role in the ratification process. This recognition reinforces Delaware's historical importance in American governance.\n\n4. **Causal Relationships**: The early ratification by Delaware played a crucial role in establishing the necessary momentum for the Constitution's acceptance. It demonstrates how initial actions can lead to broader outcomes, such as the eventual ratification by the required nine states.\n\n5. **Temporal Relationships**: Understanding the timeline of events is essential. Delaware's ratification was the first step in a series of actions that led to the Constitution being adopted, highlighting the importance of timing in historical events.\n\nBy synthesizing this information, I can conclude that Delaware's early ratification not only earned it the title \"The First State\" but also significantly impacted the course of American history by facilitating the establishment of the Constitution.\n\n### Answer:\nDelaware"}], "cognition": [{"role": "user", "content": " Fact-checking refers to the process of confirming the accuracy of a statement or claim through various sources or methods. \nThis process aims to ensure that statements or claims are based on reliable and verifiable information while eliminating inaccurate or misleading content. \nFact-checking may involve the examination of data, literature, expert opinions, or other trustworthy sources.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, model illusion refers to the overconfidence response of the AI. \nWhen a model exhibits an 'illusion' (a tendency to output deceptive data), it indicates that the training data used by the model does not necessarily support the rationality of its outputs.\nYou are a scientist researching fact-checking and addressing model illusions in artificial intelligence. \nTo answer the following question:\nWhich US state is known as The First State as it was first to ratify the Constitution in 1787?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['Delaware was the first state to ratify the United States Constitution.\\n', 'BULLET::::- First State to ratify the Constitution of the United States of America on December 7, 1787\\n', 'BULLET::::- The State of Delaware becomes the 1st state to ratify the US Constitution on December 7, 1787\\n', 'BULLET::::- 1st state to ratify the Constitution of the United States of America\\n', 'BULLET::::- 1787 \u2013 Delaware becomes the first state to ratify the United States Constitution.\\n', 'Delaware, on December 7, 1787, became the first State to ratify the new Constitution, with its vote being unanimous.
