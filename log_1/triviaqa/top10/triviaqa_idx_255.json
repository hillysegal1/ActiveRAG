The top row numbers go from 1-15, the middle row numbers go from 16-30 and the bottom row went from 31-45. And they are all across the contestants' podiums. The object of the game was to light up all 15 squares of their cards. They did that by answering a series of questions correctly. Get a question wrong, and the player is frozen out of the next question. Also unlike the two previous versions, the numbers lit up at random, not in numerical order or by verbal choice. And finally, when the home game was over by the sound of the hooter, the remaining numbers were blacked out and replaced with stars. The game was played for three rounds; the first two were worth \u00a3500 and the third was worth \u00a31,000 for a total of \u00a32,000.\n", "Two contestants compete on each episode. On each turn, a Bingo ball comes out of the hopper and a question is asked. Each ball has a number from 1 to 75 and a letter in the word \"BINGO\" printed on it. If the question is answered correctly, the player earns the letter from that ball and the number on the ball is added in dollars to the bank, which starts at $500 (e.g., if G-50 comes out, the bank increases by $50). If the letter is a duplicate already earned by the player, no extra letters are earned. The first player that spells out BINGO from the earned letters wins the game. A Free-Space Ball with a sponsor's logo acts as a wild card in the game. The player who answers a question correctly when that ball is rolled out can choose any letter, and $100 is added to the bank. Two regular games are played. Contestants who win both games win the match and receive all the money in the bank. If each contestant wins one game, a five-question tie-breaker game is played. The first question's answer begins with a B, the second question's answer starts with I, and so on. The first to answer three questions correctly wins the money in the bank and goes on to play the Bingo Bonus Board for a chance at $100,000.\n", "Ready/Waiting/Cased/Set/Down/Chance \u2013 A player who only needs one number in order to complete the Bingo pattern is considered to be Ready, Waiting, Cased, Set, or Down, or to \"have a chance\".\n", "Bingo's Run\n", "A typical Bingo game utilizes the numbers 1 through 75. The five columns of the card are labeled 'B', 'I', 'N', 'G', and 'O' from left to right. The center space is usually marked \"Free\" or \"Free Space\", and is considered automatically filled. The range of printed numbers that can appear on the card is normally restricted by column, with the 'B' column only containing numbers between 1 and 15 inclusive, the 'I' column containing only 16 through 30, 'N' containing 31 through 45, 'G' containing 46 through 60, and 'O' containing 61 through 75.\n", "The player's goal is to compete with a cat to navigate and claim squares on a Bingo card, with either numbers or letters pseudorandomly arranged in 1 to 25 or A to Z, respectively. This directly contradicts the number order of real Bingo where the numbers range from 1 to 75 (with each column getting fifteen numbers assigned to it). Also contrary to standard Bingo, the card is shared by both the cat and bird, and the squares are claimed by moving to the next square of numerical/alphabetical order and pressing the A button. Since the cat and bird cannot occupy the same square, the game is more about planning and strategy than flat out luck of ordinary Bingo. Claiming five numbers in a row, column, or main diagonal is a \"bingo\"; claiming the most numbers without making a bingo is also a win. In a single-player game, earning multiple simultaneous bingos will provide an extra chance for each extra line made.\n", "Four players were given separate Bingo-style cards and attempted to light up the numbers on them by answering questions. Cards had three rows of six spaces each, with one space per row already blanked out to leave 15 numbers showing; however, the numbers in the corners of each card were never blanked out. Numbers on the cards ran from 1 to 60. The winner of each round received their choice of three prizes that increased in value from one round to the next. On charity specials, each correct answer awarded \u00a310 to a charitable cause nominated by the player who gave it.\n", "As each number is called, players check to see if it appears on their tickets. If it does, they mark it off with a special marker called a \"dabber\" or \"dauber\", or simply cross it off with a pen or pencil, depending on the venue. When all the numbers required to win a prize have been marked off, the player shouts in order to attract the caller's attention. There are no formal rules as to what can be shouted, but most players will shout \"Yes\" or \"Bingo\". Some players may also choose to shout \"Line\" or \"House\" depending on the prize, whilst others choose to shout \"house\" for any win (including a line or two lines), players may use any other call to attract the caller's attention (should they wish). An official or member of staff will then come and check the claim:\n", "A player has 20 turns to \"spin\" the numbers below his or her bingo card. Five numbers appear, and if they are found on the card, they can be marked off.\n", "Typically 43 to 48 numbers are pre-drawn at the beginning of a bingo session. The numbers pre-drawn can be odd, even or the first 43 numbers that pop out the machine. Players purchase cards and mark out all even, odd or pre-drawn numbers. At a designated time, the caller asks if anyone has bingo. If no one does, the caller then draws one ball at a time until someone shouts bingo. This game is sometimes played as a \"progressive\" game, where the jackpot increases if no one hits bingo before the desired number of balls are called. If no one has achieved bingo before or on the desired ball count then the game is played again in another session in which the desired ball count increases by one and the jackpot is increased also. The player who hits bingo after the desired ball count does not win the jackpot but does win a consolation prize. If a player does hit bingo in the right number of numbers then they win all the money in the jackpot. The ball count goes back to 43 after the jackpot is won and the ball count increases by one until the jackpot is won again.\n"], "__answers__": ["31", "thirty one", "thirty-one"]}}
