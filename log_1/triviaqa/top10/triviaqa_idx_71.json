Specifically, she won gold in the all-around, balance beam, and uneven bars, while earning silver in the team event and bronze in the floor exercise. This aligns perfectly with the details requested in the question.\n\n3. **Historical Significance**: Com\u0103neci's achievements during the 1976 Olympics were groundbreaking. The context surrounding her performance is crucial; she not only set a new standard for gymnastics but also became an iconic figure in sports history. The passage notes, \"Almost a quarter of all the medals... were won in gymnastics, with Olympic and sport icon Nadia Com\u0103neci becoming the first gymnast ever to score a perfect ten in an Olympic event.\" This highlights the broader impact of her performance on the sport and the Olympics as a whole.\n\n4. **Comparison with Other Athletes**: While the passages mention other notable gymnasts, such as Shannon Miller and V\u011bra \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1, they serve to contextualize Com\u0103neci's unique achievements rather than detract from them. The focus remains on her unparalleled success at the 1976 Olympics, reinforcing her status as a singularly significant figure in gymnastics.\n\nIn conclusion, the contextual relationships and nuances surrounding Nadia Com\u0103neci's performance in 1976 have been thoroughly identified and integrated into the reasoning process. Her scoring of 7 perfect 10s, coupled with her medal achievements, not only answers the question but also emphasizes her lasting legacy in the sport of gymnastics.\n\n**Answer:**\nNadia Com\u0103neci"}], "logician": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a logician, to answer the following question:\nIn 1976, which gymnast scored 7 maximum scores of 10 as she won three gold medals, one silver and one bronze?\nI will provide you with several retrieved passages:\nPassages:\n['While training for the World Championships in Tokyo, Sacramone tore her Achilles tendon.

The 1976 Summer Olympics were held in Montreal, Canada, where gymnastics was a highlight of the games.\n\n1. **Identifying the Gymnast**: The gymnast in question must have had an extraordinary performance, winning three gold medals, one silver, and one bronze. This level of success is indicative of a standout athlete in gymnastics.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: Nadia Com\u0103neci from Romania is the most notable gymnast from the 1976 Olympics. She is famously recognized for being the first gymnast to score a perfect 10.0 in Olympic history during these games. \n\n3. **Achievements**: According to the retrieved knowledge, Nadia Com\u0103neci scored a total of 7 perfect 10s during the 1976 Olympics.

She returned to the U.S. immediately for surgery. However, the team kept her name on the roster, and she was given a gold medal despite not competing. This gave her the most World Championships medals of any female American gymnast, with ten. Simone Biles would break that record in 2015.\n", "There were only 4 routines left for each gymnast to compete. With 2 down and 2 to go the places were now: Gnauck 1st, Davydova 2nd, Shaposhnikova and Comaneci joint 3rd. Nadia Com\u0103neci then scored a 10 on bars, the only gymnast to receive a perfect score that night. (It was her first perfect score on bars in a major competition since the 1976 Olympics). Neil Admur, New York Times, 25 July 1980, A17, \"The drama on the final rotation added to the suspense. Miss Gnauck was second among the 9 gymnasts on the vault, Miss Davydova seventh on the bars and Miss Comaneci eight on the beam\". Maxi Gnauck held the lead until her last routine when she vaulted insecurely. She scored 9.7, on a vault with a start value of 9.9, the same as she had scored for this vault at 1979 European Championships in Denmark and 79 World Championships in United States. Barry Lorge, Washington Post, 25 July 1980, p.\u00a09, \"Gnauck, first of the contenders up in the fourth and final rotation. Her first vault looked good but was too safe : 9.7.
