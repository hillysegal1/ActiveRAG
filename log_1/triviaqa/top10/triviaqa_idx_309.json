England was defeated at the Battle of Formigny in 1450 and finally at the Battle of Castillon in 1453, retaining only a single town in France, Calais.\n", "Up to this point, the succession crisis had been a purely internal affair. But to complicate things further, the Hundred Years' War between England and France had broken out four years earlier, in 1337. In 1341, there was truce between the two countries, but there was little doubt that hostilities would be renewed when the truce ended in June 1342. Thus, when rumours reached Philip VI of France that John of Montfort had received English agents, the French Crown naturally took a more direct interest in the situation. Charles of Blois became the official French candidate. Whatever had been his original intentions, John of Montfort was now forced to support Edward III of England as King of France.\n", "The Hundred Years' War in the 14th and 15th\u00a0centuries was fought between the kings of England and France over the succession to the French throne. The war ended in 1453 when the English were finally ejected from France, but in the early 15th\u00a0century the English under King Henry\u00a0V made significant territorial gains. The Treaty of Troyes in 1420 made Henry\u00a0V the heir apparent to the French throne but when the French king, Charles\u00a0VI, and Henry\u00a0V died in the space of two months in 1422 the issue of succession was again uncertain. The English supported Henry\u00a0V's son, Henry\u00a0VI who was still a child, while the French supported recognised Charles\u00a0VII, the Dauphin of France. Between 1427 and 1450 Ch\u00e2teau de Chinon was the residence of Charles, when Touraine was virtually the only territory left to him in France, the rest being occupied by the Burgundians or the English.\n", "From 1340 to 1360, and from 1369 on, the King of England assumed the title of \"King of France\"; but although England was generally successful in its war with France, no attempt was made to make the title a reality during that period of time.\n", "BULLET::::- 1431 \u2013 Hundred Years' War: Henry VI of England is crowned King of France at Notre Dame in Paris.\n", "Europe entered a period which saw almost continuous war for the next century. Fighting took place in the Duchy of Brittany, \"a country well suited to guerilla warfare\", from 1342\u20131365 in the Breton War of Succession. The Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131453) between France and England continued, and Edward III led an invasion resulting in a number of victories. One of the earlier English victories was at the naval Battle of Sluys in 1340, which annihilated the French fleet and gave the English control of the English Channel for several years. The initial campaigns were frustrating and expensive, so Edward altered his strategy to use English armies that were lightly supported but prepared to forage off the land. It successfully established English control over Brittany in 1342. Further armies were sent to Brittany and Gascony in 1345, and Edward himself crossed the Channel in 1346 with 10,000 men \u2014 an enormous army by contemporary standards. They plundered Caen, an important town in Normandy, and eventually began moving back toward the Channel.\n"], "__answers__": ["Edward III of England", "Edward III of England", "Edward III of England", "Edward III", "Edward III", "Edward III", "Edward III", "King Edward III of England", "King Edward III of England", "King Edward III", "Edward III (England)", "Edward 3", "Edward the Third", "King Edward III of Windsor", "edward of windsor", "eduard iii", "king edward iii", "edward iii england", "edward third", "Edward III Plantagenet", "Edward III, King of England", "King of England III", "Edward iii", "edward 3", "Eduard III", "king edward iii of windsor", "Edward of Windsor", "edward iii plantagenet of windsor", "edward iii plantagenet", "Edward III of Windsor", "Edward III, King of the English", "Edward iii of england", "EDWARD III", "king of england iii", "edward iii king of england", "king edward iii of england", "edward iii of windsor", "edward iii", "Edward III Plantagenet of Windsor", "edward iii king of english", "edward iii of england"]}}
