{"question": "The feathers of which bird are said to bring bad luck if they are brought into the house?", "vanilla_rag_result": "The passages provided do not specifically mention any bird whose feathers are said to bring bad luck if brought into the house. However, they do mention that owls are associated with bad luck, witchcraft, and death in parts of Africa. While this does not directly answer the question about feathers, it suggests that owls may be perceived negatively in certain cultures. If you are looking for a specific bird associated with bad luck in relation to feathers, that information is not explicitly provided in the text."}
