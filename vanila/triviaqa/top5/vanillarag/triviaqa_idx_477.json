{"question": "What trade did both Dick Turpin and Butch Cassidy follow?", "vanilla_rag_result": "Both Dick Turpin and Butch Cassidy were involved in criminal activities, specifically as outlaws. However, in terms of legitimate trades, Dick Turpin was a butcher, having followed in his father's footsteps. The passage does not provide specific information about Butch Cassidy's trade before becoming an outlaw, but it does mention that he was a train robber and bank robber. Therefore, while both were criminals, only Dick Turpin is explicitly noted to have been a butcher."}
