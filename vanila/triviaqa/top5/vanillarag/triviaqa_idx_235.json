{"question": "What the note is at the 12th fret of the 1st and 6th strings of a standard-tuned 6-string guitar?", "vanilla_rag_result": "In standard tuning, the 1st string (high E) is tuned to E, and the 6th string (low E) is tuned to E as well. \n\nWhen you play the 12th fret on the 1st string, you will be playing the note E an octave higher (which is also E). \n\nSimilarly, when you play the 12th fret on the 6th string, you will also be playing the note E (the same pitch as the open 1st string, but one octave lower).\n\nTherefore, the note at the 12th fret of both the 1st and 6th strings of a standard-tuned 6-string guitar is E."}
