{"question": "What film was the first sequel to win a Best Picture Oscar?", "vanilla_rag_result": "The passage does not explicitly name the film that was the first sequel to win a Best Picture Oscar. However, it mentions that the film in question is the second in a film series and could be viewed as the first \"sequel\" to ever be nominated for Best Picture. Unfortunately, without additional context or a specific title provided in the passages, I cannot identify the film."}
