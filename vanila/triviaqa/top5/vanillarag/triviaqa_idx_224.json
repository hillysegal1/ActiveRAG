{"question": "In what mountain range would you find the city of Tbilisi?", "vanilla_rag_result": "The city of Tbilisi is surrounded by several mountain ranges, primarily bounded to the north by the Saguramo Range and to the south and west by various endings (sub-ranges) of the Trialeti Range. Therefore, you would find Tbilisi in proximity to both the Saguramo Range and the Trialeti Range."}
