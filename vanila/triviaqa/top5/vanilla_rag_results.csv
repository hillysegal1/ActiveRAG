1,"To solve the question ""Five ninths of three fifths,"" we can break it down into a mathematical expression.

1. **Convert the fractions**:
   - Five ninths can be expressed as \( \frac{5}{9} \).
   - Three fifths can be expressed as \( \frac{3}{5} \).

2. **Multiply the fractions**:
   \[
   \frac{5}{9} \times \frac{3}{5} = \frac{5 \times 3}{9 \times 5} = \frac{15}{45}
   \]

3. **Simplify the fraction**:
   \[
   \frac{15}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
