1,"To solve the question ""Five ninths of three fifths,"" we need to interpret the terms mathematically.

1. **Five ninths** can be expressed as the fraction \( \frac{5}{9} \).
2. **Three fifths** can be expressed as the fraction \( \frac{3}{5} \).

Now, we multiply these two fractions:

\[
\frac{5}{9} \times \frac{3}{5} = \frac{5 \times 3}{9 \times 5} = \frac{15}{45}
\]

Next, we simplify \( \frac{15}{45} \):

\[
\frac{15}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Thus, five ninths of three fifths is \( \frac{1}{3} \).",False,[]
