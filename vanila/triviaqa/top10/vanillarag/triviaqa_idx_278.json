{"question": "Who were the notorious Friars of St Francis of Wycombe?", "vanilla_rag_result": "The notorious Friars of St Francis of Wycombe were members of a club founded by Sir Francis Dashwood in 1752, which was initially known by various names including the \"Brotherhood of St. Francis of Wy,\" \"Order of Knights of West Wycombe,\" and \"The Order of the Friars of St Francis of Wycombe.\" This group later became associated with the Hellfire Club, although it was not originally known by that name. The club held its first meeting on \"Walpurgis Night\" at Sir Francis's family home in West Wycombe and later moved its meetings to Medmenham Abbey. The club was known for its extravagant and hedonistic activities, which included the decoration of the Abbey with mythological themes and sexual symbols."}
