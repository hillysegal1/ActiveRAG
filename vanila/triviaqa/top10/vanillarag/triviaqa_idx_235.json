{"question": "What the note is at the 12th fret of the 1st and 6th strings of a standard-tuned 6-string guitar?", "vanilla_rag_result": "In standard tuning for a six-string guitar, the 1st string (high E) is tuned to E4, and the 6th string (low E) is tuned to E2. \n\nWhen you play the 12th fret on the 1st string, you raise the pitch by 12 semitones (or one octave), resulting in E5. \n\nSimilarly, when you play the 12th fret on the 6th string, you also raise the pitch by 12 semitones, resulting in E3.\n\nTherefore, the note at the 12th fret of the 1st string is E5, and the note at the 12th fret of the 6th string is E3."}
