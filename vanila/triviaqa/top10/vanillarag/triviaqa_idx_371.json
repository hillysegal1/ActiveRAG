{"question": "Where certain religions divide the notion of heaven into parts there are generally?", "vanilla_rag_result": "Certain religions generally divide the notion of heaven into parts by distinguishing multiple levels or divisions within heaven. For example, the concept of seven heavens is found in various religious traditions, including Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, as well as in some Indian religions like Hinduism. Additionally, in Jewish mysticism, particularly in Kabbalah, there are descriptions of seven compartments or habitations of heaven. This division reflects a belief in a structured cosmology where heaven is not a singular entity but consists of multiple layers or realms."}
