{"question": "Who was expelled from the Surrealist movement due to his views on the Spanish Civil War?", "vanilla_rag_result": "The passage does not explicitly mention anyone being expelled from the Surrealist movement specifically due to their views on the Spanish Civil War. However, it does mention that some figures from the Surrealist movement were expelled, and it notes that one individual, who campaigned against Aragon, moved away from communism during the 1930s. This individual is not named in the provided text, so it is unclear who exactly was expelled for their views on the Spanish Civil War. The passage primarily discusses various political and intellectual figures and their activities during that period without specifying the names of those expelled from Surrealism for their views on the war."}
