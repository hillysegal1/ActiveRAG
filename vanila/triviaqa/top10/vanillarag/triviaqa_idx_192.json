{"question": "What creature was used as the US Dodge automotive logo in the 1930s-50s, and again 1970s-2000s?", "vanilla_rag_result": "The creature used as the US Dodge automotive logo in the 1930s-50s, and again in the 1970s-2000s, was a knight's head. This emblem was part of the crest introduced in 1941, which featured the knight's head at the top. Although the head was dropped for 1955, the emblem itself survived through 1957 and reappeared on the 1976 Aspen, continuing to be used until it was replaced by the Pentastar in 1982."}
