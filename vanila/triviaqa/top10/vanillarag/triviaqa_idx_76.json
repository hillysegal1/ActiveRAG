{"question": "Who was the youngest person to become president of the USA?", "vanilla_rag_result": "The youngest person to become president of the USA was Theodore Roosevelt, who assumed office at the age of 42. However, based on the passages provided, it mentions that Al Gore would have been the youngest man to contest the presidency on a major party ticket at age 40, but it does not state that he became president. Therefore, the passages do not provide a definitive answer to who the youngest president of the USA is, as they contain conflicting information. The youngest president ever elected was John F. Kennedy at age 43."}
