{"question": "The Florentine Girdle was a type of what?", "vanilla_rag_result": "The Florentine Girdle was a type of girdle, which refers to a garment worn by women that created a rigid, controlled figure. Girdles were considered essential garments from around 1920 to the late 1960s and were associated with modesty and respectability. Additionally, the term \"girdle\" can also refer to the girdle books mentioned in the passages, which were a form of medieval book-binding. However, in the context of the question, it is most likely referring to the garment aspect."}
