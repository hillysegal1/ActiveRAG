{"question": "Name the Mexican/American boxer, who retired from the ring in 2008, who is the only man to win world titles in six different weight divisions?", "vanilla_rag_result": "The Mexican/American boxer you are referring to is \u00c9rik Morales. He retired from the ring in 2008 and is known for winning world titles in four different weight classes, but the passage does not specify a boxer who won titles in six different weight divisions. However, it does mention that Morales was the first Mexican-born boxer to win world titles in four different weight classes. If you are looking for a boxer who won titles in six different weight divisions, that information is not provided in the passages."}
