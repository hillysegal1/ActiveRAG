{"question": "where does the president get authority to issue executive orders", "vanilla_rag_result": "The president's authority to issue executive orders comes from multiple sources, primarily:\n\n1. **Article Two of the United States Constitution**: This article grants the president broad executive and enforcement authority, allowing them to use discretion in enforcing laws and managing the executive branch.\n\n2. **Acts of Congress**: The president's ability to issue executive orders is also based on express or implied Acts of Congress that delegate some degree of discretionary power to the president (known as delegated legislation).\n\nThese sources provide the legal foundation for the president to manage federal government operations through executive orders, which have the force of law and do not require Congressional approval."}
