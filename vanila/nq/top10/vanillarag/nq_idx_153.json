{"question": "is parallax more pronounced with nearby stars or with distant stars", "vanilla_rag_result": "Parallax is more pronounced with nearby stars. The apparent shift in position of a star against the background of more distant stars is more noticeable when the star is closer to Earth. As the distance to a star increases, the angle of parallax decreases, making it harder to detect. This is why parallax measurements are typically used to determine the distances of relatively nearby stars, as the effect diminishes significantly for stars that are farther away."}
