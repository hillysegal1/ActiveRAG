{"question": "who created the borders of africa's countries", "vanilla_rag_result": "The borders of Africa's countries were created by European colonial powers, specifically during the Berlin Conference in 1884-85, when Africa was divided among European nations. French military commanders and the Governors-General of French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa were also involved in defining specific borders, such as the Niger-Chad border. These borders were largely arbitrary and did not take into account the various ethnic and tribal groups present in the region."}
