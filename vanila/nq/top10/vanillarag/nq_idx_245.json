{"question": "who is the all time leading scorer in ncaa tournament history", "vanilla_rag_result": "The passages do not provide a definitive answer to who the all-time leading scorer in NCAA tournament history is. However, they mention several leading scorers in different contexts, such as Meghan Agosta becoming the all-time leading goal scorer in NCAA history for women's ice hockey and Tyler Hansbrough becoming North Carolina's all-time leading scorer. For men's basketball, the passages reference various players but do not specify an all-time leading scorer for the NCAA tournament itself. Therefore, based on the provided information, the all-time leading scorer in NCAA tournament history is not explicitly stated."}
