{"question": "who coined the phrase let them eat cake", "vanilla_rag_result": "The phrase \"Let them eat cake\" is often attributed to Marie Antoinette, but there is no evidence that she ever actually said it. The phrase originally appeared in Jean-Jacques Rousseau's autobiographical work \"Les Confessions,\" where he ascribes it to an unknown \"great princess.\" Some scholars believe Rousseau may have invented the phrase altogether. Therefore, while Rousseau is the one who recorded it, the exact origin of the phrase remains uncertain."}
