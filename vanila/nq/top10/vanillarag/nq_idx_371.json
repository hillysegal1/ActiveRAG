{"question": "how long do former presidents get secret service protection", "vanilla_rag_result": "Former presidents are entitled to lifetime Secret Service protection. However, for presidents who took office after January 1, 1997, there was a period when their protection was limited to ten years. This limitation was reversed by the Former Presidents Protection Act of 2012, which reinstated lifetime protection for all former presidents and their spouses."}
