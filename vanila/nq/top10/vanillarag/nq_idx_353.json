{"question": "who is the guy that jumped from space", "vanilla_rag_result": "The passages mention a few instances of individuals jumping from heights or into space, but the most notable reference is to Joe Kittinger, who is known for his 1960 space jump. However, the specific mention of a man jumping from a rollercoaster in Disneyland does not relate to space but rather a theme park ride. If you are referring to the context of space jumps, Joe Kittinger would be the relevant figure."}
