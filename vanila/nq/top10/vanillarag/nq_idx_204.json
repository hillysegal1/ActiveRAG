{"question": "when does the sa node begin electrical signaling", "vanilla_rag_result": "The sinoatrial (SA) node begins electrical signaling spontaneously, generating an electrical impulse (action potential) continuously. This process occurs without any external nervous or endocrine control, and the SA node initiates these impulses at a rate of approximately 80\u2013100 times per minute in a healthy heart. The electrical activity starts when a cardiac action potential arises in the SA node, which is located in the wall of the right atrium of the heart."}
