{"question": "what information is displayed in clear text from the ftp header", "vanilla_rag_result": "The passages provided do not specifically mention an FTP header or the information contained within it. However, they do discuss headers in various contexts, such as email headers and file headers. \n\nIn general, an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) header would typically include information such as:\n\n- Command type (e.g., USER, PASS, RETR, STOR)\n- Status codes (indicating the result of commands)\n- Session identifiers\n- Data transfer mode (e.g., ASCII or binary)\n- File transfer status messages\n\nSince the passages do not provide explicit details about FTP headers, it is not possible to extract specific information about what is displayed in clear text from an FTP header based on the provided text."}
