{"question": "what was the most important new religious figure of the new kingdom of ancient egypt", "vanilla_rag_result": "The most important new religious figure of the New Kingdom of ancient Egypt was Amun. During this period, Amun became the supreme state god, particularly after the reunification of Egypt by Theban rulers. His cult center, the Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak in Thebes, grew to become the largest temple, and Amun's influence was further solidified through his syncretization with Ra, the long-established patron of kingship."}
