{"question": "when are you considered under the poverty line", "vanilla_rag_result": "You are considered under the poverty line if your total income before taxes is below the poverty threshold established by the U.S. Census Bureau. The specific threshold varies based on household size and is updated annually to reflect changes in the cost of living. For example, in 2015, the poverty threshold for a single person under 65 was an annual income of $11,770, while for a family of four (including two children), it was $24,250. If an individual's or family's income falls below these thresholds, they are classified as living in poverty."}
