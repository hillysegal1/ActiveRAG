{"question": "form from material that has accumulated on the earths surface", "vanilla_rag_result": "Sedimentary rocks form from material that has accumulated on the Earth's surface. They are created through the processes of accumulation and cementation of fragments of earlier rocks, minerals, and organisms, or as chemical precipitates and organic growths in water (sedimentation). This process involves the settling and accumulation of clastic sediments (pieces of rock) or organic particles (detritus), followed by compaction and cementation at moderate temperatures and pressures."}
