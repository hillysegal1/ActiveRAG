{"question": "what process causes the continents to drift apart how", "vanilla_rag_result": "The process that causes the continents to drift apart is known as **plate tectonics**, which involves the movement of the Earth's lithosphere (the rigid outer layer of the Earth) on the more fluid asthenosphere beneath it. This movement is driven by several mechanisms, including:\n\n1. **Mantle Convection**: Heat generated from the Earth's interior causes convection currents in the mantle. These currents create forces that can push and pull tectonic plates, leading to their movement.\n\n2. **Slab Pull and Ridge Push**: \n   - **Slab Pull** occurs when a denser oceanic plate subducts (sinks) beneath a less dense continental plate, pulling the trailing plate along with it.\n   - **Ridge Push** happens at mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic crust is formed. As the new crust cools and becomes denser, it slides away from the ridge, pushing the plates apart.\n\n3. **Seafloor Spreading**: As magma rises at mid-ocean ridges and solidifies, it creates new oceanic crust, which pushes the older crust away from the ridge, causing the continents to drift apart.\n\nThese processes work together to facilitate the gradual movement of continents across the Earth's surface at rates of a few centimeters per year, leading to the dynamic configuration of continents we observe today."}
