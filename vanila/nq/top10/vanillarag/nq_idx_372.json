{"question": "what was the religion in persia before islam", "vanilla_rag_result": "Before the advent of Islam, the dominant religion in Persia (modern-day Iran) was Zoroastrianism. It was the official state religion of the Sasanian Empire and had been the state religion of previous Persian empires as well. Zoroastrianism remained the primary faith in Persia until the Arab conquest in the mid-7th century, after which Islam began to replace it as the dominant religion."}
