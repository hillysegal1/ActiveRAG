{"question": "in which sea pearl is found in india", "vanilla_rag_result": "In India, pearls are primarily found in the Gulf of Mannar, which is located between India and Sri Lanka. This area has a historical significance for pearl fishing and trade. Additionally, pearls were also sourced from the Bay of Bengal, although those pearls are noted to be softer and less durable compared to those from Basra, Iraq, before the decline of the pearl trade in that region."}
