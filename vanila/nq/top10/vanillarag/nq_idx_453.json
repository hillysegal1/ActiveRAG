{"question": "when did the ncaa tournament became more important than the nit", "vanilla_rag_result": "The NCAA tournament began to be regarded as more important than the NIT starting in the mid-1950s, particularly after the fallout from the 1951 gambling and point-shaving scandals. By 1960, the NCAA tournament had overtaken the NIT in prestige. The NCAA's expansion of its tournament and the participation of conference champions and top-ranked teams further solidified its status as the primary postseason tournament for college basketball."}
