{"question": "where does the sciatic nerve run in the foot", "vanilla_rag_result": "The sciatic nerve does not run directly in the foot; instead, it travels down the posterior aspect of the leg and divides into two branches at the popliteal fossa: the tibial nerve and the common fibular nerve. The tibial nerve innervates the plantar surface (the sole) of the foot, while the common fibular nerve innervates the upper surface of the foot. Therefore, while the sciatic nerve itself does not run in the foot, its branches are responsible for providing sensation and motor function to different parts of the foot."}
