{"question": "what does the adrenal gland produce that is necessary for the sympathetic nervous system to function", "vanilla_rag_result": "The adrenal gland produces the hormones epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline), which are necessary for the sympathetic nervous system to function. These hormones are released into the bloodstream in response to signals from the sympathetic nervous system and play a crucial role in initiating the \"fight-or-flight\" response, affecting various physiological processes such as increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels."}
