{"question": "when did movies start coming out in color", "vanilla_rag_result": "Movies began to be produced in color in the early 20th century, with significant advancements occurring in the 1930s. The first feature-length motion picture in full color was \"Becky Sharp,\" released in 1935. However, the widespread adoption of color films did not occur until the early 1950s, when the percentage of American films made in color rose from 12 percent in 1947 to over 50 percent by 1954. By the mid-1960s, color films became the standard for Hollywood productions."}
