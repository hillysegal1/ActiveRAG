{"question": "what are bulls used for on a farm", "vanilla_rag_result": "Bulls are used on farms primarily for breeding purposes. They are essential for maintaining the herd by mating with cows to produce calves. In addition to natural breeding, bulls are also used for artificial insemination (AI), where semen is collected from them and stored for later use. This allows farmers to breed their cows to high-quality bulls or to introduce new bloodlines into their herds. Furthermore, bulls may be kept for the purpose of producing semen that can be sold, which can be profitable for ranchers. In some cases, bulls are also used in roughriding events and competitions, although this is less common in traditional farming practices."}
