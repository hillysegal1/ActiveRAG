{"question": "when did they stop using aluminum wiring in ontario", "vanilla_rag_result": "The passages do not provide specific information about when aluminum wiring was stopped being used in Ontario. However, they mention that aluminum wiring was used in North American residential construction for a short time from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s. It is implied that the use of aluminum wiring declined after this period due to safety concerns, but no exact date for when it was completely stopped in Ontario is given."}
