{"question": "tools made from high-speed tool steel are generally used for what type of machining operations", "vanilla_rag_result": "Tools made from high-speed tool steel (HSS) are generally used for cutting operations, particularly in the manufacture of various cutting tools such as drills, taps, milling cutters, tool bits, and saw blades. They are especially popular in woodturning due to their ability to maintain a sharp edge longer than high carbon steel tools, making them suitable for high-speed machining applications. HSS is also used in low-speed applications requiring a durable sharp edge, such as files, chisels, and hand plane blades."}
