{"question": "who pays medical bills in great britain where does the money come from to pay these bills", "vanilla_rag_result": "In Great Britain, medical bills are primarily paid by the National Health Service (NHS), which is a comprehensive publicly funded healthcare system. The funding for the NHS comes from government taxation, meaning that the money to pay for healthcare services is collected through taxes paid by individuals and businesses. Most patients do not pay out-of-pocket for their treatment, which significantly reduces administrative costs associated with billing and invoicing.\n\nHowever, there are instances where patients who are not ordinarily resident in the UK are required to pay for their treatment, and not all of this money is collected. Additionally, some British citizens choose to pay out-of-pocket for private healthcare services to avoid waiting times associated with public healthcare."}
