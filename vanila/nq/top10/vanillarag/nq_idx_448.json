{"question": "who has won the most college football national champions", "vanilla_rag_result": "Clemson has won three NCAA Division I Football National Championships, which is mentioned in the passages. However, the passages do not provide information about other teams' national championships to determine who has won the most overall. Therefore, based on the information given, Clemson has three national championships, but we cannot conclude if they have the most without additional context about other teams."}
