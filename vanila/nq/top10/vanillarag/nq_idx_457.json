{"question": "what does the m number mean on a pint glass", "vanilla_rag_result": "The M-ratio (or M number) mentioned in the passages refers to a concept in poker, specifically in tournament play, and is not directly related to pint glasses. It measures the health of a player's chip stack in relation to the cost to play each round. A high M number indicates that a player can afford to wait several rounds before needing to make a move.\n\nIn the context of pint glasses, there is no mention of an M number or M ratio. The passages primarily discuss the measurements and standards for pint glasses in different countries, but they do not connect this to the poker terminology. Therefore, the M number does not have a meaning related to pint glasses."}
