{"question": "what does the air gap do on a dishwasher", "vanilla_rag_result": "The air gap on a dishwasher provides back-flow prevention, ensuring that drain water from the sink does not back up into the dishwasher. It is a small cylindrical fixture mounted above the sink that connects the dishwasher's drain hose to the sink drain or garbage disposal. When installed and maintained properly, the air gap prevents potentially contaminated water from the sink from entering the dishwasher, thereby protecting the cleanliness of the dishes. If water flows from the air gap into the sink, it indicates a need for maintenance or repair."}
