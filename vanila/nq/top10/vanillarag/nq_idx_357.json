{"question": "where would the group bacteroids likely be found", "vanilla_rag_result": "Bacteroidetes are likely to be found in a variety of habitats on Earth, including:\n\n1. **Gut microbiota** - They are commonly associated with the digestive systems of animals.\n2. **Rhizosphere** - They are among the most abundant bacterial groups in the soil surrounding plant roots.\n3. **Soil samples** - They have been detected in cultivated fields, greenhouse soils, and unexploited areas.\n4. **Freshwater environments** - They inhabit lakes and rivers.\n5. **Marine environments** - They are recognized as an important part of the bacterioplankton in pelagic oceans and are also found in coastal sediments and deep sea sediments.\n6. **Hypersaline environments** - The genus Salinibacter, a type of Bacteroidetes, inhabits salt-saturated brines in hypersaline lakes.\n\nOverall, Bacteroidetes have a wide distribution across various ecosystems, both terrestrial and aquatic."}
