{"question": "which state was returned to spain after the revolutionary war", "vanilla_rag_result": "After the revolutionary war, specifically following the Spanish Civil War and the subsequent establishment of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931, the state that was returned to Spain was the Generalitat of Catalonia. This was an autonomous government that had been established in Catalonia, which had lost its powers after the fall of the Second Spanish Republic at the end of the Civil War in 1939. After Franco's death in 1975 and the adoption of a democratic constitution in 1978, Catalonia was able to recover and extend the powers it had previously gained."}
