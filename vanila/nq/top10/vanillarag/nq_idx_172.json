{"question": "where is arachidonic acid found in the body", "vanilla_rag_result": "Arachidonic acid is found in the phospholipids of cell membranes throughout the body, particularly in the brain, muscles, and liver. It is especially abundant in skeletal muscle, where it accounts for roughly 10-20% of the phospholipid fatty acid content. Additionally, it is one of the most abundant fatty acids in the brain, present in similar quantities to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)."}
