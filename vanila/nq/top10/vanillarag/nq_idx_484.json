{"question": "why wasnt agent matthews in miss congeniality 2", "vanilla_rag_result": "Agent Matthews, played by Benjamin Bratt, was not in \"Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous\" likely due to the narrative direction of the sequel, which focused on different plot elements and character developments. The film primarily centers around Gracie Hart, portrayed by Sandra Bullock, and her new adventures, which may not have necessitated the presence of Agent Matthews. Additionally, casting decisions can be influenced by various factors, including the actors' availability, creative choices by the filmmakers, or a shift in the storyline that did not include his character."}
