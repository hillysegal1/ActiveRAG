{"question": "what is the poorest county in the state of florida", "vanilla_rag_result": "The passages do not explicitly state which county is the poorest in Florida. However, they mention that Lafayette County is one of the dry counties in Florida, and they indicate that North Florida and the rural counties of the Florida Panhandle are the most impoverished in the state. For a definitive answer regarding the poorest county in Florida, additional information or data would be needed."}
