{"question": "what type of writing did ancient egypt use", "vanilla_rag_result": "Ancient Egypt used several types of writing, primarily:\n\n1. **Hieroglyphs**: This was the formal writing system that combined logographic, syllabic, and alphabetic elements, consisting of about 1,000 distinct characters.\n\n2. **Hieratic**: This was a cursive form of writing used alongside hieroglyphs, especially during the Old and Middle Egyptian periods. It became the dominant form of writing in Late Egyptian.\n\n3. **Demotic**: This was a later script that evolved from hieratic and was used from the New Kingdom onward.\n\n4. **Coptic**: This is the final stage of the Egyptian language, which used the Greek alphabet with some additional characters.\n\nAdditionally, writing in Ancient Egypt included various forms of literature, such as historical records, autobiographies, hymns, and funerary spells, primarily written in Classical Egyptian."}
