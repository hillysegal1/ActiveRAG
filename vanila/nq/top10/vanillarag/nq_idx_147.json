{"question": "other than water what else has hydrogen bonds", "vanilla_rag_result": "Other than water, hydrogen bonds can be formed by molecules such as hydrogen fluoride (HF), ammonia (NH3), and methanol (CH3OH). These molecules can also participate in hydrogen bonding, but they do not exhibit the same anomalous properties as water because they cannot form four hydrogen bonds like water can."}
