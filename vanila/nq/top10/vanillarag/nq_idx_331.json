{"question": "where can you find dna in the body", "vanilla_rag_result": "DNA in the human body can be found in two primary locations:\n\n1. **Nucleus**: Most of the DNA is located in the cell nucleus, where it exists as chromatin during non-replicative stages and condenses into chromosomes during cell division.\n\n2. **Mitochondria**: A smaller amount of DNA, known as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), is found in the mitochondria, which are cellular organelles responsible for energy production.\n\nAdditionally, DNA can be obtained from various biological materials such as hair follicles, blood, and tissue for identification purposes."}
