{"question": "what allows chyme to enter the small intestine", "vanilla_rag_result": "Chyme enters the small intestine through the pyloric sphincter, which is a valve located at the junction between the stomach and the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). When the pyloric sphincter opens, it allows the thick semi-liquid mass of partly digested food, known as chyme, to pass from the stomach into the duodenum."}
