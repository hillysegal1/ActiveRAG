{"question": "who came up with popcorn at the movies", "vanilla_rag_result": "Samuel M. Rubin is credited with the mass introduction of popcorn machines to cinemas, popularizing the practice of selling popcorn in theaters. However, Charles Cretors invented the first popcorn machine in 1885, which laid the groundwork for popcorn's introduction to movie theaters. While there is some uncertainty about who was the first to sell popcorn in theaters, Rubin is widely recognized for making it a common practice in cinemas."}
