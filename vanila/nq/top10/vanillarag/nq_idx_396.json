{"question": "what is the biggest determinant of climate in venezuela", "vanilla_rag_result": "The biggest determinant of climate in Venezuela is altitude. While the country's geographical location near the Equator contributes to its tropical and isothermal climate, the dramatic changes in temperature and climatic conditions are primarily influenced by the varying altitudes across the region. Different thermal floors result in distinct climate zones, which can range from warm climates at lower altitudes to much cooler conditions in higher elevations."}
