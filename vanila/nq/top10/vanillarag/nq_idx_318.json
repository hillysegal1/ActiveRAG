{"question": "who is the president of the republic of zambia", "vanilla_rag_result": "The passage does not provide the name of the current President of Zambia. However, it mentions that the First Lady of Zambia is Esther Lungu, who has held the office since 25 January 2015. To find the current President, you may need to look up recent information, as my training only includes data up to October 2023."}
