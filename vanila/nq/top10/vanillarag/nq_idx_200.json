{"question": "what does it mean to fuse the spine", "vanilla_rag_result": "To fuse the spine means to surgically join two or more vertebrae together, preventing any movement between them. This procedure is typically performed to stabilize the spine, alleviate pain, or address issues such as degenerative disc disease or infections like vertebral osteomyelitis. The fusion is achieved using bone grafts (which can be taken from the patient, a donor, or be artificial substitutes) placed between the vertebrae, along with additional hardware such as screws, plates, or rods to hold the bones in place while they heal together. The goal of spinal fusion is to create a solid, stable segment of the spine."}
