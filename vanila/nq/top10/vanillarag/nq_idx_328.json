{"question": "what does a heart rate of 131 mean", "vanilla_rag_result": "A heart rate of 131 beats per minute is considered elevated and falls into the category of tachycardia, as it is above the normal resting heart rate range (typically 60 to 100 beats per minute). Specifically, it exceeds the threshold for accelerated idioventricular rhythm, which is defined as a heart rate between 40 and 120 beats per minute. A heart rate of 131 may indicate an increased risk of heart-related issues, as higher heart rates have been correlated with a higher incidence of heart attacks and hospitalizations, according to the study mentioned in the passages. Therefore, a heart rate of 131 could suggest a potential medical concern that may require further evaluation."}
