{"question": "who were the first non native settlers in the us", "vanilla_rag_result": "The first non-Native settlers in the United States were primarily English Puritans who settled in New England during the colonial era. These settlers, often referred to as \"Yankee\" settlers, began arriving in various regions, such as Adams County, Whitley County, Boone County, and Decatur, around the mid-1830s, particularly after the end of the Black Hawk War and the completion of the Erie Canal. They were predominantly members of the Congregational Church, with many converting to Methodism or becoming Baptists over time. \n\nIn addition to these early settlers, there were also significant non-Native American populations that arrived later, including African Americans who found refuge among the Seminoles in Florida and other immigrant groups from Germany and Ireland in the late 19th century."}
