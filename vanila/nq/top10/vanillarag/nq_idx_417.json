{"question": "when did they stop saying mass in latin", "vanilla_rag_result": "Mass was said in Latin until around 1964, when Vatican II's directives came into effect. However, it is important to note that while the use of the vernacular was expanded and priests were no longer obliged to use Latin in any part of the Mass by the time the revised Missal was published in 1970, Latin is still permitted and used in some places."}
