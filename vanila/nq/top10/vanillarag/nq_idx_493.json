{"question": "where is the tablet of the ten commandments", "vanilla_rag_result": "The tablets of the Ten Commandments, according to the Hebrew Bible, were inscribed with the commandments when Moses ascended Mount Sinai. They are referred to as the \"Tablets of the Law\" or \"Tablets of Stone\" and are described in Exodus 34:1. Historically, the tablets were placed in the Ark of the Covenant, which was kept in the Tabernacle, a sacred space for worship. The specific location of the original tablets today is not known, as they are considered to have been lost or hidden after the destruction of the First Temple in Jerusalem."}
