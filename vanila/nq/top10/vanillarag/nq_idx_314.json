{"question": "when did they start assigning social security numbers at birth", "vanilla_rag_result": "Social Security numbers began to be assigned at birth following the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which required parents to list Social Security numbers for each dependent over the age of 5 for tax deductions. Over the years, the age threshold was lowered, and by 1990, it was required for children regardless of age to receive an exemption. As a result, parents started applying for Social Security numbers for their children soon after birth, and this practice has continued."}
