{"question": "when did computer become widespread in homes and schools", "vanilla_rag_result": "Computers began to gain widespread acceptance in schools by the early 1980s, with significant integration occurring during that period. By 1989, computer usage had shifted from being relatively rare in American public schools to being present in nearly every school district. In homes, the arrival of personal computers, particularly with models like the Altair 8800 in 1975 and subsequent models in the late 1970s and early 1980s, contributed to the growing presence of computers in family life. Predictions during that time suggested that computers would soon revolutionize many aspects of home and family life, indicating a trend towards widespread use in homes as well."}
