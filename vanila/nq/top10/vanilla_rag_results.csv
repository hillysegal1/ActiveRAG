282,"The process that causes the continents to drift apart is known as **plate tectonics**, which involves the movement of the Earth's lithosphere (the rigid outer layer of the Earth) on the more fluid asthenosphere beneath it. This movement is driven by several mechanisms, including:

1. **Mantle Convection**: Heat generated from the Earth's interior causes convection currents in the mantle. These currents create forces that can push and pull tectonic plates, leading to their movement.

2. **Slab Pull and Ridge Push**: 
   - **Slab Pull** occurs when a denser oceanic plate subducts (sinks) beneath a less dense continental plate, pulling the trailing plate along with it.
   - **Ridge Push** happens at mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic crust is formed. As the new crust cools and becomes denser, it slides away from the ridge, pushing the plates apart.

3. **Seafloor Spreading**: As magma rises at mid-ocean ridges and solidifies, it creates new oceanic crust, which pushes the older crust away from the ridge, causing the continents to drift apart.

2. **Historical Trade Routes**: Throughout the 14th century, the Sahara was central to African trade, particularly through the Trans-Saharan trade routes.
