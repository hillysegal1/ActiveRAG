{"question": "two examples where low voltage transformers are used", "vanilla_rag_result": "Two examples where low voltage transformers are used are:\n\n1. **Electronically controlled toaster**: In this application, the timer circuit operates off extra low voltage derived from a tap on the heating element.\n  \n2. **Doorbell circuit**: This circuit is typically fed from a transformer that converts standard voltage to extra low voltage for safe operation."}
