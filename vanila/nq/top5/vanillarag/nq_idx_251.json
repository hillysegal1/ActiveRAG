{"question": "where does the president get authority to issue executive orders", "vanilla_rag_result": "The president derives the authority to issue executive orders from multiple sources, primarily from Article Two of the United States Constitution, which grants the president broad executive and enforcement authority. This allows the president to use discretion in enforcing laws and managing the executive branch. Additionally, the authority to issue executive orders can also stem from express or implied Acts of Congress that delegate some degree of discretionary power to the president."}
