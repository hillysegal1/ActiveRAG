{"question": "when are you considered under the poverty line", "vanilla_rag_result": "You are considered under the poverty line if your total income before taxes is below the poverty threshold, which is the minimum level of income deemed necessary to meet basic needs for healthy living, including food, shelter, and clothing. This applies to both families and single individuals, where all members of a family share the same poverty status if the family's income is below the threshold."}
