{"question": "what is the snow on mars made of", "vanilla_rag_result": "The snow on Mars is primarily made of water ice, as indicated by findings from researchers at the California Institute of Technology in 2003. While dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide) forms a thin surface layer that varies seasonally, the main component of Mars' polar caps and the ice-rich mantle is water ice."}
