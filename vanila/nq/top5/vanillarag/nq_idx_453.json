{"question": "when did the ncaa tournament became more important than the nit", "vanilla_rag_result": "The NCAA tournament became more important than the NIT in the mid-1950s, particularly after the fallout from the 1951 gambling and point-shaving scandals. By the end of the 1950s, the NCAA tournament had established itself as the more prestigious postseason tournament, especially following the NCAA's decision to require that its tournament would have \"first choice\" in determining teams for its field. The NCAA tournament continued to gain prominence throughout the 1960s and 1970s, ultimately overtaking the NIT by 1960."}
