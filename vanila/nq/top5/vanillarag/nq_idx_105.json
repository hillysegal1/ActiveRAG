{"question": "who pays medical bills in great britain where does the money come from to pay these bills", "vanilla_rag_result": "In Great Britain, medical bills are primarily paid by the government through the National Health Service (NHS), which provides healthcare services funded by taxation. However, there can also be instances where individuals pay for their own healthcare, either directly or through employer-run schemes and insurance companies. The funding for healthcare can thus come from a combination of government funding and individual contributions, but ultimately, the government plays a significant role in covering the costs of healthcare services for the population."}
