{"question": "where is arachidonic acid found in the body", "vanilla_rag_result": "Arachidonic acid is found in the phospholipids of the membranes of the body's cells, particularly in phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylinositides. It is abundant in the brain, muscles, and liver, with skeletal muscle being an especially active site of arachidonic acid retention, accounting for roughly 10-20% of the phospholipid fatty acid content. Additionally, it is one of the most abundant fatty acids in the brain, present in similar quantities to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)."}
