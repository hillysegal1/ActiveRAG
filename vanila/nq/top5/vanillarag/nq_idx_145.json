{"question": "tools made from high-speed tool steel are generally used for what type of machining operations", "vanilla_rag_result": "Tools made from high-speed tool steel (HSS) are generally used for various cutting operations, particularly in the manufacture of cutting tools such as drills, taps, milling cutters, tool bits, and saw blades. They are especially popular for woodturning due to their ability to maintain a sharp edge longer than high carbon steel tools, making them suitable for high-speed machining operations where the speed of movement of the workpiece is relatively high. HSS is commonly used when a special tool shape is needed and is not typically used for high production processes compared to carbide or ceramic tools."}
