{"question": "what information is displayed in clear text from the ftp header", "vanilla_rag_result": "The provided passages do not specifically mention an FTP header or its contents. However, based on general knowledge of email headers and file headers, an FTP header typically includes information such as the command being executed, the status of the connection, and possibly details about the file being transferred (like file name, size, and type). \n\nIn the context of the passages, it is noted that headers generally contain identifying information, and in the case of email headers, they include fields such as From, To, CC, Subject, and Date. If we were to draw a parallel, an FTP header might similarly contain fields relevant to the transfer process, but this specific information is not detailed in the provided text. \n\nIf you are looking for specific clear text information from an FTP header, it would generally include the command (like GET or PUT), status codes, and other relevant metadata about the file transfer."}
