{"question": "other than water what else has hydrogen bonds", "vanilla_rag_result": "Other than water, hydrogen bonds can also be formed by molecules such as hydrogen fluoride (HF), ammonia (NH\u2083), and methanol (CH\u2083OH). However, these molecules do not exhibit the same anomalous thermodynamic, kinetic, or structural properties as water because they cannot form four hydrogen bonds like water can."}
