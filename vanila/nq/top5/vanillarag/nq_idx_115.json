{"question": "form from material that has accumulated on the earths surface", "vanilla_rag_result": "Sedimentary rocks form from material that has accumulated on the Earth's surface through processes such as the accumulation and cementation of fragments of earlier rocks, minerals, and organisms, or as chemical precipitates and organic growths in water. This accumulation can involve clastic sediments (pieces of rock) or organic particles (detritus) settling and accumulating, as well as minerals chemically precipitating (evaporite) from a solution. Over time, this particulate matter undergoes compaction and cementation at moderate temperatures and pressures, a process known as diagenesis."}
