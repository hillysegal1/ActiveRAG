{"question": "is parallax more pronounced with nearby stars or with distant stars", "vanilla_rag_result": "Parallax is more pronounced with nearby stars. The concept of parallax relies on the apparent shift in position of a star against a more distant background when observed from different positions in Earth's orbit around the Sun. This effect is more noticeable for stars that are closer to Earth, as they exhibit a larger angular shift compared to more distant stars, which show a smaller shift due to their greater distance. Therefore, the closer a star is, the more pronounced its parallax will be."}
