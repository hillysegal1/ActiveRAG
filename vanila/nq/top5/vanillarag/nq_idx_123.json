{"question": "what is best thing i never had song about", "vanilla_rag_result": "\"Best Thing I Never Had\" is thematically a kiss-off song. It expresses a sense of empowerment and relief after a breakup, highlighting the idea that the person being addressed was not worth the singer's time or affection. The song conveys a message of self-worth and liberation, suggesting that the singer is better off without the relationship. This theme is similar to other songs by Beyonc\u00e9, such as \"Irreplaceable\" and \"If I Were a Boy,\" which also deal with themes of independence and moving on from unfulfilling relationships."}
