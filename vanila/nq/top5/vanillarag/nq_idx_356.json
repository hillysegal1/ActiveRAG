{"question": "a bond that the issuer has the right to pay off before its maturity date", "vanilla_rag_result": "A bond that the issuer has the right to pay off before its maturity date is typically referred to as a callable bond. Callable bonds include provisions that allow the issuer to redeem the bond at a specified price before the maturity date, often after a certain period has passed. This feature can be beneficial for the issuer if interest rates decline, as they can refinance the debt at a lower cost."}
