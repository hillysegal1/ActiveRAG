{"question": "what does a heart rate of 131 mean", "vanilla_rag_result": "A heart rate of 131 beats per minute falls into the category of accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR), which is defined as a ventricular rhythm with a rate between 40 and 120 beats per minute. However, since 131 beats per minute exceeds this range, it would be classified as ventricular tachycardia, which is a faster ventricular rhythm. This elevated heart rate may indicate a potential cardiac issue and could be associated with an increased risk of heart attack, as higher heart rates have been linked to a greater incidence of heart attacks and hospitalizations in patients with cardiovascular disease."}
