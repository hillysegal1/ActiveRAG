{"question": "what process causes the continents to drift apart how", "vanilla_rag_result": "The process that causes the continents to drift apart is known as **continental drift**, which is now understood in the context of **plate tectonics**. This theory explains that the Earth's continents move over geologic time due to the movement of tectonic plates that make up the Earth's lithosphere. \n\nThe mechanisms behind this movement include:\n\n1. **Slab Pull**: This occurs when a tectonic plate sinks into the mantle at a subduction zone, pulling the rest of the plate along with it.\n   \n2. **Ridge Push**: This happens at mid-ocean ridges where new oceanic crust is formed. As the new crust cools and becomes denser, it pushes the older crust away from the ridge.\n\n3. **Mantle Convection**: Proposed by Arthur Holmes, this mechanism involves the movement of the mantle's molten rock, which creates currents that can cause the tectonic plates to move.\n\nThese processes lead to the gradual separation and movement of continents, as they ride on the tectonic plates that are constantly shifting due to the dynamics of the Earth's interior."}
