{"question": "what are bulls used for on a farm", "vanilla_rag_result": "Bulls are used on farms primarily for breeding purposes. They play a crucial role in herd maintenance by mating with cows to produce offspring. In addition to natural breeding, bulls are also used for artificial insemination (AI), where semen is collected from bulls and stored for later use. This allows farmers to breed their cows with high-quality bulls or to introduce new bloodlines into their herds. Furthermore, bulls can be kept specifically for the purpose of semen collection, which can be profitable for ranchers. Overall, bulls contribute to the reproductive management and genetic improvement of cattle herds on farms."}
