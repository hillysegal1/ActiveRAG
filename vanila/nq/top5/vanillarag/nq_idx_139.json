{"question": "what is the form of mozart symphony no 40", "vanilla_rag_result": "The form of Mozart's Symphony No. 40 in G minor typically follows the classical symphonic structure, which consists of four movements. The movements are generally arranged as follows:\n\n1. **Allegro** - The first movement is in sonata form, characterized by its dramatic and intense themes.\n2. **Andante** - The second movement is more lyrical and reflective, often in a ternary (ABA) form.\n3. **Menuetto and Trio** - The third movement is a minuet and trio, which is a dance-like movement.\n4. **Allegro assai** - The final movement returns to a fast tempo, also in sonata form, bringing the symphony to a vigorous conclusion.\n\nThis structure is typical of classical symphonies and showcases Mozart's mastery of orchestration and thematic development."}
