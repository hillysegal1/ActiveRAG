{"question": "where does the grapes of wrath take place", "vanilla_rag_result": "The passages provided do not specify a particular location for \"The Grapes of Wrath,\" as they focus on different adaptations of John Steinbeck's novel, including an opera and a play. However, the original novel by Steinbeck is set during the Great Depression and primarily follows the journey of the Joad family from Oklahoma to California, highlighting the struggles faced by migrant workers. Therefore, the setting of \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is primarily in Oklahoma and California."}
