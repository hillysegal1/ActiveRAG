{"question": "when did movies start coming out in color", "vanilla_rag_result": "Movies began to come out in color with the development of early color processes in the 1910s, but the first feature-length motion picture in full color was \"Becky Sharp,\" released in 1935. Prior to that, films were typically shot in black-and-white and then hand-colored or machine-colored afterwards. The prevalence of color films increased significantly in the 1950s, particularly due to the rise of television and the breakup of Technicolor's monopoly on color film production. By 1954, over 50 percent of American films were made in color."}
