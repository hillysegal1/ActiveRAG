{"question": "who were the first non native settlers in the us", "vanilla_rag_result": "The first non-Native American settlers in the regions mentioned in the passages were primarily \"Yankee\" settlers from New England, descended from the English Puritans who settled in New England during the colonial era. They began arriving in various areas, such as Adams County, Whitley County, and Boone County, around 1835, encouraged by factors like the end of the Black Hawk War and the completion of the Erie Canal. These settlers were primarily members of the Congregational Church, although many had converted to Methodism or become Baptists due to the Second Great Awakening."}
