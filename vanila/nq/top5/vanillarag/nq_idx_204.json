{"question": "when does the sa node begin electrical signaling", "vanilla_rag_result": "The SA node begins electrical signaling when its specialized cells reach the threshold for spontaneous depolarization. This occurs at a rate of approximately 80\u2013100 times per minute in the absence of nervous or endocrine control. The SA node generates an action potential that initiates the electrical impulses that propagate throughout the heart, leading to the contraction of the heart muscle."}
