{"question": "what is the first line of an http request to the server", "vanilla_rag_result": "The first line of an HTTP request to the server is called the \"request line.\" It typically includes the HTTP method (such as GET or POST), the requested resource (such as a URL), and the HTTP version being used. For example, a request line might look like this:\n\n```\nGET /index.html HTTP/1.1\n``` \n\nThis line indicates that the client is requesting the resource located at `/index.html` using the GET method and is using HTTP version 1.1."}
