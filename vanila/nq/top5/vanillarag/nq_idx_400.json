{"question": "where does the sciatic nerve run in the foot", "vanilla_rag_result": "The sciatic nerve runs through the back of each leg and into the feet. However, it does not directly supply sensation to the foot; instead, it branches into the tibial nerve and the common fibular nerve, which provide sensation to different parts of the foot. The tibial nerve supplies sensation to the sole of the foot, while the common fibular nerve supplies sensation to the lower leg and the upper surface of the foot."}
