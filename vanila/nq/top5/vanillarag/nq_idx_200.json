{"question": "what does it mean to fuse the spine", "vanilla_rag_result": "To fuse the spine means to surgically join two or more vertebrae together to prevent movement between them. This is typically done using a technique that involves bone grafting\u2014either from the patient, a donor, or artificial substitutes\u2014to promote healing and solidify the connection between the vertebrae. Additional hardware, such as screws and plates, is often used to stabilize the vertebrae during the healing process. The procedure is commonly performed to address issues such as severe degenerative disc disease or infections affecting the spine, and it aims to alleviate pain and restore stability to the spinal column."}
