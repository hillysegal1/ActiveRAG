{"question": "what was the most important new religious figure of the new kingdom of ancient egypt", "vanilla_rag_result": "The most important new religious figure of the New Kingdom of ancient Egypt was Amun. He became the supreme state god, and his cult center, the Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak in Thebes, grew to be the largest of all temples. Amun's elevation in status was partly due to the importance of Thebes and the increasingly professional priesthood that supported his worship."}
