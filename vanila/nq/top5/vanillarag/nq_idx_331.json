{"question": "where can you find dna in the body", "vanilla_rag_result": "DNA in the body can be found in two primary locations within human cells: \n\n1. **Nucleus**: Nuclear DNA (nDNA) is located in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. It exists as chromatin during non-replicative stages and is condensed into chromosomes during cell division.\n\n2. **Mitochondria**: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is found inside the mitochondria, which are cellular organelles responsible for energy production.\n\nAdditionally, DNA can be obtained from various biological materials such as hair follicles, blood, and tissue for identification purposes."}
