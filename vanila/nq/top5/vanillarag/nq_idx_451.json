{"question": "what does the adrenal gland produce that is necessary for the sympathetic nervous system to function", "vanilla_rag_result": "The adrenal gland produces norepinephrine and epinephrine (also known as noradrenaline and adrenaline, respectively), which are necessary for the sympathetic nervous system to function. These chemical messengers are released into the bloodstream and play a crucial role in the body's \"fight-or-flight\" responses, as well as in regulating various physiological processes such as heart rate, blood pressure, and glucose levels."}
