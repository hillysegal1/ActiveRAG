{"question": "what is the revolution period of venus in earth years", "vanilla_rag_result": "The revolution period of Venus, also known as its sidereal period, is approximately 225 Earth days. To convert this into Earth years, we can use the fact that there are about 365.25 days in a year (accounting for leap years).\n\nSo, the calculation is as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revolution period of Venus in Earth years} = \\frac{225 \\text{ days}}{365.25 \\text{ days/year}} \\approx 0.616 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the revolution period of Venus is approximately 0.616 Earth years."}
