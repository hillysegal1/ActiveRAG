{"question": "who has won the most united states championships", "vanilla_rag_result": "Based on the passages provided, it appears that the driver with the most championships is A. J. Foyt, who won seven USAC titles. However, the passages also mention \"Most championships: 14,\" \"Most championships: 20,\" and \"Most championships: 18,\" but do not specify who these championships belong to. Therefore, it is unclear from the information given who has won the most United States championships overall. If you are referring specifically to A. J. Foyt, he has seven USAC titles, but the other numbers suggest there may be others with more championships in different contexts."}
