{"question": "what does the air gap do on a dishwasher", "vanilla_rag_result": "The air gap on a dishwasher provides back-flow prevention, ensuring that drain water from the sink does not back up into the dishwasher. It is a fixture that is installed above the sink and is connected to the dishwasher's drain hose. When functioning properly, the air gap prevents potentially contaminated water from the sink from entering the dishwasher, thereby protecting the cleanliness of the dishes. If water flows from the air gap into the sink, it indicates a need for maintenance or repair."}
