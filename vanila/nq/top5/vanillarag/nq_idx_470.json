{"question": "what is loihi and where does it originate from", "vanilla_rag_result": "Lohi, also referred to as Lodhi (or Lodi, Lozi), is a Munda language or possibly a dialect cluster found in India. It has been significantly influenced by neighboring Austroasiatic languages. The language is associated with the Lodhi community, which primarily consists of agriculturalists in India. While the Lodhi community has roots in Madhya Pradesh, they originally emigrated from Uttar Pradesh. The classification of Lohi is complex, as it is recognized as related to Sora, another Munda language, but is also classified as Indic (specifically Bengali\u2013Assamese) by \"Ethnologue\" and considered a variety of Hindi in the Indian census."}
